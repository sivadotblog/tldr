[### What if AI could reverse-engineer your legacy systems without source code? (Sponsor)](https://www.thoughtworks.com/ai/works?utm_source=publisher-display-TLDR&amp;utm_medium=paid-media&amp;utm_campaign=platforms_rp-gl-pspt_ai-works_2026-02)

Legacy systems don't just age. They collapse into the "legacy black hole" - where complexity compounds until the system actively resists understanding. The architects have left. The documentation never existed. Looking for source code? Good luck.

Today, modernization projects take 4x longer than planned. [But with AI, there's a way to change this math](https://www.thoughtworks.com/ai/works?utm_source=publisher-display-TLDR&utm_medium=paid-media&utm_campaign=platforms_rp-gl-pspt_ai-works_2026-02). You can modernize in 3 months, not 3 years.

[AI/works™](https://www.thoughtworks.com/ai/works?utm_source=publisher-display-TLDR&utm_medium=paid-media&utm_campaign=platforms_rp-gl-pspt_ai-works_2026-02) is Thoughtworks' new Agentic Development Platform. It reconstructs functional blueprints from observable evidence: UI interactions, database mutations, network traces, compiled binaries.

And the best part? Your new systems don't start aging the moment you deploy them.

### Headlines & Launches

[### GLM-5: From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering (1 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/11/glm-5/?utm_source=tldrai)

GLM-5 is a new MIT-licensed model with 754 billion parameters. It delivers significant improvement compared to GLM-4.7 across a wide range of academic benchmarks and achieves best-in-class performance among all open-source models on reasoning, coding, and agentic tasks. GLM-5 is designed for complex systems engineering and long-horizon agentic tasks. It has been open-sourced on Hugging Face and ModelScope and can be tried for free on Z.ai.

[### OpenAI works on ChatGPT Skills, upgrades Deep Research (3 minute read)](https://www.testingcatalog.com/openai-works-on-chatgpt-skills-upgrades-deep-research/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's revamped Deep Research in ChatGPT introduces interactive sessions, allowing constraints on specific websites and app contexts, powered by GPT-5.2. The update benefits analysts, researchers, and professionals by enhancing source control, mid-process intervention, and report clarity. Anticipation grows for GPT-5.3, and potential ChatGPT "Skills" could standardize workflows with installable instructions for repeatable procedures.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### How Codex Built an Internal Product (15 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI described an internal experiment where a small team shipped a product whose codebase—app logic, tests, CI, docs, and tooling—was generated entirely by Codex agents rather than written by humans.

[### How Cognition Uses Devin to Build Devin (11 minute read)](https://nader.substack.com/p/how-cognition-uses-devin-to-build?utm_source=tldrai)

Cognition's Devin is a cloud agent platform for engineering teams. It acts like a teammate, handling tasks and creating PRs. Cognition uses Devin for tasks like targeted refactors, bug fixes, PR review, writing unit tests, modernizations and migrations, and more. As a general rule, if a junior engineer could figure it out with sufficient instructions, it's a task Devin can likely complete. However, Devin still struggles with large-scale challenges, UI aesthetics, mobile development, and anything requiring extensive testing and validation.

[### Perplexity Comet: A Reversing Story (12 minute read)](https://labs.zenity.io/p/perplexity-comet-a-reversing-story?utm_source=tldrai)

Comet is an agentic browser that features an AI model that can interact with web pages autonomously. This post details Comet's architecture and explains how the model communicates with the browser, which tools are available, and how the model perceives and interacts with web page content. The browser's architecture is mature and thoughtful. It exposes the model to access to downloads, form filling, file uploads, and arbitrary navigation.

[### Your LLM crashed. Was it the prompt, the model, or the retrieval step? (Sponsor)](https://www.datadoghq.com/resources/llm-observability-best-practices/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=dg-coreplatform-ww-llm-observability-guide-tldr-ai)

When your AI agent hallucinates or a prompt injection slips through, traditional monitoring won't tell you why. [Datadog's free guide](https://www.datadoghq.com/resources/llm-observability-best-practices/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=dg-coreplatform-ww-llm-observability-guide-tldr-ai) to LLM observability breaks down how to monitor multi-step chains, catch prompt injection attempts, and spot quality issues before users do.

[### The LLM Context Tax: Best Tips for Tax Avoidance (18 minute read)](https://www.nicolasbustamante.com/p/the-llm-context-tax-best-tips-for?utm_source=tldrai)

The best teams building sustainable agentic products are obsessing over token efficiency. Every wasted token is setting money on fire. The context tax can be avoided with the right architecture. While context engineering isn't glamorous, it is the difference between a demo that impresses and a product that scales with decent gross margin.

[### The two patterns by which agents connect sandboxes (8 minute read)](https://x.com/hwchase17/status/2021261552222158955?utm_source=tldrai)

Sandboxes provide a workspace where agents can run code, install packages, and access files. There are two architectural patterns for integrating agents with sandboxes. The first is where an agent runs inside the sandbox, and the developer communicates with it over the network. The other is when an agent runs locally on a developer's server and then calls a sandbox remotely for execution. deepagents, an open-source agent framework with built-in sandbox support, supports both patterns with a simple configuration.

[### Skills in OpenAI API (14 minute read)](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/skills_in_api/?utm_source=tldrai)

The OpenAI API now supports skills, reusable bundles of files that detail repeatable workflows. Agent Skills lets developers upload and reuse versioned skills in hosted and local shell environments. Skills should be used when developers want models to follow a repeatable workflow, use scripts or templates, or execute code in a sandbox. This post details how to create skills via API.
