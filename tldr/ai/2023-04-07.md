### Headlines & Launches

[### Chroma‚Äôs $18m seed funding (1 minute read)](https://www.trychroma.com/blog/seed?utm_source=tldrai)

Another big funding announcement for an open source tool for AI. This time the fast growing embeddings database company raises cash. They‚Äôre hoping that folks will use their tools to add state and memory to different LLM applications. The goal is for this to reduce hallucinations and increase factuality. They‚Äôre growing quickly, it‚Äôll be interesting to see how all the different LLMOps tools come together.

[### Fixie raises $17M seed funding (2 minute read)](https://medium.com/redpoint-ventures/fresh-ink-welcoming-fixie-the-architect-of-next-gen-llm-powered-agents-27d27cc47e22?utm_source=tldrai)

Fixie is developing a platform for companies to integrate Large Language Models into their products. The seed round was led by Redpoint, SignalFire, and Zetta Venture Partners.

### Research & Innovation

[### Vision Transformers with Mixed-Resolution Tokenization (8 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00287?utm_source=tldrai)

The paper proposes a new approach to Vision Transformers by introducing a mixed-resolution sequence of tokens to replace the standard uniform grid, where each token represents a patch of arbitrary size. This approach uses the Quadtree algorithm and a novel saliency scorer to construct a patch mosaic that processes important image regions with higher resolution while routing low-saliency areas in low resolution, resulting in significant accuracy gains on image classification while controlling for the computational budget.

[### How does training a model with RLHF actually work? (17 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/stackllama?utm_source=tldrai)

Training a model on an unsupervised dataset is so last year. Using human feedback data is all the rage and while it sounds easy in theory - it turns out to be tricky in practice. The HuggingFace folks have written another great blog showcasing StackLLaMA which answers StackExchange-like questions.

[### VideoCrafter: A Toolkit for Text-to-Video Generation and Editing (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/VideoCrafter/VideoCrafter?utm_source=tldrai)

VideoCrafter is an open-source video generation and editing toolbox for crafting video content, which contains three models: Generic Text-to-video Generation, Personalized Text-to-Video Generation with LoRA, and Video Generation with More Condition Controls

[### TM2D: Bimodality Driven 3D Dance Generation via Music-Text Integration (GitHub Repo)](https://garfield-kh.github.io/TM2D/?utm_source=tldrai)

The paper proposes a new task that utilizes both music and text for 3D dance generation, which can guide humans to perform richer movements. To tackle the challenge of the existing datasets containing paired motion with a single modality, the authors utilize a 3D human motion VQ-VAE to project the motions of the two datasets into a latent space, and propose a cross-modal transformer architecture to integrate text instructions. The approach generates realistic and coherent dance motion conditioned on both music and text, while keeping comparable performance conditioned on two single modalities.

[### E2b (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b?utm_source=tldrai)

E2b is an open-source IDE powered by AI agents that do the work for you.

[### Samsung workers made a major error by using ChatGPT (2 minute read)](https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-workers-leaked-company-secrets-by-using-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrai)

Samsung employees accidentally leaked sensitive data while using ChatGPT for assistance with tasks. In less than a month, three incidents of confidential information leaks occurred, with data now retained by OpenAI, ChatGPT's developer. In response, Samsung Semiconductor is creating its own in-house AI for employees with limited prompts, while Samsung Electronics has warned workers about the potential dangers of such data leaks.
