### Headlines & Launches

[### Cursor's $200 Ultra Plan (3 minute read)](https://www.cursor.com/en/blog/new-tier?utm_source=tldrai)

Anysphere has introduced a fixed‚Äëprice Ultra tier that offers far higher compute than Pro, made possible by long‚Äëterm deals with major model vendors.

[### Gemini 2.5 Updated Availability (5 minute read)](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-thinking-model-updates/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google released Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash to general availability, debuted Flash‚ÄëLite in preview, and introduced controllable ‚Äúthinking‚Äù budgets that improve reasoning accuracy while giving developers flexibility.

[### Sam Altman's Take on Meta's $100M Offers (37 minute video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZUG0pr5hBo&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

In a podcast, the OpenAI CEO confirmed Meta dangled nine‚Äëfigure packages to lure researchers to its superintelligence team but said virtually none defected, taking the opportunity to jab at Meta's recruiting push.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Understanding and Coding the KV Cache in LLMs (18 minute read)](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/coding-the-kv-cache-in-llms?utm_source=tldrai)

Key-value (KV) caches store intermediate attention computations during LLM inference to avoid redundant calculations. When generating "Time flies fast" token by token, the model normally recomputes attention for "Time" and "flies" at each step, but caching these values delivers 5x speedups. This tutorial progresses from modifying a 124M parameter GPT model with basic cache buffers and position tracking to production-ready optimizations like pre-allocated memory and sliding windows to address the linear memory growth that becomes prohibitive for long sequences.

[### How Not to Lose Your Job to AI (37 minute read)](https://80000hours.org/agi/guide/skills-ai-makes-valuable/?utm_source=tldrai)

This career guide identifies skills that paradoxically become more valuable as automation increases, including AI deployment, leadership, and government relations. It advises knowledge workers to try to leapfrog traditional entry-level positions entirely, advocating for side projects and startup roles as AI hollows out established corporate hierarchies.

[### OpenAI's Practical Guide to Building Agent (48 minute read)](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf?utm_source=tldrai)

This guide emphasizes starting with single agents before multi-agent systems, using manager patterns where one agent coordinates others via tool calls or decentralized handoffs for peer-to-peer task delegation. Key insights include implementing guardrails as layered defenses (LLM-based classifiers, regex filters, and moderation APIs), designing tools for messy long-horizon tasks, and building human-in-the-loop mechanisms triggered by failure thresholds or high-risk actions.

### Engineering & Research

[### How Delve generated $1M in pipeline from just 4 TLDR newsletter ads (Sponsor)](https://advertise.tldr.tech/case-studies/delve-drives-1m-in-attributed-pipeline-52x-roi-through-tldr-ads/?utm_source=tldrai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=secondary06182025)

Delve ran 4 placements across 2 TLDR newsletters and brought in 66 leads, with a meaningful chunk from enterprise. The result: $1M in attributed pipeline and a 52x ROI.

The case study breaks down their strategy, results, and example ads.

[### Spatiotemporal Attention for MI-EGG Decoding (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/snailpt/TCANet?utm_source=tldrai)

TCANet layers multi‚Äëscale convolutions, temporal compression, and stacked self‚Äëattention to model motor‚Äëimagery EEG.

[### Real-Time Action Chunking with Large Models (12 minute read)](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/research/real_time_chunking?utm_source=tldrai)

Unlike chatbots or image generators, robots must operate in real time - delays between inputs and outputs have a tangible effect on performance. While vision-language-action (VLA) models have achieved promising results in open-world generalization, they can be slow to run. This article presents an algorithm called real-time chunking that enables real-time execution without discontinuities. It works on any diffusion- or flow-based VLA with no training-time changes.

[### MiniMax Releases Open-Weight Reasoning Model M1 (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1?utm_source=tldrai)

MiniMax's 456B parameter model uses a hybrid mixture-of-experts architecture with "lightning attention" that processes 1 million token contexts (8x DeepSeek R1) while using 25% fewer FLOPs at 100K token generation lengths.

### Miscellaneous

[### o3 Turns Pro (22 minute read)](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/o3-turns-pro?utm_source=tldrai)

o3-pro seems to provide better answers than o3, but it has a significantly longer wait time. Using the API at scale seems prohibitively expensive, so users should instead run parallel queries using the chat interface. o3-pro serves the same niche as o3, so users thinking of using Opus may prefer to use Opus rather than, or in addition to, o3-pro. The 80% price cut on o3 seems more impactful than o3-pro - o3-pro is still largely a 'special cases only' model.

[### What We Learned from Briefing 70+ Lawmakers on the Threat from AI (23 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Xwrajm92fdjd7cqnN/what-we-learned-from-briefing-70-lawmakers-on-the-threat?utm_source=tldrai)

Briefings on AI risks revealed most UK parliamentarians lack in-depth AI knowledge and face capacity constraints that limit research on AI issues. The briefings were well-received, with one in three lawmakers publicly supporting AI risk mitigation campaigns. Effective outreach included persistent follow-ups and leveraging statements from notable AI authorities to convey the seriousness of AI-related extinction risks.
