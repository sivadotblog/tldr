### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI and journalism (5 minute read)](https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-journalism?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI addressed The New York Times lawsuit by emphasizing collaboration with news organizations, claiming that AI training with public content is fair use, committing to eliminating rare content regurgitation in their models, and expressing surprise over the lawsuit, given their ongoing efforts to address concerns.

[### Getty And Nvidia Bring Generative AI To Stock Photos (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24027259/getty-images-nvidia-generative-ai-stock-photos?utm_source=tldrai)

Getty Images and Nvidia have enhanced their AI collaboration with the launch of Generative AI by iStock, a platform for creating stock photos tailored for small and medium businesses that uses Nvidia's Picasso model and trained on Getty and iStock libraries.

[### Microsoft Is Adding A Copilot Key To Keyboards (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24023809/microsoft-copilot-key-keyboard-windows-laptops-pcs?utm_source=tldrai)

A new Copilot key, the first big change to the Windows PC keyboard layout in nearly three decades, will ship on a variety of new PCs and laptops from Microsoft‚Äôs partners, providing quick access to Microsoft‚Äôs AI-powered Windows Copilot experience straight from a keyboard button press.

### Research & Innovation

[### DeepSeek Paper (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02954?utm_source=tldrai)

One of the best coding models of last year was the DeepSeek LLM. It got close to GPT-3.5 on many benchmarks (even if it is likely 3x the size). Information about model training, token counts, model architecture, and more has been released in a technical report.

[### Denoising Vision Transformers (31 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02957?utm_source=tldrai)

Vision Transformers (ViT) have taken over the vision community. They still sometimes display grid-like artifacts in their embeddings. This has made the community hesitant to adopt them for downstream tasks. This work proposes an update to the positional embeddings that eliminates this issue and gives a 25%+ boost for downstream vision tasks.

[### 4D Face Video Editing (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02616v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a face video editing architecture that combines GAN-NeRF technology for 3D consistency and a novel stabilizer for smooth temporal coherence. This method excels in editing videos by maintaining consistent views and seamless transitions between frames.

[### The New York Times‚Äôs AI Opportunity (15 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2024/the-new-york-times-ai-opportunity/?utm_source=tldrai)

The New York Times' lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft claims that their AI technologies, including ChatGPT, were trained using millions of the newspaper's copyrighted articles, leading to AI-generated outputs that compete directly with the Times' services. The lawsuit seeks billions in damages and the destruction of AI models and data that used the Times' content, arguing that this constitutes copyright infringement and undermines the newspaper's investment in journalism, raising significant questions about the legalities of AI training practices and the impact of AI on traditional content creators.
