### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI completes restructure, solidifying Microsoft as a major shareholder (4 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/open-ai-for-profit-microsoft.html?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has restructured into a non-profit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business. The nonprofit is called the OpenAI Foundation. It holds a 26% stake in the for-profit arm. The for-profit arm is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC. Microsoft holds an investment in the PBC that is roughly 27% of the company. Microsoft can now pursue AGI independently or in collaboration with third parties, and OpenAI can now jointly develop some products with third parties.

[### PayPal signs deal with OpenAI to become the first payments wallet in ChatGPT (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/paypal-openai-chatgpt-payments-deal.html?utm_source=tldrai)

PayPal's digital wallet will be embedded into ChatGPT so users can pay for items through the chatbot starting next year. The deal will also allow merchants to sell items on the platform. The move is an early part of OpenAI's efforts to broaden ChatGPT's use for e-commerce. The company believes its 700 million-plus weekly users will use the service to find items, similar to a human personal shopper. PayPal is attempting to position itself as a payments backbone for the upcoming era of agentic AI shopping.

[### OpenAI offers free ChatGPT Go for one year to all users in India (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-offers-free-chatgpt-go-for-one-year-to-all-users-in-india/?utm_source=tldrai)

India is OpenAI's second-largest market with 29 million downloads in 90 days, but accounts for only $3.6 million in revenue. Perplexity and Google have also deployed aggressive free-tier strategies to capture the country's 700 million smartphone users to generate advertising revenue.

[### Peter Thiel-Backed Startup Secures $100 Million to Make Chips in US (8 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/peter-thiel-backed-startup-secures-100-million-to-make-chips-in-u-s-baff93ac?st=tbJPEu&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrai)

Substrate, a San Francisco-based startup founded by a protege of investor Peter Thiel, claims it has reinvented a key link in the microchip production process. It plans to use its innovation to build manufacturing facilities in the US. The startup has targeted a three-year timeframe for producing its first chips. Industry analysts say the high costs and enormous technical challenges in lithography give ASML, the sole global manufacturer of advanced lithography machines, a 10-year head start over any would-be competitors.

[### Meta's $75B AI Infrastructure Bet: Inside the Biggest Cloud Deals of 2025 (13 minute read)](https://allenarch.dev/blog/meta-75b-ai-infrastructure-bet/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta's capital expenditure ratio hit 37% of revenue in Q3 2025, the highest capex-to-revenue ratio in the company's history. It announced $75.5 billion in infrastructure deals between September and October. Meta is financing the infrastructure for superintelligent AI systems. Meta can't compete with OpenAI on model quality alone - it needs a lot of dedicated compute, exclusive access to the latest Nvidia chips, and a vertically integrated stack to iterate faster, train bigger models, and serve more users. If AI doesn't deliver a return on Meta's investment, Meta will still have to pay rent for the next 16 years.

[### Trump-Xi Trade Talks May Include Easing AI Chip Restrictions (3 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1982859134530937049.html?utm_source=tldrai)

A forthcoming Nvidia chip would level the playing field between Chinese and US AI labs, which Trump may use as leverage over Xi in wide-ranging trade talks. The move would shrink America's massive AI compute advantage dramatically, especially since China's domestic alternatives are still far behind the US. Export restrictions are the only way to maintain the compute gap.
