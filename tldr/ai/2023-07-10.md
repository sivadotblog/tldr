### Headlines & Launches

[### Google‚Äôs medical AI chatbot is already being tested in hospitals (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/8/23788265/google-med-palm-2-mayo-clinic-chatbot-bard-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrai)

Google is testing its AI tool, Med-PaLM 2, designed to answer medical information queries, at Mayo Clinic. A variant of the language model PaLM 2, Med-PaLM 2 has shown promising results in reasoning, consensus-supported answers, and comprehension, albeit with some accuracy issues. Google claims that customer data during the test phase will remain encrypted and out of its access, underscoring privacy measures.

[### Alibaba Unveils AI Image Generator (1 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/07/alibaba-launches-ai-tool-to-generate-images-from-text-.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Chinese technology giant Alibaba launched an artificial intelligence tool that can generate images from prompts on Friday.

[### The US Military Is Taking Generative AI Out for a Spin (4 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-05/the-us-military-is-taking-generative-ai-out-for-a-spin?utm_source=tldrai)

The US Defense Department is successfully testing LLMs for military tasks, aiming to speed up data requests and generate novel solutions. The Pentagon, in collaboration with tech startups like Scale AI, is experimenting with five LLMs as part of their broader data integration and digital platforms development efforts across the military.

### Research & Innovation

[### MoEs may be easier to instruction tune (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14705?utm_source=tldrai)

Mixtures of Experts are sparse models that have the same inference cost as dense models. They have been used in production situations for a number of years. It turns out that they may be easier to instruction tune than their dense counterparts. This is important because instruction tuning has been shown to be invaluable in modern language models.

[### Inverse RL without the RL is fast and robust (4 minute read)](https://gokul.dev/filter/?utm_source=tldrai)

Inverse reinforcement learning is sometimes called behavior cloning or expert imitation. It makes the easy task of supervised tuning hard by introducing an inner reinforcement learning loop. However, if we remove that loop, we get many of the benefits of reinforcement learning exploration without some of the challenges of the function approximation issue.

[### Large language models can do limited counterfactual reasoning (31 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02477?utm_source=tldrai)

There's been a lot of discussion recently about how to evaluate language model performance. Benchmarks are good and give directional metrics of improvement. However, they are well known to be incomplete. This paper explores counterfactual reasoning and suggests that models are not as powerful as we believe, but are more powerful than recent baseline models.

[### How Christopher Nolan Learned To Love AI (10 minute read)](https://archive.ph/YYBtI?utm_source=tldrai)

In an interview with Wired, Christopher Nolan discussed his upcoming film Oppenheimer, which is about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons. Nolan said that he is interested in exploring the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and that he believes that Oppenheimer's story is a cautionary tale about the misuse of technology.
