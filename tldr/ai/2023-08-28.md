### Headlines & Launches

[### AI bots are so good at mimicking the human brain and vision that CAPTCHAs are useless (3 minute read)](https://qz.com/ai-bots-recaptcha-turing-test-websites-authenticity-1850734350?utm_source=tldrai)

Recent research revealed that AI bots decode CAPTCHAs faster and more accurately than humans. The study challenges the effectiveness of CAPTCHAs in the age of advancing AI.

[### Fine-tuned Llama code model beats GPT-4 on code benchmark (1 minute read)](https://www.phind.com/blog/code-llama-beats-gpt4?utm_source=tldrai)

Companies with stores of high quality internal data have released fine-tuned versions of Llama that are extremely adept at code just days after Meta released its new programming language models. It is important to note that the current version of GPT-4 is still better than any open-source model at coding. This article compares the new Llama models with the March version of GPT-4.

[### Photorealistic Unreal Graphics (PUG) from Meta (5 minute read)](https://pug.metademolab.com/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta AI has unveiled a series of datasets that harness the power of Unreal Engine for photorealistic imagery. The released datasets include PUG: Animals for foundation model research, PUG: ImageNet to assess image classifier robustness, and PUG: SPAR for vision-language model evaluation.

### Research & Innovation

[### A Better Test for Detecting Bias in LLMs (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12539v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a new test called CALM to check if AI language tools are biased. After collecting a lot of data from different sources and testing various AI models, they found that some big AI models can be more biased than smaller ones.

[### FineRecon: Depth-aware Feed-forward Network for Detailed 3D Reconstruction (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01480?utm_source=tldrai)

New research from Apple shows amazing performance on the challenging problem of 3D object reconstruction.

[### A Dynamic Network for Sharper Image Fusion (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12538v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Scientists have designed a new system called MGDN that merges multiple images into one clear picture, fixing the issues older methods had in using varying images. The special tools inside MGDN help in understanding the different parts of images better and blending them smoothly.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Enhancing Detecting of Human-Object Interactions (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06202v1?utm_source=tldrai)

While the DETR framework is popular for human-object interaction (HOI) research, current two-stage transformers overlook critical contextual details, like pose and orientation, leading to issues in identifying complex interactions. Enhanced predicate visual context (PViC) improves HOI recognition by better integrating image features and spatial information.

[### Apple's ultra fast ViT (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/apple/ml-fastvit?utm_source=tldrai)

Running at less than 1 ms latency, this super fast vision transformer from Apple is a case study in edge deployment.

[### Train long context models with deep speed (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/tree/master/blogs/deepspeed-ulysses?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepSpeed is a library from Microsoft that can be used to scale up language models pre-training. It is somewhat complicated to use, but it provides powerful abstractions. Microsoft recently added sequence parallelism to train models with longer context lengths. It isn't a novel breakthrough, but rather an engineering win for the open-source community.

### Miscellaneous

[### Code models lose language skills, but we can fix it (7 minute read)](https://github.com/OpenLemur/Lemur?utm_source=tldrai)

The reason closed source models like Claude or GPT-4 are so impressive is because they are incredibly good at reasoning AND have general purpose language ability. Many open alternatives focus on an extremely narrow niche of skills and neglect others. The OpenLemur project aims to balance language model skills across many different tasks similar to closed models.

[### An Interview with Marc Andreessen about AI and How You Change the World (25 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2023/an-interview-with-marc-andreessen-about-ai-and-how-you-change-the-world/?utm_source=tldrai)

AI will create major economic benefits and improvements in human life, countering "hysterical freakout" about existential threats. The risks of general AI taking over are overblown since it lacks evolutionary drives. We should take an engineering approach of incremental progress.

[### Another even better open-source code model (6 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-Python-34B-V1.0?utm_source=tldrai)

The WizardLM folks have used their Evol instruct technique to dramatically improve Llama code performance - they even beat the Phind model. These results are slightly suspect because they generate instructions that directly improve their evaluation scores, instead of using a fixed dataset and also treating evaluation as fixed. This may not be an issue, but it breaks machine learning best practices and so it's hard to know what the full general capabilities are.
