Bad actors use AI to test stolen credentials across thousands of sites. They share attack patterns in real-time and automate everything.

Meanwhile, many fraud-prevention teams are still working in silos and are bogged down by manual processes.

The new [playbook by Javelin and Plaid](https://plaid.com/javelin-identity-fraud-whitepaper/?utm_source=TLDRAI&utm_medium=PaidNewsletter&utm_campaign=TLDRAI_Paid_Newsletter_Ad_Buy&utm_content=Javelin_Identity_Fraud_Report) looks at how companies can close the gap with modern fraudsters, while making life easier for honest users:

### Headlines & Launches

[### Apple working on MCP support to enable agentic AI on Mac, iPhone, and iPad (4 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/22/macos-tahoe-26-1-beta-1-mcp-integration/?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple has begun to lay the groundwork for adopting Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) in its latest round of betas. MCP allows AI agents to interface with traditional platforms. The standard has been widely adopted and has become a universal pathway for AI assistants to plug into APIs and data sources. Apple plans to let developers use a system-level MCP integration to expose actions and functionalities within apps to AI platforms and agents.

[### OpenAI Unveils Plans for Seemingly Limitless Expansion of Computing Power (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/openai-unveils-plans-for-seemingly-limitless-expansion-of-computing-power-d0b39b9b?st=BRxrXP&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has laid out its vision for a $1 trillion build-out of computing warehouses across the US and abroad. It announced five new datacenter sites across the US, built with Oracle and SoftBank, which together will bring online nearly 7 gigawatts of power. The company envisions that it will need more than 20 gigawatts of computing capacity to meet demand for ChatGPT. Each gigawatt is expected to cost roughly $50 billion.

[### Getting AI to Work in Complex Codebases (23 minute read)](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md?utm_source=tldrai)

AI coding agents are great for new projects or small changes, but they often make developers less productive in large, established codebases. This post discusses a family of techniques called 'frequent intention compaction' that involves deliberately structuring how context is fed to AI throughout the development process to improve performance on large codebases. The technique has allowed a team to use AI to handle Rust codebases with 300,000 lines of code, ship a week's worth of work in a day, and maintain code quality that passes expert review. It shows how AI for coding is actually a deeply technical engineering craft.

[### Sampling and structured outputs in LLMs (10 minute read)](https://parthsareen.com/blog.html#sampling.md?utm_source=tldrai)

Sampling is the process of selecting a token from a model's vocabulary based on the probability distribution. Structured outputs allow models to turn unstructured data into structured data. Together, they both determine a model's next chosen token. Large language models are extremely sensitive to the slightest variation in their system prompts, templating, structured outputs, and sampling parameters.

[### Microsoft looks to build AI marketplace for publishers (3 minute read)](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/23/microsoft-ai-marketplace-publishers?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft's Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM) will launch as a pilot program with a limited set of publishers. The company's Copilot assistant will be the first AI buyer on the marketplace. Most AI companies have focused on brokering licensing deals that pay publishers upfront for access to content rather than on a per-use basis. PCM will help Microsoft deepen its relationship with publishers as it expands its AI capabilities and restructures its relationship with OpenAI.
