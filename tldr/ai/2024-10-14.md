[### Silicon Valley is debating if AI weapons should be allowed to decide to kill (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/11/silicon-valley-is-debating-if-ai-weapons-should-be-allowed-to-decide-to-kill/?utm_source=tldrai)

Debate over fully autonomous weapons continues as Anduril's Palmer Luckey expresses openness to them, contrasting with Shield AI's previous stance against AI making lethal decisions. The U.S. government remains non-committal, with no binding ban on such weapons, amidst fears that adversaries like China or Russia might develop them first. Defense tech companies, including Anduril and Palantir, are lobbying heavily to influence policy on the integration of AI in military systems.

[### Burn the Playbooks (9 minute read)](https://www.notboring.co/p/burn-the-playbooks?utm_source=tldrai)

AI excels at following defined rulesets, making it particularly effective for tasks like automating tax processes. Playbook-driven success limits human creativity, which AI can already surpass in formulaic tasks such as math tests and coding. By relying heavily on playbooks, we risk diminishing our unique human creativity and becoming more machine-like, reinforcing AI's strengths over ours.
