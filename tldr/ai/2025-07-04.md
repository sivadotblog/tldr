[### Ilya Sutskever becomes CEO of Safe Superintelligence after Meta poached Daniel Gross (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/03/ilya-sutskever-is-ceo-of-safe-superintelligence-after-meta-hired-gross.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI co-founder, has become the CEO of Safe Superintelligence after Meta hired former CEO Daniel Gross. Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, will continue its AI expansion with significant investments and the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs. Sutskever will commit to maintaining Safe Superintelligence as an independent entity, dismissing acquisition attempts by Meta.

[### Meta is reportedly training its AI chatbots to send unprompted messages (3 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-reportedly-training-its-ai-chatbots-to-send-unprompted-messages-143229039.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta's AI chatbots, developed with its no-code AI Studio, are being trained to send unprompted follow-up messages, enhancing user retention and engagement. The project, internally called "Project Omni," allows users to customize chatbot appearances and content across Meta platforms. While designed to boost engagement and revenue, these proactive messages will only occur if initiated by the user and adhere to established conversational guidelines.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Coding Agents 101: The Art of Actually Getting Things Done (15 minute read)](https://devin.ai/agents101#introduction?utm_source=tldrai)

The Devin creators advocate "defensive prompting" - explicitly telling agents HOW to approach tasks, not just what to build - while noting 1-6 hour tasks offer the highest ROI. They observe that senior-to-staff engineers adopt AI tools the fastest because they understand how to architect tasks for junior employees.

[### Context Engineering for Agents (11 minute read)](https://blog.langchain.com/context-engineering-for-agents/?utm_source=tldrai)

LangChain shares a detailed guide on ‚ÄúContext Engineering,‚Äù a key part of agent building, including popular patterns and how to implement them

[### The End of Moore's Law for AI? Gemini Flash Offers a Warning (13 minute read)](https://sutro.sh/blog/the-end-of-moore-s-law-for-ai-gemini-flash-offers-a-warning?utm_source=tldrai)

The AI industry has operated under its own version of Moore's Law over the past few years with an unwavering belief that the cost of intelligence would perpetually decrease by orders of magnitude each year. Each new model generation was not only more capable, but also cheaper to run. Google broke that trend last week with the introduction of Gemini 2.5 Flash. The input token price for the model doubled while the output price more than quadrupled. This is the first time a major provider has backtracked on the price of an established model, and it may signal a turning point - the industry may no longer be on an endless downward slide of cost.

### Engineering & Research

[### Open Source RL Libraries for LLMs (16 minute read)](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/open-source-rl-libraries-for-llms?utm_source=tldrai)

Anyscale researchers compare TRL, Verl, OpenRLHF, and six other frameworks across adoption metrics, system properties, and technical architecture to help developers choose the right tool for RLHF, reasoning models, or agentic training scenarios.

[### Inference-Time Scaling and Collective Intelligence for Frontier AI (12 minute read)](https://sakana.ai/ab-mcts/?utm_source=tldrai)

The new inference-time scaling method combines o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and DeepSeek-R1 to achieve 30% on ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, outperforming individual models by dynamically selecting which AI handles each problem. The approach extends Monte Carlo Tree Search to balance generating new solutions versus refining existing ones, with the open-source TreeQuest framework enabling practical deployment.

[### Applying RL: Improving Code Merging (3 minute read)](https://osmosis.ai/blog/code-merge-release?utm_source=tldrai)

Osmosis-Apply-1.7B, a fine-tuned version of Qwen3-1.7B using reinforcement learning, outperforms larger foundation models like OpenAI o3 in code merging tasks with a reward score of 0.9893 and at a significantly lower cost. Trained on a subset of the CommitPackFT dataset, its efficiency stems from using GRPO with FSDP strategy, optimizing for successful code merges without KL divergence or entropy bonuses.

[### ChatGPT referrals to news sites are growing, but not enough to offset search declines (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/chatgpt-referrals-to-news-sites-are-growing-but-not-enough-to-offset-search-declines/?utm_source=tldrai)

Users are increasingly getting their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results. The number of news searches on the web that resulted in no click-throughs since the launch of Google's AI Overviews has grown from 56% to nearly 69% as of May this year. News-related prompts in ChatGPT grew by 212% from January 2024 through May 2025. Visibility in Google Search results and good SEO practices may no longer deliver the value they did before AI.
