### Miscellaneous

[### How does ChatGPT work? As explained by the ChatGPT team (6 minute read)](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/?utm_source=tldrai)

In this article, OpenAI's Evan Morikawa provides insights into ChatGPT's inner workings, covering input text processing and tokenization to prediction sampling using large language models. ChatGPT operates by turning tokens into numerical vectors (embeddings), multiplying them by a weight matrix of billions, and selecting the most probable next word. The tech is grounded in extensive pretraining to predict text based on vast internet data.

[### Self-Reasoning Tokens, teaching models to think ahead (4 minute read)](https://reasoning-tokens.ghost.io/reasoning-tokens/?utm_source=tldrai)

Recent experiments introduced "Reasoning Tokens" to improve the thinking process of language models like GPT-2, encouraging them to make calculations for future tokens. Early results show a 35% decrease in loss, indicating the models can indeed learn to anticipate future information. This approach could enhance the ability of language models to plan and reason in a self-supervised manner, potentially reducing the need for step-by-step explanations.

[### Los Angeles is using AI in a pilot program to try to predict homelessness and allocate aid (7 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/19/los-angeles-is-using-an-ai-pilot-program-to-try-to-predict-homelessness.html?utm_source=tldrai)

The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services is using predictive AI to prevent homelessness, identifying at-risk individuals to provide aid and successfully keeping 86% of participants housed. The program, initiated in 2021, has assisted nearly 800 households with over $4,000 in support each. Despite concerns over privacy and ethics, the AI initiative shows promise in addressing California's climbing homelessness crisis.
