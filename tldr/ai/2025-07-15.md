Baseten recently outlined their multi-cloud capacity management (MCM) infrastructure for generative AI workloads. Baseten's MCM unifies 10+ clouds into a global GPU pool enabling infinite scaling and 99.99% uptime for generative AI workloads.

What that means for you:

* üòé Don't go down when a single cloud does
* üåé Horizontally scale across cloud providers
* üìà Seamlessly scale up during peak demand (even with virality)
* ‚úÖ No downtime for your end users due to infra challenges
* üöï On demand compute, pay only for what you use

[### Meta Weighing Shift Away from Open Source (4 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-superintelligence-lab-ai.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Wk8.OcqB.PxMXKAOg8pHX&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrai)

The newly formed superintelligence lab is considering abandoning its flagship open-source Behemoth model in favor of closed development, marking a potential philosophical shift from the company's long-standing commitment to open AI.

[### Cognition acquires Windsurf (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/cognition-maker-of-the-ai-coding-agent-devin-acquires-windsurf/?utm_source=tldrai)

Cognition scooped up Windsurf's remaining 250-person team and $82 million ARR business after Google's $2.4 billion reverse-acquihire cherry-picked only the leadership, leaving employees behind without payouts. The acquisition gives Cognition both AI coding agents and IDE capabilities to compete with Cursor's $500 million ARR, and restores Windsurf's access to Claude models that Anthropic had cut off amid rumors of an OpenAI acquisition.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### LLM Daydreaming (10 minute read)](https://gwern.net/ai-daydreaming?utm_source=tldrai)

LLMs don't have background processes that allow the model to form connections between seemingly unrelated topics similar to how humans make new realizations while "daydreaming." This is the reason AIs have yet to make any new discoveries. This post proposes a remedy: a system that would prompt LLMs to randomly retrieve facts, generate novel connections between them, then use a critic model to filter for genuinely valuable insights.

[### Did Windsurf Sell Too Cheap? The Wild 72-Hour Saga and AI Coding Valuations (6 minute read)](https://www.saastr.com/did-windsurf-sell-too-cheap-the-wild-72-hour-saga-and-ai-coding-valuations/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google acquired key members of Windsurf for $2.4 billion after OpenAI's $3 billion offer expired, while Cognition took over the remaining company. Despite Windsurf's impressive $82 million ARR and rapid growth, the loss of Anthropic API access and leadership exits weakened its market position. The AI coding industry's inflated valuations, driven by talent wars and platform dependencies, suggest Windsurf's sale price may have been below its potential value.

[### Energy-Based Transformers are Scalable Learners and Thinkers (32 minute read)](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02092?utm_source=tldrai)

Energy-Based Transformers replace direct prediction with learned verification functions that assign compatibility scores between inputs and candidate outputs. The architecture is first to out-scale standard Transformers as it allows models to dynamically allocate computation and self-verify predictions without external supervision, achieving up to 35% higher scaling rates.

[### AWS previews Kiro IDE for developers who are over vibe coding (2 minute read)](https://kiro.dev/faq/?utm_source=tldrai)

Kiro is a Claude-powered "agentic IDE" that addresses the quality problems of AI-generated code by first producing specifications and user stories before generating actual code. The tool aims to move beyond "vibe coding" and reduce the time developers spend debugging and reviewing AI-generated code.
