üëã Say hi to Bland, the [world's most realistic AI phone-calling agent.](https://www.bland.ai/?utm_campaign=TLDRAIAug&utm_medium=paid&utm_source=TLDRhome)

Chances are, you've already spoken to it without even noticing... It can:

üó£Ô∏è Respond in any voice or language.

ü¶æ It's already handling 1M+ phone calls simultaneously - 24/7 - for some of the world's largest businesses.

For [enterprises](https://app.bland.ai/enterprise?utm_campaign=TLDRAIAug&utm_medium=paid&utm_source=TLDRForm), it's been a financial game changer across sales, operations, customer support, you name it. It's like the perfect employee.

Pretty wild, huh? Here, [give it a call yourself.](https://www.bland.ai/?utm_campaign=TLDRAIAug&utm_medium=paid&utm_source=TLDRhome)

### Research & Innovation

[### Fire-Flyer AI HPC (34 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14158?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepSeek has released a paper outlining its hardware-software co-design strategy for DL training.

[### Physics of Language Models: Part 3.3 (27 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05405?utm_source=tldrai)

The 3rd part of a series, this paper explores scaling laws and how many bits are required to store knowledge in a model. The answer seems to be around 2 bits of knowledge per parameter.

[### Announcing Higgs Llama V2 (2 minute read)](https://boson.ai/higgs-v2/?utm_source=tldrai)

Boson AI has introduced Higgs-Llama-3-70B-v2, a new model that excels in dialog and comprehension benchmarks like Arena-Hard and AlpacaEval 2.0. The model reduces response regeneration rates by 21.6% and boosts day 1 retention by 5.3% compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Enhanced by an in-house reward model, Higgs Judger, it ties with Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro on performance.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Keyword search is a dud (Sponsor)](https://www.ask-ai.com/lp/help-center-tldr?utm_source=tldrai)

Customers don't always use the words you expect them to, which tends to break keyword-based solutions for knowledge base and in-product search. Luckily, genAI does much better. Make your help center actually helpful with [Ask AI's Generative Search](https://www.ask-ai.com/lp/help-center-tldr). Minutes to deploy, no developer needed.

[### Hybrid Model post training cookbook (25 minute read)](https://www.zyphra.com/post/the-zyphra-training-cookbook?utm_source=tldrai)

Pre-training hybrid (Mamba style) models is different from pre-training normal Transformers. This post explores how to scale different hyperparameters, data acquisition, and others to get the performance you want.

[### Llama Duo: System for model fallback (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/deep-diver/llamaduo?utm_source=tldrai)

This is a framework that fine-tunes small models to serve as a fallback when closed API models go down. It shows how to migrate from a large to a small model smoothly.

[### LitServe (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/LitServe?utm_source=tldrai)

LitServe is an easy-to-use, flexible serving engine for AI models built on FastAPI. Features like batching, streaming, and GPU autoscaling eliminate the need to rebuild a FastAPI server per model.

### Miscellaneous

[### Memory-Efficient LLM Training (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12857v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Online Subspace Descent is a new optimizer that improves the training of LLMs by enhancing memory efficiency.

[### Inference Is FREE And INSTANT (4 minute read)](https://fume.substack.com/p/inference-is-free-and-instant?utm_source=tldrai)

While large language models (LLMs) may not significantly improve in reasoning capabilities, their decreasing costs and increasing speeds will make them more useful for repetitive tasks. Although these models may lack true understanding, they can still efficiently handle straightforward tasks.

[### Llava BitNet (Hugging Face Hub)](https://huggingface.co/IntelLabs/LlavaOLMoBitnet1B?utm_source=tldrai)

Llava BitNet is the first ternary (-1, 0, 1) weight model trained on VLM tasks. The model, weights, and scripts are in the process of being fully open sourced. The technical report will be released soon and suggests the model has promising performance.
