[### Slow models = dead products ☠️ Get faster inference with Baseten (Sponsor)](https://www.baseten.co/?utm_source=newsletter_tldr_ai&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=2024_10_17_tldr_ai)

15 years ago, Amazon found that every 100 milliseconds of latency cost 1% of revenue. Today, 100 ms kills entire products.

That's why startups building real AI-native applications (not GPT wrappers) turn to Baseten for applied performance research, distributed GPU infrastructure, and hands-on support.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Turn Ideas Into Flask Apps with No-Code (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/ditto?utm_source=tldrai)

Ditto is a no-code tool that transforms natural language descriptions into multi-file Flask applications. It automates much of the coding process using a simple LLM loop, helping users create functional web apps from their ideas.

[### Text-to-Speech System (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/lucasnewman/f5-tts-mlx?utm_source=tldrai)

F5-TTS is a non-autoregressive, zero-shot text-to-speech system that uses a flow-matching mel spectrogram generator and a diffusion transformer. Built on the MLX framework, F5 improves on previous systems like E2 TTS by using ConvNeXT v2 blocks for better text alignment, producing high-quality speech in around 11 seconds on modern hardware.

[### Long-Context Handling for LLMs (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/duo-attention?utm_source=tldrai)

DuoAttention is a framework designed to reduce memory and latency in long-context LLMs by selectively applying full KV caching to only essential attention heads.
