### Research & Innovation

[### ConvFormer: An Efficient Approach for Image Super-Resolution (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05633v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper Introduces ConvFormer, a novel Convolutional Transformer layer designed for lightweight image super-resolution tasks. This new technique effectively replaces self-attention modules with large kernel convolutions, allowing for efficient modeling of long-range dependencies with minimal computational costs.

[### Enhancing Search Skills of LLMs (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06532v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed INTERS, a new dataset designed to improve how large language models like LLaMA and Mistral handle information retrieval tasks.

[### Efficient Biomedical Image Segmentation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/liuxy1103/grdbis?utm_source=tldrai)

A new graph relation distillation technique improves instance segmentation. This method efficiently transfers knowledge from larger, complex networks to smaller, high-performing ones, focusing on three key areas: instance features, their relationships, and pixel-level boundaries.
