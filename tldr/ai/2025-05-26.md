[### Nvidia to launch cheaper Blackwell AI chip for China after US export curbs, sources say (3 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-launch-cheaper-blackwell-ai-chip-china-after-us-export-curbs-sources-say-2025-05-24/?utm_source=tldrai)

Nvidia plans to launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model. The company has scheduled mass production to begin as early as June. The new chips will be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000 to $12,000 the H20 sold for. The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.

[### Infinite tool use (12 minute read)](https://snimu.github.io/2025/05/23/infinite-tool-use.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Large language models should never output anything but tool calls and their arguments. Exclusively working through tools allows models to externalize large parts of their intelligence to more efficient domain-specific programs. Some developers are already switching to a tool-use paradigm, but this is still limited to very short contexts and to only parts of the model output. This post provides examples of how the tool-use paradigm benefits different domains, like text editing, video understanding, and 3D generation.

[### GenAI's adoption puzzle (3 minute read)](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2025/5/25/genais-adoption-puzzle?utm_source=tldrai)

ChatGPT usage grew amazingly fast - much faster than PCs, the web, or smartphones. However, it was just a website - people didn't need to go buy a new device or wait for infrastructure to be deployed. Despite its advantages, ChatGPT's daily active users to weekly active users ratio is pretty bad. This may fix itself over time as models mature and more use cases emerge. The chatbot interface might only be working for some people and some use cases, so it might be better to wrap features and capabilities inside other things.
