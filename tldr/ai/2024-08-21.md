[### OpenAI Strikes Search Deal With Conde Nast (2 minute read)](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/20/openai-conde-nast-deal-chatgpt-search?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has entered a multi-year licensing agreement with Cond√© Nast, allowing it to display content from the publisher's brands, such as Vogue and The New Yorker, within its products, including ChatGPT and SearchGPT.

[### Fine-Tuning Now Available For GPT-4o (4 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-fine-tuning/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has launched fine-tuning for GPT-4o, allowing developers to customize the model for specific use cases with their own datasets. It is offering 1 million free training tokens per day through September 23.

[### Meta's Self-Taught Evaluator enables LLMs to create their own training data (4 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/metas-self-taught-evaluator-enables-llms-to-create-their-own-training-data/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta FAIR researchers have introduced the Self-Taught Evaluator, a method to train evaluative LLMs without human annotations, potentially enhancing the efficiency and scalability of LLM assessment. Using the LLM-as-a-Judge concept, it iteratively generates and refines responses to create a training dataset, demonstrating improved performance on benchmarks like RewardBench. This technique could enable enterprises to leverage unlabeled data for LLM tuning while acknowledging the importance of a well-aligned seed model and the limitations of benchmarks.

### Miscellaneous

[### AI Companies Are Pivoting From Creating Gods To Building Products (10 minute read)](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-companies-are-pivoting-from-creating?utm_source=tldrai)

AI companies have overestimated the readiness of generative AI for widespread commercial use, leading to costly missteps in product development and market integration. As they try to correct course, they must overcome five key challenges: ensuring cost-effectiveness, improving reliability, safeguarding privacy, enhancing safety and security, and refining user interfaces. These obstacles highlight the gap between AI's potential capabilities and the practical realities of deploying AI systems that meet consumer expectations and integrate seamlessly into existing workflows. The path to widespread adoption will likely unfold over a decade or more, rather than the rapid timeline some have predicted.

[### Why Diffusion could help LLMs reason (26 minute read)](https://ai.gopubby.com/think-before-you-speak-5611bcbbbd4c?utm_source=tldrai)

Current language models predict one word at a time, which gives very little room for planning and reasoning. There are ways around this such as Chain of Thought prompting. However, potentially using diffusion models, which can spend more diffusion steps per token, could be a way to improve model reasoning.
