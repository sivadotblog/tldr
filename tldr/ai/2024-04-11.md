[### 3D Asset Creation with DreamView (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06119v1?utm_source=tldrai)

DreamView introduces an innovative approach to creating 3D objects from text descriptions that allows for detailed customization from multiple viewpoints while ensuring the object remains consistent overall.

[### Measuring Large Model Persuasiveness (12 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/measuring-model-persuasiveness?utm_source=tldrai)

In a study examining persuasiveness, the Claude 3 Opus AI model was found to closely match human persuasiveness. This was determined through statistical tests and adjustments for multiple comparisons. Humans were slightly more persuasive, but not by a statistically significant margin, underscoring a trend where larger, more sophisticated models are becoming more convincing. Claude 3 Opus emerged as the top model in terms of persuasiveness. A control condition confirmed the study's methodological reliability by showing expectedly negligible persuasiveness for indisputable facts.
