### Headlines & Launches

[### Mistral x Snowflake (3 minute read)](https://www.snowflake.com/news/snowflake-partners-with-mistral-ai-to-bring-industry-leading-language-models-to-enterprises-through-snowflake-cortex/?utm_source=tldrai)

Mistral and Snowflake have partnered to bring Mistral Large to Snowflake Cortex customers.

[### Moondream 2 small vision language model (4 minute read)](https://moondream.ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Moondream is a small Phi-2 and SigLIP-based language model. This second version is commercially licensed and has significantly improved benchmark performance. It is ideal for running on low compute devices and describing images.

[### Driverless startup Waymo to test self-driving vehicles with no human driver in Austin (3 minute read)](https://www.statesman.com/story/business/technology/2024/03/05/waymo-to-test-self-driving-vehicles-without-human-driver-in-austin/72855110007/?utm_source=tldrai)

Waymo is starting tests of its fifth-generation driverless Jaguar I-Pace in Austin as it advances towards launching a ride-hail service. Initially, rides will be for Waymo employees, with plans to open to the public later. Waymo's expansion in Austin contributes to its roadmap of providing autonomous vehicle services in multiple cities.

### Research & Innovation

[### MathScale: Scaling Instruction Tuning for Mathematical Reasoning (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02884?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers used synthetic data to generate 2 million path problems. They then trained a 7B model and found strong performance against state-of-the-art large language models.

[### Design2Code: How Far Are We From Automating Front-End Engineering? (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03163?utm_source=tldrai)

Taking images of a design and outputting code is a challenging task. This work proposes a benchmark, 18B model, and evaluations to suggest that we are close to being able to perform this on simple designs. In some cases, GPT-4V-generated code is preferred over human-synthesized code.

[### Making AI to Plan and Execute Complex Tasks (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02782v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The KEPP system introduces a new approach to planning and executing complex tasks. The method, which leverages a probabilistic knowledge graph, allows the model to logically sequence actions towards achieving a goal.

[### HuggingFace text clustering (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/huggingface/text-clustering?utm_source=tldrai)

An open source text clustering tool that allows you to embed, cluster, and semantically label clusters easily and quickly. The entire pipeline runs in 10 minutes on 100k samples.

[### Enhancing LLMs‚Äô Planning Skills (3 minute read)](https://www.zjukg.org/project/KnowAgent/?utm_source=tldrai)

KnowAgent introduces a novel strategy for boosting large language models' planning skills by integrating explicit action knowledge. The approach helps LLMs perform better in complex tasks by guiding them through more logical planning trajectories.

[### MLX Swift Examples (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples?utm_source=tldrai)

MLX is a framework developed by Apple for training AI models on Mac. This repository shows how to train models that can run on mobile devices with Swift. It takes one on an iPhone to train an MNIST classifier model.

[### OpenAI Sora: One Step Away From The Matrix (5 minute read)](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/openai-sora-one-step-away-from-the?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's Sora is a text-to-video model capable of generating high-fidelity videos with diverse aspect ratios and resolutions that also exhibits world simulation abilities. Sora‚Äôs vast capabilities raises both excitement and concerns about the implications for reality simulation and AGI.

[### We Need Self-Driving Cars (4 minute read)](https://www.newcomer.co/p/we-need-self-driving-cars?utm_source=tldrai)

A Waymo self-driving car was vandalized and set on fire in San Francisco, an act seen by some as a protest against the imposition of autonomous vehicles. Such hostility overlooks the potential for self-driving cars to drastically reduce traffic fatalities. As the technology improves, autonomous vehicles will enhance safety and complement public transport.

[### Subprime Intelligence (15 minute read)](https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-altman-fried/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's Sora exhibits significant flaws, revealing the limitations of generative AI's understanding. The technology's potential impact on the creative industry and its heavy computational demands highlight both its revolutionary capabilities and practical challenges.
