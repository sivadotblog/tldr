PixelFlow models generate images directly in pixel space without VAEs, offering strong image quality and semantic control with competitive efficiency and benchmark results.

[### Painting With Concepts Using Diffusion Model Latents (11 minute read)](https://www.goodfire.ai/blog/painting-with-concepts?utm_source=tldrai)

Goodfire's Paint With Ember is a tool that lets users directly manipulate the neural activations of image models by painting simple pixel images instead of using text prompts. The tool uses sparse autoencoders to decode Stable Diffusion XL-Turbo's internal features into interpretable visual concepts, allowing direct access to the model's "brain."

[### Random Rewards During RL Boost Math Reasoning in Some LLMs (21 minute read)](https://rethink-rlvr.notion.site/Spurious-Rewards-Rethinking-Training-Signals-in-RLVR-1f4df34dac1880948858f95aeb88872f?utm_source=tldrai)

Qwen2.5-Math models achieve 15-24% performance gains using completely spurious rewards like random feedback, incorrect answers, or formatting requirements‚Äînearly matching traditional RL methods. However, this phenomenon was only observed on Qwen models due to their pre-existing code reasoning capabilities, while other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2 show minimal or negative effects.

Dario Amodei predicts AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next five years. He believes AI labs have an obligation to warn the public about the coming "white-collar bloodbath" across tech, finance, law, and consulting.

[### US-China AI Gap: 2025 Analysis of Model Performance, Investment, and Innovation (21 minute read)](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/measuring-the-us-china-ai-gap?utm_source=tldrai)

China aims to lead AI innovation by 2030 but currently lags behind the US in key industry pillars, including funding and technology. While China's AI models may occasionally outperform the US, restrictions and limited semiconductor capabilities hinder progress. To remain competitive, the US should monitor Chinese advancements and protect intellectual property while China continues leveraging collaborations, open-source models, and government support.
