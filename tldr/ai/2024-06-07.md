[### AI is creating a golden age for scammers. Now is the time to get your personal details OFF the web (Sponsor)](https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=1151&amp;aff_id=16286)

Odds are, you've received a suspicious phone call, text, or email asking for money. The scam might have been easy to spot ‚Äî but with deepfakes and genAI, things are getting much weirder.

Sophisticated scams start with bad actors laying hands on your personal data. Often, they purchase this data legally from [data brokers](https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=1151&aff_id=16286) who profit from selling your phone number, DOB, SSN, and more.

[Incogni](https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=1151&aff_id=16286) scrubs your personal data from the web, confronting the 180+ data brokers on your behalf. And unlike other services, Incogni helps [remove your sensitive information from ALL broker types](https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=1151&aff_id=16286), including people search sites.

[### Nvidia emails: Elon Musk diverting Tesla GPUs to his other companies (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/elon-musk-is-diverting-teslas-gpus-to-x-xai-nvidia-emails-say?utm_source=tldrai)

Elon Musk redirected 12,000 H100 GPUs ordered by Tesla to X. He had told investors in April that Tesla had spent $1 billion on GPUs in the three months of the year. Tesla has been developing its own in-house supercomputer for AI, but Musk has previously said that it would be redundant if the company could source more H100s. X's order of 12,000 H100s will be redirected to Tesla.

[### A Grand Unified Theory of the AI Hype Cycle (8 minute read)](https://blog.glyph.im/2024/05/grand-unified-ai-hype.html?utm_source=tldrai)

The AI industry has seen several hype cycles throughout the decades, each producing genuinely useful technology and lasting longer than the last. Every cycle follows the process of a sigmoid curve rather than an exponential one. All strategies for developing the technology inevitably have a limit that doesn't take too long to find. While the current AI hype cycle is unlike any that have come before it, it will likely follow a similar trajectory as previous cycles.
