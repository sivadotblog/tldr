### Research & Innovation

[### Brainformer: trade simplicity for efficiency (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00008?utm_source=tldrai)

Transformers are amazingly powerful and foundational to much of AI's recent success. They follow a somewhat simple recipe of alternating fully connected and attention blocks. It turns out using a genetic search algorithm and a huge pile of TPUs, the folks at Google were able to find a model that converges 5x faster and runs 2x faster for inference. It uses MoE blocks and some other clever tricks.

[### The Rise of ArtGPT-4 and its Artistic Vision (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07490?utm_source=tldrai)

Recent advancements in AI have led to the creation of ArtGPT-4, a new language and image understanding model that is trained in a way to specifically understand and create artistic images. Despite being smaller and requiring less data, it outperforms other models in terms of artistic image understanding and creation, and even comes close to matching human artists in some tests.

[### BlendFields: A Novel Approach for Facial Modeling (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07514?utm_source=tldrai)

Creating realistic visualizations of human faces is a complex task that demands capturing both large and minute details. A new method, inspired by traditional computer graphics techniques, has been developed to accurately model unseen expressions by using a few extreme poses and then recreating their appearance for new expressions, resulting in finer, more realistic facial details.

### Engineering & Resources

[### AWQ: Making Big AI Models Smaller and Faster (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper presents Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), a new method that compresses large language models (LLMs) more efficiently, overcoming issues of high hardware requirements and slow token generation. AWQ selectively protects the most important weights in the model and allows for a better generalization on different domains, outperforming existing methods, and leading to faster and more efficient model deployments.

[### CodeTF: Python Library for Code Intelligence (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/salesforce/codetf?utm_source=tldrai)

CodeTF is an all-in-one Python library designed for enhancing code intelligence, making it easier to train models for tasks like code generation, translation, and summarization. It simplifies the process by offering user-friendly tools for code manipulation, rapid inferencing, fine-tuning models, evaluating performance, and working with preprocessed data sets across many programming languages.

[### AITemplate (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/facebookincubator/AITemplate?utm_source=tldrai)

AITemplate is a Python framework that transforms deep neural networks into CUDA (NVIDIA GPU)/HIP (AMD GPU) C++ code for lightning-fast inference serving.
