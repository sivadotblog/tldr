[### How to use contextual AI to surface relevant information, mid-conversation (Sponsor)](https://www.glean.com/webinars/answers-into-conversation-zoom?utm_source=3rd-party&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=glean-zoom-webinar&amp;utm_partner=TLDR)

Employees switch between apps +1,200 times per day, killing productivity. This "toggle tax" is avoidable: AI + integrations can give users the information they need, without rummaging through 37 open tabs.

On [October 9](https://www.glean.com/webinars/answers-into-conversation-zoom?utm_source=3rd-party&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=glean-zoom-webinar&utm_partner=TLDR), technical experts from Glean and Zoom will demonstrate how contextual AI can surface relevant answers‚Äîboth from your enterprise data and from the web‚Äîdirectly inside your Zoom conversations (or wherever employees communicate).

The session covers real scenarios for Sales, Support, and Engineering teams, and how the integration keeps sensitive data private while making discovery effortless. You'll also get a [rollout playbook](https://www.glean.com/webinars/answers-into-conversation-zoom?utm_source=3rd-party&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=glean-zoom-webinar&utm_partner=TLDR) for driving adoption and measuring ROI.
