### Research & Innovation

[### Video Point Tracking (2 minute read)](https://ku-cvlab.github.io/locotrack/?utm_source=tldrai)

LocoTrack is an advanced model for tracking any point across video sequences. It uses local 4D correlation and bidirectional correspondence for precise tracking. LocoTrack operates nearly six times faster than current leading models.

[### Improved Test-Time Adaptation (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15773v1?utm_source=tldrai)

STAble Memory rePlay (STAMP) is a method that addresses distribution shifts between training and test data using only unlabeled test data. Unlike existing methods, STAMP excels in both recognizing known classes and rejecting outliers during inference.

[### Star Operation to Train Neural Networks (15 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19967v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The star operation is a method that enriches AI models by projecting data into complex, high-dimensional spaces without the need for bulky architectures.
