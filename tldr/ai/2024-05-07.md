[### AI Prompt Engineering Is Dead (6 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/prompt-engineering-is-dead?utm_source=tldrai)

Automating prompt optimization for AI models suggests a future where manual prompt engineering may become obsolete, pointing towards more efficient, model-driven methods of generating effective prompts.

[### Limits of Vision-Language Models in Visual Reasoning (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/apple/ml-rpm-bench?utm_source=tldrai)

Vision-Language Models like GPT-4V are advancing rapidly in understanding and interacting with images and text. A recent study uncovers their significant limitations in visual deductive reasoning. Researchers tested these models using complex visual puzzles, like those found in IQ tests, and discovered that they struggle with multi-step reasoning and recognizing abstract patterns.

[### DeepSeek-V2 (Hugging Face Hub)](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Chat?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepSeek has released a 200B+ parameter model with 21B active parameters. It performs extremely well on code and reasoning. It's not clear if it is overall better than Llama 3 70B, but it is a welcome addition to the open model ecosystem.
