### Headlines & Launches

[### AMD's new language models (12 minute read)](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/technical-articles/introducing-the-first-amd-1b-language-model.html?utm_source=tldrai)

AMD used the OLMO codebase to train and release a language model trained on its accelerators.

[### Oasis by Etched & Decart (4 minute read)](https://www.etched.com/blog-posts/oasis?utm_source=tldrai)

Etched and Decart's Oasis is an AI model that generates open-world games frame-by-frame from user inputs, showcasing advanced physical understanding and real-time interaction. Oasis uses a Diffusion Transformer architecture optimized for the upcoming Sohu chip, enabling large-scale, low-latency 4K video models. The model, which integrates custom hardware for improved performance at scale, represents a shift towards interactive AI-generated content.

[### OpenAI will start using AMD chips and could make its own AI hardware in 2026 (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282843/openai-custom-hardware-amd-nvidia-ai-chips?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is collaborating with Broadcom and TSMC to develop custom AI chips which are expected to begin production by 2026. Meanwhile, OpenAI is integrating AMD's MI300 chips into its Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Despite aligning with other tech giants on custom chip strategies, OpenAI remains behind Google, Microsoft, and Amazon in hardware development.

[### 3D Scene Reconstruction Without Camera Pose (6 minute read)](https://noposplat.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

NoPoSplat is a feed-forward model that can reconstruct 3D scenes from sparse, multi-view images without needing accurate camera poses.

[### Improving Language Models' Reasoning (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23856v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study tackles a unique challenge in LLMs: how well they handle reasoning prompts that contain irrelevant or incorrect rationale snippets.

[### Long-Context Evaluation in Language Models (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23771v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study identifies a key flaw in using perplexity (PPL) to evaluate LLMs' long-context capabilities - PPL averages across all tokens and misses crucial ones needed for understanding extended inputs. To improve this, the authors introduce LongPPL, a metric that highlights these essential tokens for a clearer measure of long-context performance.

[### We're forking Flutter. This is why (11 minute read)](https://flutterfoundation.dev/blog/posts/we-are-forking-flutter-this-is-why/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google's corporate focus shift to AI has deprioritized Flutter's desktop platforms, creating a labor shortage for this once rapidly expanding UI toolkit. In response, a fork named Flock is being developed to include essential bug fixes and features the Flutter team can't tackle, aiming to accelerate Flutter's growth through community involvement. Flock plans to improve contribution processes and streamline PR reviews, bridging the gap in support and development pace left by the main Flutter team.

[### Using Reinforcement Learning and $4.80 of GPU Time to Find the Best HN Post Ever (RLHF Part 1) (11 minute read)](https://openpipe.ai/blog/hacker-news-rlhf-part-1?utm_source=tldrai)

This article discusses using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to develop a reward model that predicts upvote counts for Hacker News stories. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset and $4.80 of GPU time, the reward model was trained on features like titles, authors, and content to optimize for post quality, with the ultimate goal of utilizing RLHF techniques to enhance the creation of high-value content. The resulting model, while not perfect, can successfully identify underappreciated stories and predict potential front-page hits.
