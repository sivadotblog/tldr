Cursor has closed a $2.3 billion funding round at a $29.3 billion post-money valuation. The tool has crossed $1 billion in annualized revenue and swelled to more than 300 employees since it first launched in 2023. Coding tools have proved to be a lucrative AI use case. OpenAI approached Anysphere to potentially purchase Cursor earlier this year, but the deal failed to gain traction.

Thinking Machines Lab is in early talks to raise new funding at a roughly $50 billion valuation. The new financing would more than quadruple the startup's valuation from July. The deal's terms have yet to be finalized and could change. Thinking Machines aims to build AI models and products to help businesses by supporting more 'human-AI collaboration' across every field of work. The startup has dozens of employees who previously worked at OpenAI.

[### Nano Banana can be prompt engineered for extremely nuanced AI image generation (26 minute read)](https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/?utm_source=tldrai)

Nano Banana allows for very strong generation control, but it has several issues. It is terrible at style transfer, even though it has essentially no restrictions on intellectual property. The model can be used to create highly specific, high-quality images. This article looks at some of the tricks to using the model.

[### GenAI observability: 6 practical recommendations (Sponsor)](https://www.dynatrace.com/info/reports/bring-clarity-to-your-ai-systems/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=cloud-ai-observability-hyperframe-observability-for-ai&amp;utm_term=111425)

GenAI and agentic AI are powerful but unpredictable. It's not just hallucination — they regularly take entirely new paths through established workflows. Clarity requires more than monitoring: this [Dynatrace report](https://www.dynatrace.com/info/reports/bring-clarity-to-your-ai-systems/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=cloud-ai-observability-hyperframe-observability-for-ai&utm_term=111425) lays out six pragmatic observability recommendations for practitioners preparing their organizations for GenAI and agentic AI.

[### Introducing GPT-5.1 for developers (2 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1-for-developers/?utm_source=tldrai)

GPT-5.1 uses fewer tokens on simple tasks and shows modest benchmark gains on SWE-bench (+3.5 points to 76.3%) and GPQA Diamond (+2.4 points to 88.1%). On other capabilities, its benchmark scores are flat or slightly lower.

[### Weight-sparse transformers have interpretable circuits (8 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/understanding-neural-networks-through-sparse-circuits/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI trained language models with most weights forced to zero, making it easier to identify which neurons link together into a “circuit” representing a certain concept. The approach successfully isolated circuits for tasks like Python quote-matching that are both necessary (removing them breaks the behavior) and sufficient (they work in isolation).

[### Introducing Code Wiki: Accelerating your code understanding (3 minute read)](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-code-wiki-accelerating-your-code-understanding/?utm_source=tldrai)

Code Wiki is a platform that maintains a continuously updated, structured wiki for code repositories. It scans the full code base and regenerates documentation after each change, so docs evolve with the code. Every wiki section and chat answer is hyperlinked directly to the relevant code files and definitions. The platform will allow new contributors to start immediately, while senior developers can now understand new libraries in minutes.

Google users in the US will soon be able to ask AI Mode complex questions about what to buy. The model will respond with suggestions, guides, tables, and other generated content to help them decide. Some of the content that appears in AI Mode will be ads. There will be an agentic checkout feature that lets AI automatically make purchases with Google Pay at specific retailers. Shopping features are also coming to the Gemini app, but there won't be sponsored content in the results for the time being.

[### Jevons or Bust (10 minute read)](https://a16z.substack.com/p/jevons-or-bust?utm_source=tldrai)

Demand for AI is growing, and it seems that it is paying demand. AI is driving incremental revenue to big cloud providers. However, this doesn't mean that AI is definitely a Jevonic-non-bubble instead of a capex binge that ends badly. We have yet to see whether the demand side will materialize.
