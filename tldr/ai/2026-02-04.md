[### Perplexity Cannot Always Tell Right from Wrong (1 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22950?utm_source=tldrai)

Perplexity is a function that measures models' overall level of surprise when encountering a particular output. It has gained significant traction in recent years as both a loss function and as a simple-to-compute metric of model quality. However, it may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Perplexity will not always select for the most accurate model - any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected.

The GenAI Chatbot app market has increased 152% year on year since last January. ChatGPT is losing market share, but this is expected as new capable entrants have launched. Most people have still never used a GenAI Chatbot app. About 20% of AI users use at least two apps, signaling that some apps are better for certain tasks than others.

[### Most People Can't Vibe Code. Here's How We Fix That (6 minute read)](https://www.a16z.news/p/most-people-cant-vibe-code-heres?utm_source=tldrai)

Vibe coding has yet to reach mainstream consumers, remaining primarily the domain of technical users. Companies like Poke and Wabi are developing consumer-friendly AI products that eliminate complex technical setup and terminology. The real opportunity lies in creating tools that make software development accessible to non-technical users, similar to how Squarespace and Canva democratized websites and design.
