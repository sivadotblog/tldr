### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI Announces Team To Build ‚ÄòCrowdsourced‚Äô Governance Ideas Into Its Models (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/16/openai-announces-team-to-build-crowdsourced-governance-ideas-into-its-models/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is forming a new Collective Alignment team to integrate public input into its AI models.

[### Stablecode 3B (4 minute read)](https://stability.ai/news/stable-code-2024-llm-code-completion-release?utm_source=tldrai)

A strong 3B model that outperforms the 7B CodeLlama model and is small enough to run locally on MacBooks.

[### Sakana AI raises $30m seed (3 minute read)](https://sakana.ai/seed-round/?utm_source=tldrai)

Sakana.ai is building a world-class research lab in Tokyo to build smaller and more efficient foundation models. The company was founded by ex-Google researchers David Ha and Llion Jones, who are responsible for breakthroughs such as Transformers, World Models, and LoRA. It has raised a 30m seed round from Brandon Reeves at Lux Capital and Jon Chu at Khosla Ventures to pioneer this effort and put Tokyo on the AI map.

### Research & Innovation

[### Solve hard problems training on easy data (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06751?utm_source=tldrai)

Hard problems have been thought to require hard data, but that data is hard to label and noisy. This work shows that fine-tuning models on related, but easy, data dramatically improves their generation capabilities on hard problems. Another data point to support fine-tuning as eliciting knowledge instead of adding knowledge.

[### Teaching language models to listen (13 minute read)](https://paul.mou.dev/posts/2023-12-31-listening-with-llm/?utm_source=tldrai)

This blog explores the current dominant paradigm for taking a pretrained language model and adding multimodal capabilities. Namely, aligning the embeddings between an encoder and the text model.

[### Person Re-identification (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06430v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a novel approach called Mutual Distillation Learning For Person Re-identification (MDPR) that enhances person re-identification by combining two different techniques.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Benchmarking Power BI on Microsoft Fabric: Marketing or a Real Semantic Layer Solution? (Sponsor)](https://www.atscale.com/?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft is marketing that its Direct Lake architecture on Fabric is the ideal way to run direct queries on cloud storage in Power BI. Does the data support their claim? This [webinar](https://www.atscale.com/) will dive deep into [AtScale‚Äôs TPC-DS benchmark report](https://www.atscale.com/) that tests the scalability, cost effectiveness and manageability of Microsoft Fabric Architecture.

[### Enhancing AI Understanding with Context Filtering (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/zorazrw/filco?utm_source=tldrai)

FILCO is a new technique designed to improve AI systems, especially in areas like answering questions and checking facts, by giving them better context. It works by choosing the most helpful information and training models to filter out less relevant details.

[### Diffusion models for content super resolution (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/csslc/CCSR?utm_source=tldrai)

Following the recent trend of repurposing diffusion models for various other vision tasks, this work improves the stability of training for super resolution and upscaling.

[### Tencent PhotoMaker (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker?utm_source=tldrai)

One of the most viral uses of generative image models is personal stylized image generation. Historically, this required training a LoRA or using DreamBooth. Now, with the use of ID embeddings, you can dramatically improve quality while reducing computational cost, with just a single image.

### Miscellaneous

[### Improving the Trustworthiness of AI Explanations (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/annahedstroem/sanity-checks-revisited?utm_source=tldrai)

This project improves the Model Parameter Randomisation Test, a key tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), by introducing two new versions: Smooth MPRT and Efficient MPRT.

[### Haiku DPO dataset (HuggingFace Dataset)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/davanstrien/haiku_dpo?utm_source=tldrai)

Dataset to help align models to write correct Haiku‚Äôs.

[### The Lazy Tyranny Of The Wait Calculation (8 minute read)](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-lazy-tyranny-of-the-wait-calculation?utm_source=tldrai)

The "Wait Calculation" concept advises delaying actions, like a space journey to Barnard's Star or starting certain projects, until technology sufficiently advances to save significant time and effort. However, this approach must be balanced against potential learning losses and the unpredictability of technological progress.
