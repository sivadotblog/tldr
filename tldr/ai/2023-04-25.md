### Headlines & Launches

[### Gen-1 on iOS (1 minute read)](https://runwayml.com/?utm_source=tldrai)

Runway introduces the new iOS app featuring Gen-1, which allows users to transform their phone's camera content and revive forgotten videos.

[### Google Releases Security LLM (2 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/security/google-releases-security-llm-at-rsac-to-rival-microsofts-gpt-4-based-copilot/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google has announced the release of Google Cloud Security AI Workbench, a security platform powered by Sec-PaLM, a large language model (LLM) designed specifically for cybersecurity use cases.

[### AI is really good for low skilled workers (50 minute read)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161?utm_source=tldrai)

When a conversational AI tool is used to support customer support they get a big boost, somewhere around 14% on average with an increase in employee AND customer satisfaction. Interestingly, it seems like the biggest bump is for lower skilled support agents. This might be because they now have access to a broad knowledge base that was hard to get before. This also increased employee retention. They don‚Äôt touch on wage effects of these tools, but merely explore potential productivity gains.

### Research & Innovation

[### What happens if we give language models anxiety? (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11111?utm_source=tldrai)

There are certain types of phrases that are used in computational psychiatry and are known to elicit or measure anxiety. As it turns out, if we use these and other emotion causing prompts, ChatGPT responds strongly. It also increases its ability to explore and its bias in some settings.

[### DiffFit: Unlocking Transferability of Large Diffusion Models via Simple Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06648?utm_source=tldrai)

DiffFit, a parameter-efficient strategy for fine-tuning large pre-trained diffusion models, enables fast adaptation to new domains while significantly reducing training time and storage costs. Achieving superior performance on downstream datasets, DiffFit sets a new state-of-the-art FID on the ImageNet 512x512 benchmark and demonstrates its potential for adapting low-resolution models to high-resolution ones with minimal cost.

[### Is Adam actually the best, or did we make it the best? (6 minute read)](https://parameterfree.com/2020/12/06/neural-network-maybe-evolved-to-make-adam-the-best-optimizer/?utm_source=tldrai)

Many folks use a variant of Adam such as AdamW, but for the most part Adam is still the default architecture for deep learning. It is certainly what we often start with. What if it‚Äôs only the best because it‚Äôs the one thing researchers don‚Äôt change when they explore the deep learning performance? There is a line of philosophy around this including the hardware lottery. This is a hard problem to fix, mostly because jointly developing an optimizer and architecture is challenging.

### Engineering & Resources

[### VisFusion: Visibility-aware Online 3D Scene Reconstruction from Videos (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/huiyu-gao/VisFusion?utm_source=tldrai)

VisFusion is a visibility-aware online 3D scene reconstruction method from posed monocular videos, improving feature fusion by inferring visibility using a similarity matrix calculated from projected features in each image pair. The approach employs a coarse-to-fine pipeline with a volume sparsification process, preserving fine details by sparsifying voxels locally along each visual ray, and enhancing TSDF predictions through learning residuals across scales.

[### SILVR: Guided Diffusion for Molecule Generation (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10905?utm_source=tldrai)

The selective iterative latent variable refinement (SILVR) method conditions diffusion-based equivariant generative models without retraining, generating novel molecules that fit a protein's binding site based on fragment hits. Using the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease fragments as a reference dataset, SILVR demonstrates the ability to generate new molecules with similar shapes to original fragments, fitting the binding site without knowledge of the protein, and merging up to three fragments into a new molecule without affecting the underlying generative model's quality.

Cheetah is an AI-powered macOS app designed to assist users during remote software engineering interviews by providing real-time, discreet coaching and live coding platform integration.

[### Why Agents Are The Next Killer AI App (10 minute read)](https://www.latent.space/p/agents?utm_source=tldrai)

This article makes the case that autonomous agents like Auto-GPT are the next big use-case for AI. Auto-GPT (and its younger sibling BabyAGI) are independently developed Python projects that have caught enormous popularity, with Auto-GPT trending #1 on Twitter and GitHub in the past 2 weeks.

[### The AI Doomers‚Äô Playbook (5 minute read)](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/14/the-ai-doomers-playbook/?utm_source=tldrai)

This article dives into the playbooks of some of the larger AI doomers. AI Doomerism is becoming mainstream thanks to mass media, which drives our discussion about Generative AI from bad to worse, or from slightly insane to batshit crazy. Instead of out-of-control AI, we have out-of-control panic.

[### AI-Driven Robots Start Hunting For Novel Materials Without Help From Humans (3 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/article/ai-driven-robots-start-hunting-novel-materials-without-help-humans?utm_source=tldrai)

AI-driven robots are beginning to autonomously discover novel materials without human assistance, showcasing the potential for artificial intelligence to revolutionize material science research and accelerate the development of new technologies and applications.
