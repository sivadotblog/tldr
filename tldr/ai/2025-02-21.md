[### AI is transforming SaaS pricing‚Äîare you ready? A discussion with Metronome and Kyle Poyar (Sponsor)](https://hubs.li/Q037q18G0)

The shift from seat-based pricing models to usage-based pricing (UBP) has been going on for a while ‚Äî but AI is pushing companies to evolve their pricing models further and faster.

Kyle Poyar is an expert on SaaS pricing and on February 26th, he will be joining [Metronome's new pricing webinar series](https://hubs.li/Q037q18G0), where they'll discuss:

* UBP and aligning pricing with customer value
* New trends such as [AI-driven pricing and outcome-based models](https://hubs.li/Q037q18G0)
* 2025 pricing predictions and how to stay competitive

Join live next Wednesday ‚Üí[The Future of SaaS Pricing Webinar with Kyle Poyar](https://hubs.li/Q037q18G0)

### Engineering & Resources

[### Open Reasoner Zero (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Open-Reasoner-Zero/Open-Reasoner-Zero?utm_source=tldrai)

Open replication of the zero reasoning paradigm. It is fully open source with training data, scripts, and weights.

[### Efficient web crawling for LLM pre-training (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/cxcscmu/Crawl4LLM?utm_source=tldrai)

Most data from web crawls gets thrown away due to poor text extraction performance. This work dramatically improves how many documents get saved and uses that to train stronger models on a fraction of the crawled data.

[### Evaluating Factuality in LLMs (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Babelscape/LLM-Oasis?utm_source=tldrai)

LLM-Oasis is a large-scale dataset designed to train and evaluate systems for assessing factuality in outputs from LLMs.
