### Research & Innovation

[### Gemini paper (35 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805?utm_source=tldrai)

This 850+ author paper outlines much of the Gemini language modeling effort from Google. It's understandably short on key architectural and dataset details, but gives attribution and evaluation details.

[### 3D Structure Reconstruction from 2D Landmarks (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11894v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The new 3D-LFM model uses transformers to reconstruct 3D structures from 2D landmarks without needing 'in-correspondence' 3D data. This approach, the first of its kind, efficiently handles varying point numbers, occlusions, and can generalize to unseen categories.

[### My jaw hit the floor when I watched an AI master one of the world's toughest physical games in just six hours (4 minute read)](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/my-jaw-hit-the-floor-when-i-watched-an-ai-master-one-of-the-worlds-toughest-physical-games-in-just-six-hours?utm_source=tldrai)

AI can play the game Labyrinth exponentially better than humans, with a best time of just 14.8 seconds. It can learn how to do so in just six hours. Labyrinth is an incredibly difficult physical board game that takes fine motor control, dexterity, and a lot of real-time problem-solving to win.

[### Multilingual Scene Text Generation (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12232?utm_source=tldrai)

Diff-Text is a new training-free framework for creating photo-realistic images with text in any language. It enhances the Stable Diffusion model's multilingual capabilities by using sketched images as priors.
