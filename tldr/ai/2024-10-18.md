[### Where's The Generative AI ROI? Start With The Supply Chain (7 minute read)](https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/wheres-the-generative-ai-roi-start?utm_source=tldrai)

Generative AI is transforming supply chain operations by efficiently processing unstructured documents, leading to significant time and cost savings. Flexport, a supply chain tech company, has successfully integrated AI to automate and streamline document handling, reducing processing time by 80%. This application of AI demonstrates its value in practical, revenue-generating tasks rather than more speculative AI advancements.

[### Follow the Quiet Voices to Find AI's Truths (6 minute read)](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/follow-the-quiet-voices-to-find-ais?utm_source=tldrai)

AI discourse is polarized, with opposing pro-AI and anti-AI factions dominating the conversation. Synthetical thinkers, who approach AI with nuanced perspectives beyond binary viewpoints, are currently missing from this debate. These truth-seekers may eventually return when AI becomes less controversial and more integrated into everyday life.

[### Invisible text that AI chatbots understand and humans can't? Yep, it's a thing (13 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/ai-chatbots-can-read-and-write-invisible-text-creating-an-ideal-covert-channel/?utm_source=tldrai)

Recent research highlights vulnerabilities in LLMs like prompt injection and ASCII smuggling, which allow attackers to hide instructions or data that are invisible to users but readable by the models. Invisible Unicode characters can be used in AI chatbots like Claude and Copilot to embed and extract malicious payloads and sensitive data. This poses a significant security risk. While some AI platforms like OpenAI and Microsoft have implemented mitigations, the broader issue of AI processing data imperceptible to humans continues to challenge security protocols.
