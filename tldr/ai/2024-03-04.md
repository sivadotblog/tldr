### Headlines & Launches

[### Elon Musk Sues OpenAI (4 minute read)](https://www.courthousenews.com/elon-musk-sues-openai-over-ai-threat/?utm_source=tldrai)

Elon Musk, co-founder of OpenAI, is suing the company claiming - among other things - that GPT-4 constitutes AGI and is no longer subject to the Microsoft agreement. He also argues for more transparency and openness.

[### OpenAI wants to make a walking, talking humanoid robot smarter (9 minute read)](https://www.popsci.com/technology/openai-wants-to-make-a-walking-talking-humanoid-robot-smarter?utm_source=tldrai)

Humanoid robots could be working alongside human manufacturing workers in only a few short years. Figure, a prominent company in the humanoid robot space, recently raised $675 million and struck a new agreement with OpenAI to develop next-generation AI models for its robots. The funding, which was reportedly over $150 million more than the amount Figure had initially sought, will help scale up the company's AI training, robotic manufacturing, and add on new engineers, speeding up the company's timeline for making its product available commercially. OpenAI's technology will help improve Figure's robots' semantic understanding, making them more useful in work scenarios.

[### HyperAttention: Used in Gemini (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05869?utm_source=tldrai)

It is widely believed, and unofficially confirmed, that Gemini‚Äôs amazing 1m+ token context window uses HyperAttention to achieve such success.

[### GPT-4 Only Succeeds on 14% of Agent Tasks (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13854?utm_source=tldrai)

The community is very excited about the potential of Agents to tackle a variety of digital workloads. However, even the best general-purpose models struggle to complete tasks where humans succeed 70%+ of the time. It is becoming clear that we may need specially trained models for these tasks.

[### Why do learning rates transfer? (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17457?utm_source=tldrai)

A theoretical paper that attempts to explain the success of MuP hyperparameter transfer. Its authors find that the largest eigenvalue of the training loss Hessian is independent of the width and depth of the network.
