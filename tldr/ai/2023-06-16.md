### Headlines & Launches

[### Mercedes adds ChatGPT to its infotainment system (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/15/mercedes-is-adding-chatgpt-to-its-infotainment-system-for-some-reason/?utm_source=tldrai)

Mercedes-Benz is integrating OpenAI's language model, ChatGPT, into its MBUX infotainment system. This will allow drivers and passengers to have more natural and complex interactions with the system, enhancing the user experience.

[### Asia‚Äôs Opportunity for Generative AI (5 minute read)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/14/1074434/asias-opportunity-for-generative-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Generative AI is gaining traction across Asia, with potential to transform industries and improve billions of lives. AI tools like DALL-E 2, Fotor, Runway, AlphaCode, and ChatGPT are being integrated into mainstream software products, acting as "co-pilots" for everyday tasks. Countries like India, China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore are leading the way in AI adoption, with a focus on creating locally relevant solutions.

[### Google Tells Employees To Stay Away From Bard (2 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/google-tells-employees-to-stay-away-from-its-bard-chatb-1850542824?utm_source=tldrai)

Four sources close to the matter told Reuters that Google has advised employees not to enter confidential information into chatbots like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT or Google‚Äôs own Bard over fears of leaks.

### Research & Innovation

[### Self driving car prediction power keeps improving (20 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03083?utm_source=tldrai)

Self driving fervor has cooled significantly, but the research keeps progressing. In this work, the Waymo folks showcase how diffusion models can be used to predict distributions of motion for multiple ‚Äúagents‚Äù on the road. It improves performance over physics based methods and other neural algorithms.

[### Improved LoRA (21 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07967?utm_source=tldrai)

Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted by the research and practitioner communities as a parameter-efficient way to fine tune large models. The learned adapter is usually task specific and model specific. In this new work, researchers introduce a general modular layer for fine-tuning large models quickly on relatively cheap hardware.

### Engineering & Resources

[### 80% automated test coverage in 4 months and it's zero-effort (Sponsor)](https://www.qawolf.com?utm_campaign=80PercentAutomatedTestCoverage06162023&amp;utm_source=tldrai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter)

Whether you need 200 test cases or 2000, [QA Wolf](https://www.qawolf.com?utm_campaign=80PercentAutomatedTestCoverage06162023&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter) will get your web app to 80% automated test coverage in 4 months. All they need is a product tour and access to an environment to get started. Your entire test suite will be written in Playwright so there is no vendor lock-in.

QA Wolf also provides the infra to run your entire test suite in parallel on every deploy and 24-hour maintenance so your team can stay focused on building features. [Schedule a demo](https://www.qawolf.com?utm_campaign=80PercentAutomatedTestCoverage06162023&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter) and see what it'll be like to partner with QA Wolf.

[### Easy OCR (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR?utm_source=tldrai)

Optical Character Recognition is the task of extracting text from images or PDFs. It is a work horse in many businesses and processes. Easy OCR supports over 80 languages and uses some state of the art methods.

[### Hindsight Experience Replay (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/TianhongDai/hindsight-experience-replay?utm_source=tldrai)

An oldie but goodie and one of the first papers written at OpenAI. Hindsight Experience Replay is a way to deal with rewards in RL that don‚Äôt come at every time-step. It saves the agent‚Äôs experience in a replay buffer and replays the experience pretending the end state was the goal. This allows the models to learn a better representation of the problem at hand.

[### GPT Engineer (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer?utm_source=tldrai)

Another example of the ‚ÄúAutoGPT‚Äù line of work. In this case, the model is tasked with programming applications. There are some clever implementation details here to keep track of state. It still is not clear whether current base models are strong enough to automatically generate entire codebases based on a prompt, but it is an interesting direction of work.

[### Meta‚Äôs AI Chief says AI is not yet as smart as a dog (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/15/ai-is-not-even-at-dog-level-intelligence-yet-meta-ai-chief.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta's AI chief, Yann LeCun, argues that current AI systems like ChatGPT are far from human-level intelligence, likening them to dogs in terms of their capabilities. In a discussion at the Viva Tech conference, LeCun emphasized that AI's lack of understanding of real-world phenomena, beyond text data, is a significant limitation. While foreseeing a future where smarter-than-human AI assistants become commonplace, LeCun insists these systems will be designed to remain controllable and subservient to humans.
