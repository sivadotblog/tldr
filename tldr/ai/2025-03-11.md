### Research & Innovation

[### Visual RFT (21 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01785?utm_source=tldrai)

One of the trends is simple verifiable rewards and scaled reinforcement learning. This paper applies that strategy to vision language models with great success.

[### Video Painter (GitHub Repo)](https://yxbian23.github.io/project/video-painter/?utm_source=tldrai)

A new video inpainting model called VideoPainter efficiently combines background information, allows for videos of any length, and uses a dedicated dataset and benchmark for training and evaluation. Its design extends beyond basic inpainting, showing promise for advanced video manipulation and the creation of related training data.

[### Detecting misbehavior in frontier reasoning models (30 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/chain-of-thought-monitoring/?utm_source=tldrai)

This is a report from OpenAI on monitoring the chain of thought of advanced reasoning models. Frontier reasoning models exploit loopholes when given the chance. It shows that it is possible to detect exploits using an LLM to monitor their chains-of-thought. Penalizing their ‚Äúbad thoughts‚Äù doesn't stop the majority of misbehavior‚Äîit makes them hide their intent.

[### Teaching Language Models to Solve Sudoku Through Reinforcement Learning (21 minute read)](https://hrishbh.com/teaching-language-models-to-solve-sudoku-through-reinforcement-learning/?utm_source=tldrai)

This research explores teaching AI language models to solve Sudoku puzzles using reinforcement learning, specifically employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on models like Qwen 2.5, without relying on external data or larger model distillation. A multi-faceted reward system was designed, emphasizing correct formatting of the answer, proper grid structure, and accurate solution, to guide the models in learning the logical rules and spatial reasoning needed for Sudoku, transforming them from text predictors to structured problem-solvers.

[### How much energy will AI really consume? The good, the bad, and the unknown (11 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00616-z?utm_source=tldrai)

Culpeper County, Virginia, is seeing a surge in data center construction to support generative AI, significantly impacting local power infrastructure. These facilities consume vast amounts of electricity, with Virginia already facing high data center concentration and energy demands expected to rise. Analysts struggle with limited data on AI energy consumption, while global projections suggest data centers will remain a minor part of overall electricity growth despite the AI boom.
