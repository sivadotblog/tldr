The early days of search were heavily keyword-based. Later, ML and NLP enabled search engines to interpret the semantics behind queries, allowing for more accurate and contextually relevant results.

Today search is changing again with the rise of AI and especially genAI.

[### Anthropic Claude 4 models a little more willing than before to blackmail some users (5 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/22/anthropic_claude_opus_4_sonnet/?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic's new Claude models are more willing than prior models to take initiative on their own in agentic contexts. This can show up as more actively helpful behavior in ordinary coding settings, but it can cause the model to act concerningly when prompted with strong moral imperatives. This can include locking users out of systems or bulk-emailing media and law-enforcement figures to inform them of wrongdoing. The behavior only shows up in testing environments where the model is given unusually free access to tools and very unusual instructions.
