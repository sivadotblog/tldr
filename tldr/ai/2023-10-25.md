### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI plans major updates to lure developers with lower costs (5 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-major-updates-lure-developers-with-lower-costs-sources-2023-10-11?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is planning significant updates to help developers create AI-based applications more affordably and swiftly. The updates include the addition of memory storage and new vision capabilities for developers that could greatly reduce development costs. The enhancements are expected to be announced at OpenAI‚Äôs first-ever developer conference on November 6th.

[### Leading AI Expert Advocates for Urgent Global Response to AI Risks Comparable to Climate Crisis (4 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/24/ai-risk-climate-crisis-google-deepmind-chief-demis-hassabis-regulation?utm_source=tldrai)

Google's AI unit's CEO, Demis Hassabis, warns that the world needs to address AI risks urgently, similarly to the climate crisis. He suggests an oversight body like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to tackle dangers from AI. Hassabis believes AI could be highly beneficial, but its potential risks require international attention.

[### This new data poisoning tool lets artists fight back against generative AI (5 minute read)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/23/1082189/data-poisoning-artists-fight-generative-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers from the University of Chicago have developed a tool that allows artists to add invisible changes to their artwork. Nightshade causes AI models trained on these pieces to malfunction. The tool aims to deter AI firms from using artists' works without permission. Nightshade will be integrated into Glaze, a tool for artists to mask their styling, and will be made open-source for wider use.

### Research & Innovation

[### Improved video diffusion with noise scheduling (25 minute read)](http://haonanqiu.com/projects/FreeNoise.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Generating a single image from a single prompt is generally fine, but fails when generating video because of the temporal changes between frames. However, consistency when changing text is quite challenging. This work tackles both of these problems and enables generations up to 512 frames long using diffusion.

[### Using Segment Anything Model for 3D Medical Imaging (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/uni-medical/sam-med3d?utm_source=tldrai)

SAM-Med3D is an upgraded version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) tailored specifically for 3D medical imaging. While the original SAM struggled with 3D medical images, SAM-Med3D, trained on a vast dataset of over 131K 3D masks, delivers superior results by capturing 3D spatial details with fewer input prompts.
