Ilya Sutskever has launched Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI), a startup focused solely on developing a safe and powerful AI system free from the commercial pressures faced by companies like OpenAI.

[### Apple's Intelligent Strategy (6 minute read)](https://sdw.space/apples-intelligent-strategy/?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple's WWDC revelations highlight its strategic positioning in AI with a focus on privacy and security and employing in-house chips and a zero-trust architecture in its Private Cloud. Apple's AI integrates OpenAI's ChatGPT for tasks beyond its scope, with a business model where AI suppliers may financially contribute to access Apple's user base. Apple's approach to privacy could leverage upcoming regulations as a competitive advantage, aligning with its commitment to user privacy and potentially reinforcing its dominance in tech.

[### Roblox's Road to 4D Generative AI (3 minute read)](https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/06/robloxs-road-to-4d-generative-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

Roblox is building toward 4D generative AI, going beyond single 3D objects to dynamic interactions. Solving the challenge of 4D will require multimodal understanding across appearance, shape, physics, and scripts. Early tools that are foundational for its 4D system are already accelerating creation on the platform.

### Research & Innovation

[### Microsoft's Florence-2 state-of-the-art vision model (Hugging Face Hub)](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large-ft?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft has released an MIT-licensed set of small VLMs that dramatically outperform much larger models on captioning, bounding, and classification.

[### Logit Prisms: Decomposing Transformer Outputs For Mechanistic Interpretability (13 minute read)](https://neuralblog.github.io/logit-prisms/?utm_source=tldrai)

The logit lens method, which helps in understanding transformer models' decision-making, has been enhanced by breaking down logit outputs into contributions from various model components. This approach, which uses "prisms" for residual streams, attention layers, and MLP layers, reveals how these parts influence predictions and provides insights into tasks like factual retrieval and arithmetic performed by the gemma-2b model.

[### LLMs as Decision Makers (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12430v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Decision QA is a new task for LLMs that determines the best decisions based on complex data analysis.

[### How To Fix AI's ‚ÄúOriginal Sin‚Äù (20 minute read)](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/how-to-fix-ais-original-sin/?utm_source=tldrai)

This article addresses the copyright challenges posed by AI models trained on copyrighted material without permission. It suggests AI developers respect copyright signals, implement guardrails to prevent generating infringing content, and develop business models that ensure fair compensation for content creators, including techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and creating cooperative AI content ecosystems.

[### Nvidia passes Microsoft in market cap to become most valuable public company (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/nvidia-passes-microsoft-in-market-cap-is-most-valuable-public-company.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Nvidia is now the most valuable public company in the world. Its market cap surpassed Microsoft's $3.32 trillion on Tuesday, reaching a high of $3.34 trillion. Nvidia's shares are up more than 170% so far this year. Its market cap hit $3 trillion for the first time earlier this month. Nvidia's rise has been so rapid the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the stock benchmark of the 30 most valuable US companies.

[### Takeaways from OpenAI and Google's May announcements (5 minute read)](https://www.tanayj.com/p/takeaways-from-openai-and-googles?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI and Google have introduced advanced AI models that enable real-time multimodal understanding and responses and promise improved AI assistants and innovations in voice agents.
