### Headlines & Launches

[### Microsoft releases powerful new Phi-3.5 models, beating Google, OpenAI, and more (4 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-releases-powerful-new-phi-3-5-models-beating-google-openai-and-more/?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft launched three new models in its Phi series: Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct, and Phi-3.5-vision-instruct, each addressing different AI tasks with impressive benchmark performances. These models are open source under the MIT License and available for developers on Hugging Face. Despite their smaller size compared to some counterparts, the Phi models have achieved near-state-of-the-art results, surpassing competitors like GPT-4o and Llama in certain benchmarks.

[### AGI Safety and Alignment at Google DeepMind (20 minute read)](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/79BPxvSsjzBkiSyTq/agi-safety-and-alignment-at-google-deepmind-a-summary-of?utm_source=tldrai)

Google DeepMind's AGI Safety & Alignment team shared a detailed update on their work focused on existential risk from AI. Key areas include amplified oversight, frontier safety, and mechanistic interpretability, with ongoing efforts to refine their approach to technical AGI safety. They highlighted recent achievements, collaborations, and plans to address emerging challenges.

[### What's really going on in machine learning (28 minute read)](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/08/whats-really-going-on-in-machine-learning-some-minimal-models/?utm_source=tldrai)

Stephen Wolfram, the creator of Wolfram|Alpha, wrote a great exploration about different phenomena going on in machine learning models. He discovered a set of dynamics about the non-linearities in simple neural networks.

### Research & Innovation

[### Time Series Representation Learning with Diffusion Models (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05959v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Time Series Diffusion Embedding (TSDE) is the first diffusion-based approach for time series representation learning. TSDE segments time series data and uses dual-orthogonal Transformer encoders with a crossover mechanism to generate informative embeddings.

[### Energy-Efficient Autonomous Driving with Spiking Neural Networks (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19687v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Spiking Autonomous Driving (SAD) is the first unified Spiking Neural Network (SNN) aimed at addressing the energy challenges of autonomous driving.

[### Efficient Language Model Training (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08634v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Inheritune is a streamlined method for developing smaller base language models from larger ones by inheriting a few transformer blocks and training on a tiny fraction (0.1%) of the original data. This approach enabled the creation of a 1.5B parameter model using only an A6000 GPU in less than half a day, achieving results that compete well against larger models trained on significantly more data.

[### Teaching chat models to solve chess (28 minute read)](https://raw.sh/posts/chess_puzzles?utm_source=tldrai)

Traditional base language models are quite good at playing chess, averaging around 1800 elo. However, chat models tend to struggle with a precipitous drop in performance. This post explores how to tune chat models like GPT-4o to play chess through a combination of prompting and fine-tuning.

[### Data Exfiltration from Slack AI via indirect prompt injection (7 minute read)](https://promptarmor.substack.com/p/data-exfiltration-from-slack-ai-via?utm_source=tldrai)

A vulnerability in Slack AI was discovered where attackers can exfiltrate data from private channels they aren't members of via indirect prompt injection. It allows attackers to use public channel messages to manipulate the LLM into divulging private information, such as API keys, in query responses. This issue, alongside a phishing attack vector, persists even after Slack AI's August 14th update incorporating channel and DM files, significantly expanding the risk surface area for such exploits.
