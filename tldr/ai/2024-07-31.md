### Research & Innovation

[### Theia: Distilling Diverse Vision Foundation Models for Robot Learning (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20179?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces Theia, a vision foundation model for robot learning that integrates multiple existing vision models. Theia offers rich visual representations, enhancing robot learning with less training data and smaller model sizes. Experiments show that Theia outperforms its predecessors, and the authors suggest that higher entropy in feature norms improves performance. The code and models are available for public use.

[### SaulLM-54B & SaulLM-141B: Scaling Up Domain Adaptation for the Legal Domain (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19584?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces SaulLM-54B and SaulLM-141B, two large language models designed for the legal sector that feature 54 billion and 141 billion parameters. Using the Mixtral architecture, the researchers employed large-scale domain adaptation through continued pre-training with a vast legal corpus, a specialized legal instruction-following protocol, aligning outputs with human legal interpretations. The models outperform previous open-source models on LegalBench-Instruct and offer state-of-the-art performance. Base, instruct, and aligned versions of these models have been released under the MIT License for reuse and collaborative research.
