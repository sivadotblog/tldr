[### Replacing code with context: Using LLMs to judge query intent in online shopping (Sponsor)](https://resources.algolia.com/ebooks/ebook-code-replacing-code?utm_campaign=tldr_global_wnet_ecomm_reach&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_content=tldr_global_wnet&amp;utm_term=ebo_codereplacingcode&amp;utm_camp_parent=wnet&amp;utm_2nd_camp=ecomm&amp;utm_region=global&amp;utm_goal=reach&amp;utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&amp;utm_model=cpm&amp;utm_marketing_tactic=reach)

Which products should a user see when they search for ‚Äúgaming computer‚Äù? The answer used to depend on code, a series of rule-based algorithms and calculations. With LLMs, we're entering an era where [code matters less than context](https://resources.algolia.com/ebooks/ebook-code-replacing-code?utm_campaign=tldr_global_wnet_ecomm_reach&utm_medium=display&utm_source=tldr&utm_content=tldr_global_wnet&utm_term=ebo_codereplacingcode&utm_camp_parent=wnet&utm_2nd_camp=ecomm&utm_region=global&utm_goal=reach&utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&utm_model=cpm&utm_marketing_tactic=reach).

In this new paradigm, AI systems can adapt in real time, and [RAG pipelines give instant insight into user intent](https://resources.algolia.com/ebooks/ebook-code-replacing-code?utm_campaign=tldr_global_wnet_ecomm_reach&utm_medium=display&utm_source=tldr&utm_content=tldr_global_wnet&utm_term=ebo_codereplacingcode&utm_camp_parent=wnet&utm_2nd_camp=ecomm&utm_region=global&utm_goal=reach&utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&utm_model=cpm&utm_marketing_tactic=reach). Data drives development, and products become better through better context, not code.

[### AI As Profoundly Abnormal Technology (58 minute read)](https://blog.ai-futures.org/p/ai-as-profoundly-abnormal-technology?utm_source=tldrai)

AI technology will experience a profound jump in capabilities within the next decade. While some groups predict that AI adoption will be slow due to concerns about safety and other barriers to progress, the technology seems to be advancing very quickly. Control without alignment may not be sufficient to mitigate risk. Developers should prepare for risks that aren't immediate, as doing otherwise would be irresponsible.

[### Budgeting for AI in Your Startup (2 minute read)](https://tomtunguz.com/ai-rd-percent/?utm_source=tldrai)

Startups should allocate 10-15% of their R&D budget to AI, as engineer salaries average $200k and AI tools cost about $30k per year. AI adoption varies, with AI-native startups potentially spending more. Companies should adjust as AI becomes more integrated into operations.

[### The Three Layers of ROI for AI Agents (4 minute read)](https://www.henrypray.com/writings/the-three-layers-of-roi-for-ai-agents?utm_source=tldrai)

This post discusses a three-layer framework for determining where the ROI for AI agents comes from. The first layer is labor efficiency - while this layer is easy to explain, developers need to understand that AI efficiency doesn't equal immediate realized ROI. The second layer is net-new revenue, the backlog of stuff businesses never did until AI that create new value. The final layer is optimization - AI models bring decision fluency and ML brings decision precision, which creates value.
