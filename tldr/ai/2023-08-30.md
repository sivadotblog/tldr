### Research & Innovation

[### Simplifying Memory Use in Transfer Learning (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14316?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have found a way to make transfer learning methods use less memory with a new approach called "Universal Parallel Tuning" (UniPT). This makes it easier to use these advanced methods in everyday situations.

[### Flexible techniques for rendering with 3D Gaussian (8 minute read)](https://leonidk.com/fmb-plus/?utm_source=tldrai)

What do you get when you take a cell phone video and a few seconds on a CPU? Well, in this case - state of the art shape reconstruction! Slightly different from Gaussian splatting, but using the same fundamental math, this technique is a cool step forward in accessible 3D shape capture.

[### Enhancing Security in Models Using Diffusion (29 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14333v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers are exploring if "diffusion models" can make models that are already trained to be robust even stronger. A new method, "DiffSmooth", cleans up data using diffusion and then uses a special smoothing process to make the models even more reliable.

### Engineering & Resources

[### LangFuse (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse?utm_source=tldrai)

Langfuse is an open source observability & analytics solution for LLM-based applications. It is mostly geared towards production usage but some users also use it for local development of their LLM applications.

[### Adaptive computation reading list (17 minute read)](https://github.com/koayon/awesome-adaptive-computation?utm_source=tldrai)

Adaptive computation is the idea that a model can choose how much computation (e.g. how many parameters to use) to use for a given task. These can include search-based sampling methods or mixture of expert models. This reading list is actively maintained and extremely thorough.

[### DSPy (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy?utm_source=tldrai)

DSPy unifies techniques for prompting and fine-tuning LMs as well as improving them with reasoning and tool/retrieval augmentation, all expressed through a minimalistic set of Pythonic modules that compose and learn.

### Miscellaneous

[### Multi-turn chat models are hard to choose (Hugging Face model)](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/codellama-13b-oasst-sft-v10?utm_source=tldrai)

Many benchmarks don't accurately capture the full capabilities of language models. The unfortunate truth is model evaluation is increasingly vibes-based. The community sentiment is that this open assistant model is one of the best turn-based chat models available.

[### Llama 2 Is As Accurate At Summarizing Articles As GPT-4 (10 minute read)](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/llama-2-is-about-as-factually-accurate-as-gpt-4-for-summaries-and-is-30x-cheaper?utm_source=tldrai)

Llama-2-70b has been found to be almost as strong at factuality as GPT-4, and considerably better than gpt-3.5-turbo, all while being significantly cheaper.

[### AI in Education (16 minute read)](https://www.educationnext.org/a-i-in-education-leap-into-new-era-machine-intelligence-carries-risks-challenges-promises?utm_source=tldrai)

This article explores the potential of generative AI models like ChatGPT to transform education through customized tutoring, adaptive lessons, and administrative support. It discusses implications for teaching and policy but stresses the need for human oversight to maximize benefits and limit risks.
