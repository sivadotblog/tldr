### Miscellaneous

[### How to Build a Truly Useful AI Product (10 minute read)](https://every.to/thesis/how-to-build-a-truly-useful-ai-product?utm_source=tldrai)

Building AI startups requires adapting quickly to rapid advancements in LLMs, avoiding problems that upcoming models will solve, and leveraging high costs of cutting-edge technology for a competitive edge. Focus narrowly on specific use cases to compete with general-purpose AI while emphasizing a seamless product experience. Despite the fast-paced nature of generative AI, the core principles of creating desirable products remain unchanged.

[### Task-Specific LLM Evals that Do & Don't Work (30 minute read)](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/evals/?utm_source=tldrai)

Off-the-shelf evaluations often fail to effectively measure LLM performance for specific tasks. Useful metrics for classification include recall, precision, ROC-AUC, while summarization and translation can employ NLI-based consistency checks and chrF or BLEURT, respectively. Consider potential defects like copyright regurgitation and toxicity in models, using tests such as RealToxicityPrompts for comprehensive evaluation.

[### o1 Turns Pro (14 minute read)](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/o1-turns-pro?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's o1 and o1 Pro update offers significant improvements in coding, math, and complex problem-solving capabilities, with particularly strong performance in deep reasoning and fact recall. The $200/month o1 Pro service further enhances these features with additional compute power, proving especially valuable for those tackling specialized or challenging tasks. While reactions are generally positive, most users might find the $20/month tier sufficient unless facing advanced requirements.
