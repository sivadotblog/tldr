### Headlines & Launches

[### Anthropic launches Claude (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/anthropic-launches-claude-a-chatbot-to-rival-openais-chatgpt/?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic, one of OpenAI‚Äôs main rivals, launched Claude, a chatbot rival to ChatGPT. Anthropic was co-founded by ex-OpenAI employees. Claude can be instructed to perform a range of tasks, including searching across documents, summarizing, writing and coding, and answering questions about particular topics. But Anthropic makes the case that Claude is ‚Äúmuch less likely to produce harmful outputs,‚Äù ‚Äúeasier to converse with‚Äù and ‚Äúmore steerable‚Äù than OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT.

[### OpenAI releases GPT-4 (12 minute read)](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4?utm_source=tldrai)

It‚Äôs finally here! GPT-4 is a smarter, safer, and more robust version of its predecessor. GPT-4 is safer and more aligned, but still has limitations. It is 82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5 based on internal evaluations. Companies like Duolingo, Khan Academy, and Stripe are already using the service. Also, a correction from yesterday‚Äôs newsletter: previous rumors that GPT-4 will include text-to-video capabilities are actually not true. GPT-4 has not yet made the leap to multimodal outputs like video, but it can take in both video and text as inputs!

[### Google unveils new PaLM API and MakerSuite tool (3 minute read)](https://blog.google/technology/ai/ai-developers-google-cloud-workspace/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google has announced the PaLM API, a new offering that allows developers to experiment with large language models in a safe and easy way. Along with the API, they are releasing MakerSuite, a tool that enables developers to quickly and easily prototype generative AI applications. The tools will be available through a Private Preview to select developers, with a waitlist expected to follow. This announcement signifies Google's commitment to making AI accessible and empowering developers to build the next generation of applications.

[### New Pre-training Paradigm Improves Language Models' Capabilities (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07295?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper proposes a new pre-training paradigm that improves the training data efficiency and capabilities of language models in the infilling task. The paradigm includes a bidirectional training objective that aligns the predictions of left-to-right and right-to-left LMs and a bidirectional inference procedure. The approach is evaluated on programming and natural language models and outperforms strong baselines.

[### Model-tuning Via Prompts: Improving Adversarial Robustness in NLP (15 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07320?utm_source=tldrai)

The MVP method demonstrates surprising gains in adversarial robustness, improving performance against adversarial word-level synonym substitutions by an average of 8% over standard methods, and even outperforming state-of-art defenses by 3.5%. By modifying the input with a prompt template instead of modifying the model by appending an MLP head, MVP achieves better results in downstream tasks while maintaining clean accuracy.

[### Microsoft has laid off one of its responsible AI teams (8 minute read)](https://www.platformer.news/p/microsoft-just-laid-off-one-of-its?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft laid off its entire ethics and society team within the artificial intelligence organization as part of recent layoffs that affected 10,000 employees across the company, Platformer has learned. The move leaves Microsoft without a dedicated team to ensure its AI principles are closely tied to product design at a time when the company is leading the charge to make AI tools available to the mainstream, current and former employees said.
