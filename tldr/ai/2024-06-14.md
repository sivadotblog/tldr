Apple and OpenAI have forged a partnership to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT into iOS. The agreement was a key focus for Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference. The partnership is likely a short- to medium-term relationship for Apple, which is developing its own AI features. Apple is still in talks with Google about using Gemini in its devices. The company is also looking beyond chatbots - it is currently working on a mobile robot that can follow users around and handle chores on their behalf and AI features for its AirPods and cameras.

### Research & Innovation

[### LLM-Squared (6 minute read)](https://sakana.ai/llm-squared/?utm_source=tldrai)

Sakana AI has employed an evolutionary strategy to find a preference optimization scheme that outperforms DPO. It used a language model to suggest code and then trained models based on that code. After 100 or so generations, it had several proposed variants with extremely high performance.

[### Creating Immersive Audio (2 minute read)](https://masonlwang.com/hearinganythinganywhere/?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces DiffRIR, a new framework designed to reconstruct the spatial acoustic characteristics of environments using a small number of room impulse response (RIR) recordings and a planar scene reconstruction.

[### Recaptioning billions of images with Llama 3 (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08478?utm_source=tldrai)

Recaptioning web scraped images with a vision model dramatically improves downstream model performance. This is especially true in models such as CLIP.
