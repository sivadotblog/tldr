[### AlphaCodium Outperforms Direct Prompting of o1 Model (10 minute read)](https://www.qodo.ai/blog/system-2-thinking-alphacodium-outperforms-direct-prompting-of-openai-o1/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's o1 model, which exhibits System 1.5 thinking, shows enhanced reasoning capabilities compared to previous LLMs but still falls short of full System 2 deliberate problem-solving. AlphaCodium significantly improves o1's coding performance by providing a structured framework that guides reasoning and iterative refinement, achieving better accuracy on Codeforces benchmarks. While o1 and AlphaCodium together show promise in advancing AI toward deeper reasoning, much work remains to integrate full System 2 thinking in AI models.
