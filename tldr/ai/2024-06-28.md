[### Apple, Microsoft Shrink AI Models to Improve Them (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/small-language-models-apple-microsoft?utm_source=tldrai)

Tech giants are shifting focus from large language models to more efficient small language models (SLMs), with Apple and Microsoft introducing models with substantially fewer parameters yet comparable, or even superior, performance in benchmarks. OpenAI's CEO suggests we're moving beyond the era of LLMs, as SLMs offer advantages like local device operation, increased accessibility for smaller entities, and potential insights into human language acquisition. Training SLMs on high-quality or "textbook-quality" data contributes to their effectiveness despite their smaller scale.
