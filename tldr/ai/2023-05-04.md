### Headlines & Launches

[### Inflection AI, Startup From Ex-DeepMind Leaders, Launches Pi ‚Äî A Chattier Chatbot (8 minute read)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/05/02/inflection-ai-ex-deepmind-launches-pi-chatbot/?utm_source=tldrai)

Inflection AI's new chatbot, Pi, offers a more personal and conversational experience than its competitors, with the ability to remember past interactions and help users with various tasks. Launched today by CEO Mustafa Suleyman, Pi aims to be an "active listener" and will eventually assist in organizing schedules, prepping for meetings, and learning new skills. While the AI market is already saturated with chatbots, Inflection AI, backed by $225 million in funding, hopes to stand out with a focus on providing a personal AI that is "singularly aligned to your interests."

### Research & Innovation

[### Unlimiformer: Long-Range Transformers with Unlimited Length Input (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01625?utm_source=tldrai)

Unlimiformer is a new method that can work with any transformer-based model, making it possible to handle really long input text without limits. This cool technique improves models like BART and Longformer, allowing them to summarize super long texts, even entire books, without cutting anything out.

[### GPT4 excels at causal reasoning (50 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00050?utm_source=tldrai)

We know that correlation is not causation, but do models trained to find correlations uncover causations? It turns out they may be able to! On a number of interesting benchmarks, including causal discovery, and causal reasoning, the recent set of OpenAI models are surprisingly capable. However, they also show really surprising and somewhat non-intuitive failure modes which means we still have a way to go

[### Everyone is excited about small models, but can they catch up? (12 minute read)](https://yaofu.notion.site/Towards-Complex-Reasoning-the-Polaris-of-Large-Language-Models-c2b4a51355b44764975f88e6a42d4e75?utm_source=tldrai)

Large language models tend to reason better than small models. This reasoning helps solve hard tasks and may allow language models to serve as the foundation for the next-generation computation platform/operating system. Training on code, chain of thought prompting, and RL all tend to improve reasoning ability. The question then becomes if these techniques can bridge the gap between smaller and larger models

[### Pick-a-Pic: An Open Dataset of User Preferences for Text-to-Image Generation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/yuvalkirstain/PickScore?utm_source=tldrai)

A web app called Pick-a-Pic was created to let people generate images and share their preferences, making a big, open dataset for training a super smart scoring system called PickScore. PickScore is great at predicting what people like and works better than other methods for evaluating text-to-image models, so it's recommended for future use.

[### Text-to-Motion Retrieval (3 minute read)](%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://mathis.petrovich.fr/tmr/?utm_source=tldrai)

TMR is a new method that helps find 3D human motions based on text, improving on previous techniques. It works really well and even reduces the median rank from 54 to 19, making it much better at matching motions to text descriptions.
