### Headlines & Launches

[### Copilot Workspace (4 minute read)](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace/?utm_source=tldrai)

GitHub has announced a new project to allow language models to somewhat autonomously finish features and fix bugs.

[### Effort Engine (3 minute read)](https://kolinko.github.io/effort?utm_source=tldrai)

Effort enables real-time adjustment of computations during LLM model inference on Apple Silicon chips, striking a balance between speed and quality. The method, which requires no retraining but requires conversion and precomputation, allows models to operate faster by loading fewer weights. The developers are seeking assistance from Swift/Metal engineers to optimize the implementation, which is available for download on GitHub.

[### OpenAI Introduces ‚ÄúMemory‚Äù Feature For ChatGPT Plus Users (2 minute read)](https://the-decoder.com/openai-introduces-memory-feature-for-chatgpt-plus-users/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has launched a new "Memory" feature for ChatGPT Plus users, allowing the AI to retain information across conversations, which can be managed via settings.
