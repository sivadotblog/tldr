[### I want to break some laws too (20 minute read)](https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/breaking_some_laws.html?utm_source=tldrai)

This article discusses using an automated pipeline for data cleaning, inspired by the Minipile method, which pruned datasets to achieve significant performance results with a fraction of the original data size. By employing techniques like few-shot prompting and clustering, the approach streamlines dataset refinement for AI training, breaking traditional scaling laws by focusing on data quality over quantity. The findings suggest that foundational datasets with more refined data can optimize AI model training, reducing resource consumption while enhancing performance.
