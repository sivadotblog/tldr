### Research & Innovation

[### How to erase Harry Potter from Llama 2 (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02238?utm_source=tldrai)

LLMs have been trained on massive amounts of data, much of which is copyright protected. Removing or unlearning such data is a challenge. This work uses a proxy model as a teacher to simulate a clean model and further fine-tunes the base model, which reduces knowledge of undesirable information while maintaining benchmark performance.

[### Boosting Vision Transformers for Flexible Image Resolutions (11 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04134v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers present a solution, called Multi-Head Self-Attention Convolution (MSA-Conv), which allows Vision Transformers (ViTs) to handle images of different sizes without needing changes in their design or the need to resize images.

[### Setting New Standards in Blind Super-Resolution (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04180v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study introduces a novel Transformer model that is tailored to blind super-resolution, a task that deals with images with unknown noise. The method outshines current approaches through its blend of traditional CNNs and a new Transformer design attuned to degradation patterns.

### Engineering & Resources

[### 😘 Kiss bugs goodbye with fully automated end-to-end test coverage (Sponsor)](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=KissBugGoodbye10102023&amp;utm_source=tldrai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter)

If you've tried to build automated test coverage in-house, you know it takes years to scale. Try [QA Wolf](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=KissBugGoodbye10102023&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter) instead - they get web apps to 80% test coverage in just 4 months. They will create and maintain your test suite in open-source Playwright (no vendor lock-in, you own the code), and provide unlimited parallel test runs on their infrastructure.

The best part: QA Wolf saves you money. QA Wolf has multiple case studies of customers saving at least $200k/year in QA engineering and infrastructure costs. [Schedule a demo](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=KissBugGoodbye10102023&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter) to learn more.

[### Simplex random feature attention (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/notarussianteenager/srf-attention?utm_source=tldrai)

Attention is useful but computationally expensive. However, once trained, with a bit of fine-tuning compute you can drop in SRF attention and remove the dependence on sequence length, speeding things up considerably.

[### LeptonAI (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/leptonai/leptonai?utm_source=tldrai)

A Pythonic framework to simplify AI service building.

[### Making CNNs Shine in Federated Learning (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ucsc-vlaa/fedconv?utm_source=tldrai)

This study delves into how different architectural elements in machine learning models affect their performance in federated learning, especially when handling varied data sources. Through in-depth analysis, researchers found that with certain tweaks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can perform as well or even better than Vision Transformers in such settings.

[### How to lose at Generative AI (4 minute read)](https://platforms.substack.com/p/how-to-lose-at-generative-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

Great read on the tricky parts of creating value around generative AI for startups. While the incumbents are favored, finding your path and creating real value early is where startups can have a fighting chance.

[### AI Isn’t A Drill, And Your Users Don’t Want Holes (2 minute read)](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/10/ai-isnt-a-drill-and-your-users-dont-want-holes/?utm_source=tldrai)

AI is often misunderstood as a one-size-fits-all solution, but businesses need to recognize that it's merely a tool, and not every business requires it. Identifying genuine problems and needs should precede technology adoption, rather than trying to retrofit AI solutions where they may not be needed or beneficial.

[### How AMD might get across the CUDA moat (7 minute read)](https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/10/05/how-amd-may-get-across-the-cuda-moat/?utm_source=tldrai)

There is a heavy shortage of GPUs for the current AI demand. Many services have long queue times or are restricting access as a result. If other chip makers can overcome some of their software deficiencies, maybe via recent Pytorch improvements, they may be able to compete for some of this demand.
