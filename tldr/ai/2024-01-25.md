### Research & Innovation

[### DeepDive: Getting Started with Mechanistic Interpretability (30 minute read)](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/getting-started?utm_source=tldrai)

Neel Nanda is one of the pioneers of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI). This is his guide to getting into the field. It features 200 concrete open questions. MI is the study of the quantitative values of language models (e.g., actually looking at neurons). It is accessible as it doesn‚Äôt require significant computation, and is extremely promising as a research direction, although there has been minimal success to date.

[### Fuyu-Heavy multimodal model outperforms Gemini Pro (6 minute read)](https://www.adept.ai/blog/adept-fuyu-heavy?utm_source=tldrai)

Adept scaled up its Fuyu architecture and trained a larger version that is currently the 3rd best model on MMMU. The model also performs well on other tasks (e.g., achieving 40+ on HumanEval coding benchmark). There were fewer challenges with scaling this architecture than alternatives, in part due to its simplicity. However, there were still challenges with data i/o, memory bandwidth, and custom kernel development.

[### Boosting 3D Object Detection for Safer Autonomous Driving (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20234v1?utm_source=tldrai)

HEDNet is a new encoder-decoder network designed to enhance 3D object detection in autonomous vehicles, specifically addressing the challenge of sparse point distribution in 3D scenes.

[### Evaluation Metrics for LLM Applications In Production (7 minute read)](https://docs.parea.ai/blog/eval-metrics-for-llm-apps-in-prod?utm_source=tldrai)

This article discusses evaluation metrics that don't rely on ground truth data. It explores general-purpose as well as RAG, chatbot, and summarization-specific evaluations. All metrics come with a Python implementation.

[### If AI Were Conscious, How Would We Know? (7 minute read)](https://suzitravis.substack.com/p/if-ai-were-conscious-how-would-we?utm_source=tldrai)

The Turing Test and Searle's Chinese Room Thought Experiment are often cited in the discussion of AI consciousness, with the former testing if an AI's behavior is indistinguishable from a human's and the latter arguing that external behavior alone cannot prove consciousness. This debate highlights the difficulty in defining and recognizing consciousness in AI, as our understanding is primarily based on human experiences and functionalist approaches.
