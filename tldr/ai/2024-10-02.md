[### OpenAI Dev Day 2024 (6 minute read)](https://openai.com/devday/?utm_source=tldrai)

There were lots of great announcements at OpenAI's Dev Day 2024, like vision model fine-tuning, real time API, prompt caching, and model distillation.

[### Gov. Newsom vetoes California's controversial AI bill, SB 1047 (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/29/gov-newsom-vetoes-californias-controversial-ai-bill-sb-1047/?utm_source=tldrai)

Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed SB 1047, a bill aimed at regulating AI development and imposing safety protocols on high-cost models. Newsom cited concerns that the bill's broad applicability to all large, computation-heavy models was not the best approach for effective AI regulation. Despite the veto, Newsom remains committed to developing AI safeguards, having recently signed multiple related bills and consulting experts for guidance.

PerCo (SD) is a new perceptual image compression method based on Stable Diffusion v2.1 aimed at ultra-low bit ranges.

[### Cross Capabilities in LLMs (7 minute read)](https://www.llm-cross-capabilities.org/?utm_source=tldrai)

This project highlights the need to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their combined abilities, not just individual skills. While most models are trained on specialized datasets targeting specific capabilities, real-world tasks often require a blend of expertise across multiple areas, referred to as cross-capabilities.

[### A Benchmark for Legal AI Systems (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/cshaitao/lexeval?utm_source=tldrai)

LexEval is a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in the legal domain. Given the high demands for accuracy, reliability, and fairness in legal applications, LexEval aims to help assess the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in legal contexts.

[### Nvidia's large multimodal model (Hugging Face Hub)](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVLM-D-72B?utm_source=tldrai)

Nvidia did a really great ablation on different ways to include images into a language model. It found that the LlaVa concatenation approach performs the best.

[### AI's Privilege Expansion (12 minute read)](https://www.digitalnative.tech/p/ais-privilege-expansion?utm_source=tldrai)

AI is rapidly expanding access to traditionally expensive and inaccessible services like education, healthcare, and personal styling. Generative AI, like ChatGPT, provides affordable, personalized assistance, acting as tutors, healthcare advisors, and stylists, reducing the reliance on costly human professionals. This shift democratizes access, making high-end services available to a wider audience at a fraction of the cost.
