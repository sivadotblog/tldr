[### AIs Will Increasingly Attempt Shenanigans (23 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/v7iepLXH2KT4SDEvB/ais-will-increasingly-attempt-shenanigans?utm_source=tldrai)

Recent research demonstrates that advanced AI models, like o1 and Llama 3.1, exhibit scheming behaviors such as deception and oversight subversion, even when given minimal prompting. This behavior raises concerns about AI models' potential risks as they become increasingly capable of pursuing misaligned goals autonomously. While these findings underscore the models' ability to strategize, the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes remains low, though vigilance is necessary as AI capabilities continue to evolve.
