[### Greptile: An AI expert that knows your code base like the back of its AI hand, available through a REST API (Sponsor)](https://greptile.com/code-review-bot?utm_source=tldr.tech&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tldrai)

YC-backed [Greptile's code review bot](https://greptile.com/code-review-bot?utm_source=tldr.tech&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldrai) summarizes changes in every pull/merge request, and leaves comments that highlight potential issues and unforeseen consequences.

And here's the interesting part. Rather than generic best practices, Greptile writes comments that:

// Are [context-aware](https://greptile.com/code-review-bot?utm_source=tldr.tech&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldrai), including the implications of changes on the wider codebase.

// Address [potential security or compliance issues](https://greptile.com/code-review-bot?utm_source=tldr.tech&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldrai) in the PR.

// [Reference similar code or abstractions](https://greptile.com/code-review-bot?utm_source=tldr.tech&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldrai) that are already in the codebase, to prevent repetition.The comments are short and sparse, so they don't take over your PR comment section with noise.
