### Headlines & Launches

[### Dario Amondei on DeepSeek and Export Controls (15 minute read)](https://darioamodei.com/on-deepseek-and-export-controls?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic's CEO gives great insight into the DeepSeek models, cost curves, and innovation. He expertly lays out the landscape and points to flaws in the market reaction. Additionally, he reveals that Sonnet 3.5 only cost $10m or so dollars to train. The main point of the article is export controls.

[### OpenAI Accuses DeepSeek (4 minute read)](https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has found evidence that the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train an open-source competitor. The suspected "distillation" process allows smaller models to mimic larger ones at a lower cost, raising concerns over intellectual property breaches.

[### Zuckerberg Dismisses DeepSeek, Commits to AI Investment (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/zuck-shrugs-off-deepseek-vows-to-spend-hundreds-of-billions-on-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Mark Zuckerberg remains unfazed by competition from DeepSeek. He has reaffirmed Meta's commitment to massive AI investments and focus on model development and computational resources.

### Research & Innovation

[### Qwen 2.5 Max MoE Model (12 minute read)](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/?utm_source=tldrai)

The Qwen team has released its MoE earlier than expected. The model shows really strong performance, matching many top models, including DeepSeek v3.

[### Optimizing Large Language Model Training Using FP4 Quantization (30 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17116?utm_source=tldrai)

One of the key levers that can be pulled to reduce training and inference costs is quantization. Getting these models to run at lower precision saves on the number of GPUs and FLOPs needed for training. This work shows, on a small scale of 100B tokens, how to train at FP4.

[### Text-to-Video Generation with CascadeV (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16612v1?utm_source=tldrai)

CascadeV introduces a cascaded latent diffusion model that generates 2K-resolution videos with improved efficiency. It employs a novel 3D attention mechanism and can be integrated with existing text-to-video models to enhance resolution and frame rate without fine-tuning.
