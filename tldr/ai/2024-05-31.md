[### Your go-to electrolyte drink for cramps, headaches, and fatigue (Sponsor)](http://DrinkLMNT.com/TLDR)

It's not dehydration that's holding you back. It's overhydration.

When you drink too much water, you dilute your blood sodium levels. This causes headaches, muscle cramps, worse sleep, and hurts your overall performance ‚Äî whether at the gym or WFH.

Here's your alternative üëá

* [LMNT](https://drinklmnt.com/TLDR) is a science-backed [electrolyte drink mix](https://drinklmnt.com/TLDR) designed to support active hydration and a healthy lifestyle.
* Zero sugar. No artificial colors. No dodgy ingredients.
* Created by a former research biochemist and [used by the world's top performers](https://drinklmnt.com/TLDR).

[### Yuan 2.0-M32: Mixture of Experts with Attention Router (15 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17976?utm_source=tldrai)

Yuan 2.0-M32 is a Mixture of Experts model with 40B parameters, 3.7B active at any time. It performs close to Llama 3 70B despite using 1/19th the compute. It was trained on 2T tokens and seems surprisingly powerful for its size.

[### Ultra-HD Image Deraining (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17074v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have introduced a new dataset called 4K-Rain13k that features 13,000 pairs of 4K resolution images to tackle the challenge of deraining ultra-high-definition (UHD) images.

[### Scaling Laws and Compute-Optimal Training Beyond Fixed Training Durations (20 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18392?utm_source=tldrai)

The original scaling laws papers used a Cosine learning rate schedule which doesn't achieve optimal loss if the Cosine period isn't aligned with the total training steps. This makes it challenging to train enough models to create meaningful scaling laws. This paper introduces the idea of a constant learning rate with a cool down as a way to reduce GPU costs for scaling law creation.

[### AI won't eat your job, but it will eat your salary (10 minute read)](https://medium.com/@sanguit/ai-wont-eat-your-job-but-it-will-eat-your-salary-a810121d89e4?utm_source=tldrai)

AI threatens not just the existence of jobs but the skill premium associated with tasks, potentially reducing the wages for skilled labor. AI could re-bundle job tasks and lower the barriers to task performance, leading to commoditization and decreased ability to charge a premium salary. As AI evolves, especially through AI agents, managerial advantages may also diminish, challenging the human-in-the-loop advantage and further eroding skill premiums.
