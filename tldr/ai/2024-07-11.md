### Engineering & Resources

[### Paints UNDO generative model (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Paints-UNDO?utm_source=tldrai)

From the creator of ControlNet, IC-Light, and many other image generation systems, Paints UNDO is a system where a model creates strokes that are used to recreate an image. Interestingly, unlike previous stroke systems, this model can undo strokes and often rethinks its approach entirely part way through - very similarly to a human artist.

[### minRF (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/cloneofsimo/minRF?utm_source=tldrai)

Scalable Rectified Flow Transformers are used, in part, for Stable Diffusion 3. This repository is a minimal implementation of this that also includes muP hyperparameter sweeps.

[### RouteLLM (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM?utm_source=tldrai)

A framework for serving and evaluating LLM routers.

[### A Deep Dive on AI Inference Startups (8 minute read)](https://eastwind.substack.com/p/a-deep-dive-on-ai-inference-startups?utm_source=tldrai)

One popular area of VC investing is building the ‚Äúpicks and shovels‚Äù for AI (e.g. model fine-tuning, observability, and inference). VCs are betting that companies will not want to build things in-house as they add AI to their products. The TAM for AI inference is quite constrained. VCs need to believe in massive TAM expansion for their investments to pay off. While AI inference platforms are a boon for startups in the short term, they are detrimental to startups over longer periods.

[### Advancing 3D Perception in Autonomous Driving (38 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06190v1?utm_source=tldrai)

SuperFlow is a new framework that enhances 3D perception in autonomous driving by using consecutive LiDAR-camera pairs for spatiotemporal pretraining.

[### Cyclists can't decide whether to fear or love self-driving cars (8 minute read)](https://www.yahoo.com/news/cyclists-t-decide-whether-fear-220824589.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Cyclists in San Francisco have reported close encounters and safety concerns with Waymo's and Cruise's autonomous vehicles. Nearly 200 complaints have been made to the California DMV highlighting erratic driving and near-misses involving these self-driving cars. While the companies claim their vehicles have enhanced safety features, the incidents raise questions about their readiness for broader deployment amidst increased regulatory scrutiny.
