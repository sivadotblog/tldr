[### RustGPT (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/tekaratzas/RustGPT?utm_source=tldrai)

RustGPT is a complete large language model implementation in pure Rust with no external ML frameworks. The project demonstrates how to build a transformer-based language model from scratch in Rust. It was built from the ground up using only ndarray for matrix operations - no PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Candle. The model uses a transformer-based architecture.

[### Human Video from Text, Image, and Audio (4 minute read)](https://phantom-video.github.io/HuMo/?utm_source=tldrai)

HuMo unifies human-centric video generation across multimodal inputs by introducing a new dataset and a progressive training strategy, achieving audio-visual synchronization.

[### OpenAI Ramps Up Robotics Work in Race Toward AGI (6 minute read)](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ramps-up-robotics-work-in-race-toward-agi/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is hiring researchers with expertise in developing AI algorithms for controlling humanoid or other types of robots. The company appears to be putting together a team capable of creating systems that can be trained through teleoperation and simulation. It has begun training AI algorithms that are better able to make sense of the physical world to empower robots to navigate and perform tasks. Achieving artificial general intelligence may require developing algorithms capable of interacting with the physical world.

[### Nvidia's Rubin CPX could force AMD back to the drawing board (6 minute read)](https://the-decoder.com/nvidias-rubin-cpx-could-force-amd-back-to-the-drawing-board/?utm_source=tldrai)

Nvidia's Rubin CPX is a specialized accelerator built specifically for the 'prefill' stage of AI inference. It is tuned for dense compute with far less bandwidth than a general-purpose GPU. Rubin CPX uses less expensive GDDR7 memory and skips high-bandwidth features like HBM and NVLink, so it is estimated to cost around a quarter as much to manufacture as the standard Rubin R200. Its release may force industry rivals to rethink their hardware strategies or risk falling further behind Nvidia's lead in AI infrastructure.
