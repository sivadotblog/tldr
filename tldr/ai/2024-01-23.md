### Headlines & Launches

[### Stability AI Unveils Smaller, More Efficient 1.6B Language Model (3 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/stability-ai-unveils-smaller-more-efficient-1-6b-language-model-as-part-of-ongoing-innovation/?utm_source=tldrai)

Stability AI's latest release, Stable LM 2 1.6B, is a compact yet powerful language model that supports seven languages. It is designed to outperform other models under 2 billion parameters, including its own previous 3B model. With its smaller size, it aims to lower barriers for developers, offering various versions including a unique "half-cooked" model for more customization flexibility.

[### Tesla finally releases FSD v12 (2 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2024/01/22/tesla-releases-fsd-v12-last-hope-self-driving/?utm_source=tldrai)

Tesla has started rolling out its Full Self-Driving Beta v12 update, which shifts vehicle control from explicit C++ code to an AI-powered single neural network. The release marks a significant move towards fulfilling the company's self-driving ambitions, although the software is still labeled as beta. Skepticism will remain until tangible improvements in autonomous driving capabilities are observed as the software is rolled out to cautious select beta testers.

### Research & Innovation

[### Face Mixer Diffusion (18 minute read)](https://www.justinpinkney.com/blog/2024/face-mixer-diffusion/?utm_source=tldrai)

This work shows how you can use diffusion to clone faces in images. There are many ways to do this with deep fakes, but diffusion is interesting due to its ability to inpaint other pieces of the image as needed.

[### DeepDive: LoRA from Scratch (22 minute read)](https://lightning.ai/lightning-ai/studios/code-lora-from-scratch?utm_source=tldrai)

LoRAs are Low Rank Adapters that allow you to fine-tune only a small amount of parameters in a language model. They can dramatically improve and alter the performance of these models.

[### GroupAnything (12 minute read)](https://www.garfield.studio/?utm_source=tldrai)

Grouping in 3D is a challenging and ambiguous task because you don‚Äôt know what granularity you‚Äôll need for the grouping operation (e.g., keys on a keyboard vs the entire keyboard itself). This work uses multi-level masks and makes great progress on the problem of semantic 3D grouping.

[### Self-Rewarding Language Models (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/lucidrains/self-rewarding-lm-pytorch?utm_source=tldrai)

This project explores Self-Rewarding Language Models, where the model acts as its own judge to improve training. By using this method, researchers were able to enhance a model's performance, surpassing other systems like GPT-4.

[### Self-Improving AI Through Unique Data Selection (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ofa-sys/diverseevol?utm_source=tldrai)

DiverseEvol is a new method that lets an AI model choose its own training data to get better without needing help from people or other advanced AI systems.

[### Depth Anything for Depth Estimation (3 minute read)](https://depth-anything.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

Depth Anything is a new approach to monocular depth estimation that relies on a large-scale dataset of about 62 million images to improve its accuracy. By using data augmentation and auxiliary supervision from pre-trained encoders, this model achieves impressive generalization capabilities and sets new standards in depth estimation.

[### My AI Timelines Have Sped Up (Again) (13 minute read)](https://www.alexirpan.com/2024/01/10/ai-timelines-2024.html?utm_source=tldrai)

This author revised their AI timeline predictions based on advancements in scaling up models. They are now estimating a 10% chance of achieving Artificial General Intelligence by 2028 and a 50% chance by 2045. These changes are attributed to the effectiveness of large language models and the realization that many intelligent capabilities may emerge at scale.
