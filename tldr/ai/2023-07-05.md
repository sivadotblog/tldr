### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI turns off ChatGPT Browsing feature (2 minute read)](https://decrypt.co/147300/openai-disables-web-browse-bing-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrai)

Despite complaints from ChatGPT Plus subscribers who benefited from the feature, OpenAI has temporarily disabled "Browse with Bing" on its ChatGPT service, citing concerns that the AI was inadvertently bypassing paywalls and privacy settings. OpenAI insists this move was made to respect content ownership rights, with a return of the browsing feature planned after necessary adjustments.

[### Why Transformative AI Is Really, Really Hard To Achieve (21 minute read)](https://zhengdongwang.com/2023/06/27/why-transformative-ai-is-really-really-hard-to-achieve.html?utm_source=tldrai)

While humans have a good track record of innovation, the trend growth rate of GDP per capita has never exceeded three percent per year. There has yet to be a technology that breaks the three percent threshold. Only strong evidence should cause us to expect anything different. AI is likely transformative in the same way that the internet was, but it has many hurdles in the way to the accelerating growth rates predicted by some.

[### What the European AI Act Means for You, AI Developer (11 minute read)](https://encord.com/blog/what-the-european-ai-act-means-for-you/?utm_source=tldrai)

The EU AI Act is the world's first legislation on artificial intelligence, similar to GDPR but for AI. It introduces definitions for 'foundation models' and 'general-purpose AI systems' and sets out dos and don'ts for AI practices. The Act also focuses on trustworthy AI development and includes obligations for high-risk AI systems. The legislation is currently going through final negotiations before enforcement.

### Research & Innovation

[### A Faster, Smarter Way to Inpaint Pictures (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00407v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Imagine having a tool that can fill in missing parts of a picture quickly and accurately - that's what the WavePaint model does! It uses something called a WaveMix-based architecture to mend images, working faster and needing fewer steps than current methods.

[### Predicting Suicide Risk: A Multi-Task Learning Approach (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00995v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This research introduces a new model to predict suicide risk in people with bipolar disorder. The model uses symptoms found in these posts to understand which are most influential in predicting future suicide risk, helping doctors to better understand these patients and provide timely help.

[### Machine learning for polynomial equations (37 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00252?utm_source=tldrai)

Solving systems of polynomial equations sometimes results in singularities which are poorly behaved points. There are certain resolution strategies which allow for solutions at these points. Resolution is a challenging process, but if you frame it as a game and apply RL, you can achieve impressive performance.

S.A.T.U.R.D.A.Y provides tools to build elegant vocal interfaces to modern LLMs.

[### Real latent image editing (HuggingFace space)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/editing-images/ledits?utm_source=tldrai)

There's been a meme going around amongst AI researchers about turning them all into Tom Cruise. This space that lets you turn yourself into Tom Cruise easily by using latent image editing with DDPM models. It seems to work better on faces than on objects.

[### Hyperdimensional Computing Reimagines AI (13 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-approach-to-computation-reimagines-artificial-intelligence-20230413/?utm_source=tldrai)

A new approach to computation called hypervectors is being explored as a way to improve artificial intelligence. Hypervectors are large vectors that represent concepts. They can be used to reason about the world in a more abstract and efficient way than traditional methods.

[### AI, Ozymandias (15 minute read)](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/ai-or-the-eternal-recurrence-of-hubris?utm_source=tldrai)

In the late 19th century, there was a widespread belief that human knowledge was nearing completion. This was due to rapid progress in science and technology, particularly in physics and biology. However, this confidence was misplaced, as new discoveries soon overturned many of the old assumptions. Freddie DeBoer argues that we are currently seeing a similar recurrence of hubris in AI. While AI has achieved impressive results in recent years, it is important to remember that it is still a very young field with much that we do not understand. We should be wary of making grandiose claims about AI's potential, as we may eventually be proven wrong in the same way that the late Victorians were.
