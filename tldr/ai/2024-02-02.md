[### New state of the art in open embedding model (HuggingFace Hub)](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-m3?utm_source=tldrai)

The BGE-M3 project introduces a versatile embedding model that excels in Multi-Functionality (dense, multi-vector, and sparse retrieval), Multi-Linguality (supporting over 100 languages), and Multi-Granularity (handling inputs from short sentences to documents up to 8192 tokens). It uses a hybrid retrieval pipeline that combines different methods and re-ranking for higher accuracy and generalization, leveraging its ability to perform embedding and sparse retrieval simultaneously.

[### Hierarchical Text Segmentation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ymy-k/hi-sam?utm_source=tldrai)

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been enhanced to create Hi-SAM, a model specializing in hierarchical text segmentation. Hi-SAM excels in segmenting text across multiple levels - from strokes to paragraphs - and even performs layout analysis.

[### RAGs (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/run-llama/rags?utm_source=tldrai)

RAGs is a Streamlit app that lets users create RAG pipelines from data sources using natural language. Users just have to describe the tasks and parameters they want from their RAG systems. The RAG can be queried and it will answer questions over the data.
