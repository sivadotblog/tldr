AI is pretty good at creating bugs. Can it also resolve them?

Seer is Sentry's new AI agent ‚Äî and the only AI agent that [uses all of the context that Sentry provides](https://sentry.io/product/seer/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=seer-fy26q2-seerlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-seer-page-learnmore): errors, stack traces, commit history, logs, traces, spans, breadcrumbs.

Seer sifts through the data, finds the root cause of an issue (with 94.5% accuracy!), and can open a PR with a fix. Ship it, close the tab, and move on with your life. It's private by default, supports ¬±any stack, and it actually works.

[Watch Seer work its magic](https://sentry.io/resources/sentry-build/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=ai-fy26q2-aiworkshop&utm_content=newsletter-ai-workshop-rsvp) and learn how the Sentry engineering team uses Seer to automatically debug issues.

[### What We Learned Trying to Diff Base and Chat Models And Why It Matters (10 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xmpauEXEerzYcJKNm/what-we-learned-trying-to-diff-base-and-chat-models-and-why?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers compared raw AI models with their chat-trained versions to understand what safety training actually changes inside the model‚Äîlike finding the "off-limits" neurons that make a model refuse harmful requests. They discovered that Anthropic's standard comparison technique was hallucinating thousands of fake differences, but their BatchTopK fix revealed real interpretable safety circuits like refusal detection and stereotype filtering, capturing 88% of behavioral changes versus just 60% for the broken method.
