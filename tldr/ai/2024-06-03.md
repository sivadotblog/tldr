[### Random Color Erasing Boosts Model Robustness in Computer Vision (9 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10512v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a new learning strategy called Random Color Erasing to tackle color bias in computer vision. This method balances the importance of color and other features by selectively removing color information from training data, leading to models that perform better in complex scenarios like wide-area surveillance and industrial applications.

[### muP for Sparse Models (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15743?utm_source=tldrai)

muP is a powerful tool used by all frontier model labs to transfer hyper parameters tuned on small models to larger, more expensive training runs. This paper explores how to do that for sparse models, thus dramatically improving training performance while reducing compute costs.
