Is your team exploring MCP integrations?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly emerging as the go-to standard for connecting LLMs to external tools and data. But as adoption picks up, many teams are implementing MCP without a clear security playbook.

[This practical guide](https://www.wiz.io/lp/inside-mcp-security-a-research-guide-on-emerging-risks?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_medium=paid-email&utm_campaign=FY26Q2_INB_FORM_MCP-Security-Research-Guide-Emerging-Risks&sfcid=701Py00000PcNI9IAN&utm_term=FY26Q3-tldr-ai-nl&utm_content=MCP-Security-Guide) breaks down real-world MCP security risks and offers actionable steps to help teams secure LLM integrations.

Inside the guide:

* Key risks with local and remote MCP servers
* Real-world threats like prompt injection and supply chain compromise
* Actionable steps for safely using MCP tools
