### Headlines & Launches

[### Sourcegraph‚Äôs Open Source Code Model (11 minute read)](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/open-sourcing-cody?utm_source=tldrai)

Every platform is making an AI play and with the sunsetting of Codex, it is nice to have a powerful model available for code generation. It‚Äôs not clear where the weights are, but with the code being open from a large open source friendly organization it is a good sign towards language model availability. The model has additional capabilities around question answering and generating code according to your company‚Äôs coding standards.

[### GPT-4 wrote a 115 page book (12 minute read)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/120oq1x/i_asked_gpt4_to_write_a_book_the_result_echoes_of/?utm_source=tldrai)

The goal of this project was to have GPT-4 generate an entire novel from scratch, including the title, genre, story, characters, settings, and all the writing, with no human input. It is impossible currently to do this using a single prompt, but what is possible is to supply a series of prompts that give structure to the process and allow it to complete this large task, one step at a time. However, in order to ensure that all the creative work is done by GPT-4, prompts are not allowed to make specific references to the content of the book, only the book‚Äôs structure. The intention is that the process should be simple, mechanical and possible (in principle) to fully automate. You can read the book for free, it won‚Äôt win any awards, but it is a fascinating glimpse into the creative future of AI generated content.

[### Interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang About AI‚Äôs iPhone Moment (25 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2023/an-interview-with-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-about-ais-iphone-moment/?utm_source=tldrai)

Author Ben Thompson interviews Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on what he calls AI‚Äôs iPhone moment ‚Äî ChatGPT ‚Äî and how that has affected Nvidia‚Äôs business. When asked what Nvidia is doing differently post-ChatGPT, Huang said ‚ÄúInference. The inference, the scale of inference business has gone through a step function, no doubt, and the type of inference that is being done right now where you know that video will have generative AI added to it to augment the video either to enhance the background, enhance the subject, relight the face, do eye reposing, augment with fun graphics, so on and so forth. All of that generative AI work is done in the cloud and so video has generative AI.‚Äù

[### Make-It-3D: High-Fidelity 3D Creation from A Single Image with Diffusion Prior (10 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14184?utm_source=tldrai)

"Make-It-3D" is a new approach that creates high-quality 3D content from a single image by leveraging prior knowledge from a well-trained 2D diffusion model to act as 3D-aware supervision. The approach outperforms prior works and enables various applications such as text-to-3D creation and texture editing.

[### LLMs are not great uncertain agent simulators (17 minute read)](https://www.danieldjohnson.com/2023/03/27/uncertain_simulators/?utm_source=tldrai)

‚ÄúThe hallucination problem‚Äù is really a problem of uncertainty estimation and calibration. Language models are great at simulating agents, but often those agents (people who wrote stuff online) have access to privileged information that the LLM does not. This means the language model is simulating an agent without full information, which leads to uncertainty. There are ways around this, but it is potentially the next big open problem in language modeling.

[### BlenderGPT (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/gd3kr/BlenderGPT?utm_source=tldrai)

Blender is a popular, free, and open source 3d modeling software. It is extremely powerful and conveniently has a Python interface. You can hook this interface up to language models such as GPT-4 and have them write code for you to automate different 3d modeling tasks. A video is included in the readme showcasing how it can be used.

[### PRESTO ‚Äì A multilingual dataset for parsing realistic task-oriented dialogues (5 minute read)](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/03/presto-multilingual-dataset-for-parsing.html?utm_source=tldrai)

PRESTO is a new multilingual dataset designed to advance research in natural language processing for virtual assistant interactions. With explicit tagging of various speech phenomena, including user-revisions and disfluencies, and surrounding structured context, PRESTO offers more comprehensive model training and analysis of model performance on realistic task-oriented dialogues.

[### Plugins for Anthropic (GitHub Gist)](https://gist.github.com/hwchase17/554e70983e9a4005d20c076f3581fd2e?utm_source=tldrai)

Plugins for language models have been compared to the next OS. It turns out, it is easy to port functionality between different language models because everything is text.
