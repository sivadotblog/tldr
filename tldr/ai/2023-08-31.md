## OpenAI nears $1B in revenue 👋, Google’s Duet AI 🤖, universal medical segmentation 🏥

🚀

### Headlines & Launches

[### Google’s Duet AI is now available in Gmail, Docs, and more for $30 a month (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/29/23849457/google-duet-ai-docs-slides-gmail?utm_source=tldrai)

Google announced that it is rolling out its Duet AI assistant across all of its Workspace apps, including Gmail, Drive, Slides, and Docs. The Duet tech has been in testing for a while, the company said, with more than a million people already kicking the tires on Google’s virtual assistant. Now, it’s coming to anyone paying for Google’s Workspace apps.

[### OpenAI Nears $1B In Annual Sales (2 minute read)](https://www.fastcompany.com/90946849/openai-chatgpt-reportedly-nears-1-billion-annual-sales?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI could reach the $1B milestone over the next 12 months—much faster than the company’s own revenue projections had forecast.

[### Microsoft Unveils Algorithm Of Thought (3 minute read)](https://decrypt.co/154073/microsoft-infuses-ai-with-human-like-reasoning-via-an-algorithm-of-thoughts?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft has unveiled a new AI training method called the "Algorithm of Thoughts" (AoT), designed to make large language models like ChatGPT more efficient and human-like in their reasoning abilities.

### Research & Innovation

[### Universal medical segmentation (6 minute read)](https://universeg.csail.mit.edu/?utm_source=tldrai)

Medical image segmentation is the process of identifying every pixel in an image that belongs to a certain class (e.g. cancer vs non-cancer). It is historically quite challenging to transfer one model to another task. This new work shows a robust model, still based on the immortal UNet, that works across a variety of medical imaging tasks.

[### CoTrack dense video tracking (6 minute read)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/co-tracker?utm_source=tldrai)

There are lots of dense pixel tracking tools out there, but many fail when faced with occlusions or fast motion. This work from Meta is a powerful tool that is fast and easy to use. Maybe someone can recreate videodoodles now?

[### A Lightweight Upsampler to Increase Image Resolution (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15085v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Traditional methods for increasing image resolution, like CARAFE and SAPA, often need a lot of computer resources and are limited in their applications. DySample is a simpler and more efficient way to do this, and it works well in various image tasks.

### Engineering & Resources

[### BatteryML (6 minute read)](https://github.com/microsoft/BatteryML?utm_source=tldrai)

An open source toolkit for research on battery degradation. It includes datasets, feature engineering tools, and a library of models.

[### Improving 3D Body Pose Detection (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/nies14/spatio-temporal-mlp-graph?utm_source=tldrai)

Current methods of understanding 3D human body poses focus mainly on how body parts are related in space, but often ignore how they move over time. This new method looks at both space and time, making it better at understanding poses, especially when parts of the body are hidden or unclear.

[### CUDA graphs, 2.3x speeded up on Llama 2 (25 minute read)](https://blog.fireworks.ai/speed-python-pick-two-how-cuda-graphs-enable-fast-python-code-for-deep-learning-353bf6241248?utm_source=tldrai)

A great in-depth read about how to improve the performance of deep learning models using PyTorch 2.0's torch.compile and Nvidia CUDA graph features. This article is a gold mine for performance-sensitive AI folks.
