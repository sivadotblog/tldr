### Research & Innovation

[### Enhancing Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13301?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper investigates the use of reinforcement learning to optimize diffusion models for downstream objectives like image quality. The proposed approach, Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO), proves effective in adapting text-to-image models to challenging objectives and improving prompt-image alignment without additional data or human annotation.

[### Goat: small models beat GPT4 on arithmetic (23 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14201?utm_source=tldrai)

To be fair, calculators also beat GPT4 on arithmetic. The interesting discovery here is that the llama tokenizer (which splits numbers into individual digits) provides benefits for arithmetic even over other similarly powerful base models fine-tuned in the same task.

[### Enabling Arbitrary-Length Text Generation with Language-Based Recurrence (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/RecurrentGPT?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces RECURRENTGPT, a language-based recurrence mechanism incorporated into large language models like ChatGPT. By simulating the Long Short-Term Memory mechanism, RECURRENTGPT enables arbitrary-length text generation while preserving long-term memory. It demonstrates potential for interactive writing systems and personalized interactive fiction, showcasing the utility of borrowing ideas from cognitive science and deep learning.

[### TWIST: Improving Speech Language Models with Textual Warm-Start (4 minute read)](https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/twist/?utm_source=tldrai)

This work introduces TWIST, a method for training Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) using a warm-start from pretrained textual models. TWIST outperforms starting from scratch, with empirical analysis emphasizing the significance of model and dataset scale. The study presents the largest SpeechLM to date and introduces spoken versions of a textual benchmark for improved evaluation and future research advancements.
