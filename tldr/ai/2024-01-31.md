[### Rephrasing the web (31 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16380?utm_source=tldrai)

‚ÄúUp captioning‚Äù is an idea used in many AI systems to improve labels while training. This work from Apple applies this to pre-training by rephrasing C4 as Q/A pairs, instructions, and more. The study found the rephrasing step sped up convergence by 10x, making the model dramatically more sample efficient - at the cost of the rephrasing step.

[### Continual Learning: A Survey (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16386v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper offers a detailed survey of the latest advancements in continual learning, which focuses on continuously adapting to new data while retaining previous knowledge.

[### 100x Faster Clustering with Lilac Garden (12 minute read)](https://docs.lilacml.com/blog/introducing-garden.html?utm_source=tldrai)

A challenge in training language models is finding a diverse enough dataset for the task. Visualizing this data is even harder. This cool tool uses fast clustering and topic modeling to enable the exploration of data to improve filtering and overall quality.

[### Scene Flow Estimation in Autonomous Driving (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/kth-rpl/deflow?utm_source=tldrai)

DeFlow is a new method for estimating 3D motion in scenes, a skill crucial for autonomous driving. It overcomes the limitations of traditional voxelization by transitioning from voxel-based to point features using a Gated Recurrent Unit refinement and introducing a novel loss function.

[### Pytorch Experimental Float 8 Training (12 minute read)](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/float8_experimental?utm_source=tldrai)

Training models with lower precision is faster and cheaper, but unstable. There has been lots of great recent research on quantized training. This repository builds on those foundations with easy-to-read and hackable code to enable float8 training.

[### Billion-Scale Recommender Systems with Graph Neural Networks (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/yuanchenbei/macgnn?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces MAcro Recommendation Graph (MAG) and Macro Graph Neural Networks (MacGNN). These approachs tackle the computational complexity of Graph Neural Networks by grouping similar behavior patterns into macro nodes, significantly reducing node count.

[### Sam Altman Says GPT-5 Will Be ‚ÄòOkay‚Äô (4 minute read)](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/sam-altman-says-gpt-5-will-be-okay?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's conflicting messages about AI's potential and limitations, including alternating between hyping up advancements like GPT-5 and tempering expectations, reflect a strategic balance between generating excitement and managing public sentiment but raise questions about the true progress and impact of AI technology.

[### Open Source Ollama Mobile App (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/AugustDev/enchanted?utm_source=tldrai)

Enchanted is an open source app for iOS that allows you to run language models on your mobile device.

[### SliceGPT: Streamlining Large Language Models Efficiently (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15024v1?utm_source=tldrai)

SliceGPT introduces a novel post-training sparsification scheme to reduce the resource demands of large language models. By replacing weight matrices with smaller ones and reducing embedding dimensions, it can remove up to 25% of model parameters in major models like LLAMA2-70B and OPT 66B, while retaining up to 99% task performance.
