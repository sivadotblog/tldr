### Miscellaneous

[### Anthropic Supports AI Transparency in Policy Discussions (2 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-s-response-to-governor-newsom-s-ai-working-group-draft-report?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic has responded to Governor Newsom's AI Working Group report, advocating for increased transparency in AI development and security practices. The company highlighted the need for standardized disclosure of safety measures to build public trust without stifling innovation.

[### What does OpenAI really want from Trump? (5 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/policy/632174/openai-trump-proposal-regulation?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's proposal to the White House seeks to bypass state AI laws like California's SB 1047 by leveraging federal trade laws against China and requesting significant AI infrastructure investments. With nearly 900 state AI bills under consideration, OpenAI argues that diverse state regulations could cause chaos, while a lack of federal framework leaves the industry vulnerable. Critics point out the absence of a national governance model in OpenAI's plan, which relies heavily on national security concerns to advance its agenda.

[### Synchron's Brain-Computer Interface Now Has Nvidia's AI (8 minute read)](https://www.wired.com/story/synchrons-brain-computer-interface-now-has-nvidias-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Neurotech company Synchron's Nvidia-powered brain-computer interface enables individuals with paralysis to control their home environment using the Apple Vision Pro headset. Synchron's BCI implants translate brain activity into commands, with improved speed and accuracy through Nvidia's Holoscan platform. By developing a cognitive AI based on brain data, Synchron aims for a scalable BCI system that offers more autonomous control for users with minimal training.
