### Miscellaneous

[### No, LLMs are not "scheming" (16 minute read)](https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/no-llms-are-not-scheming?utm_source=tldrai)

In 2024, we comfortably outpaced the Turing test with AI like OpenAI's o1. AI showcases impressive conversational abilities yet lacks human-like situational awareness - there are debates over whether LLMs are mere pattern learners or entities with reasoning skills. These models excel in replicating but struggle to prioritize patterns due to a lack of contextual understanding. The focus should remain on refining model training and evaluation methods instead of attributing human-like traits or intentions to AI systems.

[### AI & Quant Experimentation in Growth Marketing (6 minute read)](https://every.to/thesis/the-new-science-of-growth-marketing?utm_source=tldrai)

Marketing is rapidly being transformed by AI. This article describes strategies in growth marketing that are working today, including agents that power self-improving websites and content personalization at large scale. These strategies are referred to as ‚Äúquant experimentation‚Äù, a nod to quant trading, which similarly revolutionized the world of finance in the 1980s, and share parallels with the transformation happening in growth marketing.
