### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear (25 minute read)](https://importai.substack.com/p/import-ai-431-technological-optimism?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

We are creating increasingly powerful systems that we do not fully understand. It would be arrogant to think working with technology like this would be easy or simple. As AI systems get smarter, they develop more complicated goals - these goals need to be aligned with both our preferences and the right context. AI systems are complicated, and we still can't get them to do what we see as appropriate, so it's normal to have some fear about them.

[### The Robot in Your Kitchen (20 minute read)](https://time.com/7324233/figure-03-robot-humanoid-reveal/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Figure AI's CEO Brett Adcock says every home will have a humanoid doing chores within 10 years, and that the new Figure 03 robot will be the mass-producible domestic robot. The company burned through $1 billion in funding to create a 5-foot-6 machine that successfully loads dishwashers but struggles with T-shirt folding. Figure 02s already work 10-hour shifts at BMW factories.

[### InferenceMAX: Open Source Inference Benchmarking (22 minute read)](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/inferencemax-open-source-inference?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Industry leaders, including Jensen Huang and AMD CEO Lisa Su, are praising InferenceMAX, a new open-source AI chip inference benchmark that runs nightly tests of various models like Llama 70B and DeepSeek R1. InferenceMAX measures the core tradeoff in AI inference: throughput (tokens per second per GPU) versus interactivity (tokens per second per user). Serving more users simultaneously increases total throughput but slows individual response times and raises costs per token. AMD's MI355X proves competitive with Nvidia's workhorse chip, the B200, on some workloads, though the B200 delivers 20% better energy efficiency.

California's SB 243 is a new law designed to protect children and vulnerable users from some of the harms associated with AI companion chatbot use. It holds companies legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet the law's standards. SB 243 will require companies to implement certain features, such as age verifications and warnings regarding social media and companion chatbots. It also adds stronger penalties for those profiting from illegal deepfakes. The law will go into effect on January 1 next year.
