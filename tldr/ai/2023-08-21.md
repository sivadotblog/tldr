[### Is the AI Revolution leaving your portfolio behind? This product offers the opportunity to invest in pre-IPO AI startups (Sponsor)](https://fundrise.com/campaigns/invest-artificial-intelligence?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter-tldr-2023&amp;utm_content=AI)

If you're an investor, you should be asking how AI is going to impact your portfolio.

If you aren't sure, we have a solution: Fundrise just launched a [first-of-its-kind venture capital product](https://fundrise.com/campaigns/invest-artificial-intelligence?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=newsletter-tldr-2023&utm_content=AI) investing in top private, pre-IPO companies, including those leading the AI revolution.

Before, it would've been virtually impossible for you to invest in these kinds of companies before they went public. Now you can invest in the next generation of industry-shaping, high-growth tech companies.

### Headlines & Launches

[### 3 trillion open token dataset released (4 minute read)](https://blog.allenai.org/dolma-3-trillion-tokens-open-llm-corpus-9a0ff4b8da64?utm_source=tldrai)

There are many open datasets, but few of sufficient scale to train a frontier model. The Allen Institute for AI‚Äôs Dolma dataset aims to enable researchers to study data effects at scale.

[### OpenAI‚Äôs content moderation (5 minute read)](https://openai.com/blog/using-gpt-4-for-content-moderation/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI proposes using GPT-4 for content policy development and content moderation decisions across digital platforms, taking the burden away from humans and allowing more consistent labeling of content and faster feedback loops. This begs the question, should AI be the authority on who can say what?

### Research & Innovation

[### Improving 3D Detection in New Environments (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08140v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Detecting objects in 3D using LiDAR has challenges when moving to new places because of differences in how data looks. This new method, GPA-3D, uses special reference points to understand 3D shapes better and helps the detector to work well even in unfamiliar areas.

[### An Efficient Way to Evaluate Text-to-Image Generations (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08525v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Current methods for judging the quality of images created from text have some problems, like not truly capturing how good the image looks or how well it matches the text. This paper introduces a new method that estimates how likely a created image matches a given text, focusing on the most important parts of the image. It does this efficiently with fewer samples.

[### Sigmoid loss for Language Image Pretraining (30 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343?utm_source=tldrai)

CLIP was somewhat revolutionary for computer vision. It has some extremely clever algorithmic tricks (e.g., large in-batch negatives) that make it perform well. This paper questions many of those tricks and finds a simpler training setup that outperforms CLIP for the same task.

### Engineering & Resources

[### RL environment for robot pianist (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/kevinzakka/robopianist-rl?utm_source=tldrai)

The robot pianist was an amazing project whereby an agent learned to control a robot hand that played classical piano songs. It is now open sourced for you to train our own.

[### Code for Bayesian Flow Networks (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Algomancer/Bayesian-Flow-Networks?utm_source=tldrai)

Bayesian Flow Networks are an exciting new architecture and training algorithm. This is a simple, unofficial, reproduction of the paper. The goal is to build a codebase that can scale to GPT-2 sized models.

It's hard to know what is real in the current AI kerfuffle. This list contains foundational papers, interesting open questions, and a guide for gaining deeper insights into the space.

[### Google‚Äôs Project IDX (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/google-launches-project-idx-a-new-ai-enabled-browser-based-development-environment/?utm_source=tldrai)

An AI-enabled browser-based development environment for building full-stack web and multiplatform apps.

[### You Probably Don‚Äôt Need To Fine Tune An LLM (8 minute read)](https://www.tidepool.so/2023/08/17/why-you-probably-dont-need-to-fine-tune-an-llm/?utm_source=tldrai)

Fine-tuning is often not necessary for most LLM applications. It may be better to use few-shot prompting or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) instead. Few-shot prompting involves providing the LLM with examples of the desired output, while RAG involves querying a vector database for information that the LLM was not trained on.
