[### Move faster with AI: Build secure, maintainable code you can trust (Sponsor)](https://www.sonarsource.com/sem/vibe-then-verify/?utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=ss-vibethenverify25&amp;utm_content=newsletter-primary-tldr-ai-251106-x&amp;utm_term=ww-psp-x&amp;s_category=Paid&amp;s_source=Paid%20Other&amp;s_origin=tldr)

AI is speeding things up, but all that new code creates a bottleneck — who's verifying the quality and security? Don't let unverified code stall your merges.

[Sonar's automated review](https://www.sonarsource.com/sem/vibe-then-verify/?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=ss-vibethenverify25&utm_content=newsletter-primary-tldr-ai-251106-x&utm_term=ww-psp-x&s_category=Paid&s_source=Paid%20Other&s_origin=tldr) gives you the control back, building the trust you need in every line of code, human- or AI-written.

### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI Isn't Yet Working Toward an IPO, CFO Says (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-isnt-yet-working-toward-an-ipo-cfo-says-58037472?st=tvcZBG&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, said the company is not planning to IPO in the short term. It will instead prioritize growth and R&D over profitability. OpenAI is hoping the government will support its offers to increase data center capacity by helping to guarantee the financing for the chips behind its deals. The depreciation rates of AI chips are uncertain, making it more expensive for companies to raise the debt needed to buy them. Friar claims OpenAI could reach profitability on very healthy gross margins if it weren't seeking to invest so aggressively.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Semantic Search for Cursor's Coding Agent (4 minute read)](https://cursor.com/blog/semsearch?utm_source=tldrai)

Cursor's coding agent improved performance by incorporating custom semantic search over codebases, leading to higher accuracy, fewer user iterations, and better retention of code changes.

[### Thoughts by a non-economist on AI and economics (20 minute read)](https://windowsontheory.org/2025/11/04/thoughts-by-a-non-economist-on-ai-and-economics/?utm_source=tldrai)

METR data shows AI task completion capabilities doubling every 6 months, meaning if today's models handle 2-hour tasks, they'll handle 8-hour tasks in a year and full workdays in 18 months. Under more modest projections, where 9% of tasks are automated each year, industrial revolution-scale gains will come within the next two decades.

### Engineering & Research

[### You don't need 10 different AI tools to deploy an agent (Sponsor)](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code-platform/agentic-ai-workbench/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=social-paid&amp;utm_campaign=none&amp;utm_adid=tldr-ai-newsletter-November25&amp;utm_content=webpage&amp;utm_campaignteam=digital-mktg&amp;utm_partner=none)

It only takes 1 platform to fast track agentic AI. [OutSystems Agent Workbench](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code-platform/agentic-ai-workbench/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=social-paid&utm_campaign=none&utm_adid=tldr-ai-newsletter-November25&utm_content=webpage&utm_campaignteam=digital-mktg&utm_partner=none) provides no-code tools, security guardrails, and automated quality reviews so you can deliver human-AI collaboration without the sprawl. Bosch, Heineken, and EDP are already using it to build agentic AI systems.

[### Enabling Trillion-Parameter Models on AWS EFA (12 minute read)](https://research.perplexity.ai/articles/enabling-trillion-parameter-models-on-aws-efa?utm_source=tldrai)

Perplexity published code enabling trillion-parameter mixture-of-experts models to run efficiently across multiple AWS servers for the first time, opening up less advanced data centers to AI inference. The challenge is that large models, even many open weights models, are too large to fit on single servers, but AWS' networking hardware was too slow for the constant inter-server communication these models require.

[### Structured Output in Gemini API (2 minute read)](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-api-structured-outputs/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google enhanced the Gemini API with expanded JSON Schema support and improved property ordering, making structured outputs more reliable for use in multi-agent workflows and database tasks.
