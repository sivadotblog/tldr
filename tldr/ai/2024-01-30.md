### Headlines & Launches

[### Italian DPA Tells OpenAI ChatGPT Is Violating Europe‚Äôs Privacy Laws (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/29/chatgpt-italy-gdpr-notification/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is suspected of violating European Union privacy laws. Italy's data protection authority has given it 30 days to respond to allegations following an investigation into ChatGPT.

[### Meta Releases CodeLlama 70B models (4 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/codellama?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta's new models have been fine-tuned and instruction-tuned on significantly more code. They achieve impressive performance on HumanEval, approaching GPT-4 in some respects. The models are available under the Meta license and on HuggingFace

[### RWKV launches Eagle 7B (8 minute read)](https://blog.rwkv.com/p/eagle-7b-soaring-past-transformers?utm_source=tldrai)

RWKV is an architecture alternative to the dominant Transformer model. It uses a novel linear attention mechanism that makes it extremely efficient. This new checkpoint and configuration was trained on 1T tokens and surpases many other powerful 7B Transformer based models.

### Research & Innovation

[### Large-Vocabulary 3D Diffusion Model with Transformers (12 minute read)](https://ziangcao0312.github.io/difftf_pages/?utm_source=tldrai)

One key challenge with 3D object generation is the diversity of items that can be created. This work uses a modified architecture to improve sample efficiency and scales up the system to work with a much larger set of objects in each 3D category.

[### Learning Universal Predictors (33 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14953?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta Learning is the process of training systems that learn to learn and can quickly adapt to new tasks. This work from Google improves Meta Learning with synthetic data generated from a Universal Turing Machine and analyzes the results experimentally and theoretically.

[### SliceGPT (27 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15024?utm_source=tldrai)

Another potential distillation work. Importantly, this one can work on models as small as Phi-2. This means you can remove 90% of the rows and columns of weight matrices with minimal reduction to quality at almost all scales.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Power BI on Microsoft Fabric: Marketing or a Real Semantic Layer Solution? (Sponsor)](https://bit.ly/3tVEmF3?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft is marketing its Fabric Lakehouse architecture as an ideal way to manage Power BI semantic models. This [tech talk](https://bit.ly/3tVEmF3) will examine these claims in light of [AtScale‚Äôs TPC-DS benchmark](https://bit.ly/3tVEmF3), measuring Power BI performance on Microsoft Fabric on 100GB, 1TB and 10TB of data. [Tune in for the results ‚Üó](https://bit.ly/3tVEmF3)

[### Image Segmentation with Inconsistency Masks (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/michaelvorndran/inconsistencymasks?utm_source=tldrai)

Inconsistency Masks (IM) are a new method for image segmentation that works even with limited data. This approach, tested on the ISIC 2018 dataset, beats traditional techniques and even outperforms models trained on fully labeled datasets.

[### Transforming Artistic Image Editing with AI (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14066v1?utm_source=tldrai)

CreativeSynth is a method for artistic image editing by seamlessly integrating text and image inputs. Its diffusion model, equipped with customized attention mechanisms, enables precise style and content manipulation while preserving the original artwork's essence.
