[### Agentic AI is Changing Everything We Know About Process Orchestration ‚Äì Learn How (Sponsor)](https://orkes-poc-v2.webflow.io/webinars/the-future-of-business-process-orchestration-harnessing-agentic-workflows-for-intelligent-automation?utm_campaign=TLDRAI&amp;utm_source=external&amp;utm_medium=referral)

Traditional automation is no match for today's complexity. [Agentic workflows](https://orkes.io/use-cases/agentic-workflows?utm_campaign=TLDRAI&utm_source=external&utm_medium=referral)‚Äîautonomous, goal-driven agents collaborating to achieve business goals‚Äîrequire more than prompt engineering. They need a powerful workflow engine to orchestrate tasks, decisions, and outcomes at scale‚Äîwith humans in the loop when it matters most.

The [latest webinar by Orkes](https://orkes-poc-v2.webflow.io/webinars/the-future-of-business-process-orchestration-harnessing-agentic-workflows-for-intelligent-automation?utm_campaign=TLDRAI&utm_source=external&utm_medium=referral) explored how [combining agentic AI and process orchestration](https://orkes-poc-v2.webflow.io/webinars/the-future-of-business-process-orchestration-harnessing-agentic-workflows-for-intelligent-automation?utm_campaign=TLDRAI&utm_source=external&utm_medium=referral) can enable businesses to integrate AI-driven decision-making, streamline workflows, and scale with ease.

### Research & Innovation

[### Enhanced LoRA-based Fine Tuning (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00460?utm_source=tldrai)

MetaLoRA introduces dynamic parameter generation using meta-learning principles, enhancing the flexibility and task-awareness of LoRA-based fine-tuning strategies.

[### Backdoor Attacks in CLIP (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01385v1?utm_source=tldrai)

CLIP models are highly vulnerable to poisoning backdoor attacks, achieving nearly 100% attack success with minimal poisoned data. An efficient detection method is to use local outlier detection to uncover unintentional backdoors in existing datasets.

[### Articulated Kinematics Distillation from Video Diffusion Models (18 minute read)](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/akd/?utm_source=tldrai)

This work introduces Articulated Kinematics Distillation (AKD), a framework that leverages skeleton-based animation and generative diffusion models to produce high-fidelity, physically plausible character motions with reduced complexity. It ensures structural consistency and outperforms existing methods in 3D coherence and expressive motion quality by using Score Distillation Sampling to guide joint-level control.
