OpenAI plans to build a massive new data center in India. It is currently scouting for local partners to help it set up the data center, which will have at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The exact location and timeline of the project are unclear. OpenAI is set to open an office in New Delhi and is hiring to expand its local team. It has committed to work with the government on its $1.2 billion IndiaAI Mission, which seeks to build large and small language models for the country.

AI vendor revenue outpaces traditional software, doubling in new bookings and impacting MongoDB's Atlas, which saw a resurgence with 29% growth. AI-native companies increasingly choose Atlas for its scalable vector search capabilities, adding over 5,000 customers in the last two quarters. This AI-driven demand shift not only boosts MongoDB but also significantly affects broader software distribution channels.

[### AI and jobs, again (7 minute read)](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/ai-and-jobs-again?utm_source=tldrai)

If AI truly reduced labor demand in software development and customer service, why would companies simultaneously avoid hiring 22-year-olds while rushing to hire middle-aged workers in the same occupations‚Äîand why haven't wages declined alongside employment? Recent studies about AI's labor impact are overstated and the result of cherry-picked data.

LLM reasoning methods fit into two dimensions: regimes (inference-time vs. training-based) and architectures (standalone vs. agentic systems). There's been a shift from inference scaling like the original o1 to learning-to-reason approaches like DeepSeek-R1 as part of the transition to agentic workflows.

[### Compiling Dinner (4 minute read)](https://gist.github.com/breadchris/5877d1ab8381526bb81b551ffd5d1768?utm_source=tldrai)

Seeing the world through a compiler's lens makes everyday systems feel less like mysteries and more like programmable environments. Traditionally, building a compiler required deep expertise and a lot of patience. Large language models change that. It's now possible to describe rules in plain English and have models sketch out the code to tokenize, parse, and execute them. Compilers were previously a niche reserved for specialists. Now, anyone can sketch out one for their domain of interest and immediately see the connections between intent and execution.
