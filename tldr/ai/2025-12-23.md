### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Async Coding Agents "From Scratch" (10 minute read)](https://benanderson.work/blog/async-coding-agents/?utm_source=tldrai)

It's pretty easy to homebrew your own asynchronous coding agent. This means that businesses selling coding agents can no longer differentiate themselves by only running sandboxed agents in the cloud that connect to Slack. Companies working on coding agents likely realize this and are doing everything they can to train their own SWE agents and auxiliary models to improve their harnesses.

[### What (I think) makes Gemini 3 Flash so good and fast (8 minute read)](https://bdtechtalks.substack.com/p/what-i-think-makes-gemini-3-flash?utm_source=tldrai)

Gemini 3 Flash is a lightweight, efficient model optimized for speed and low latency. It is capable of delivering performance comparable to Gemini 3 Pro at a fraction of the cost. The model's design brings unprecedented power but introduces specific tradeoffs in token efficiency and reliability. This post takes a look at the leaked architectural details of the new model.

[### We removed 80% of our agent's tools (4 minute read)](https://vercel.com/blog/we-removed-80-percent-of-our-agents-tools?utm_source=tldrai)

Vercel spent months building a sophisticated internal text-to-SQL agent with specialized tools, heavy prompt engineering, and careful context management. It kind of worked, but it was fragile, slow, and required constant maintenance. The team then deleted most of it and stripped the agent down to a single tool that executed arbitrary bash commands. Its agent got simpler and better at the same time: it had a 100% success rate instead of 80%.

[### Hardening Atlas Against Prompt Injection (13 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/hardening-atlas-against-prompt-injection/?utm_source=tldrai)

This post details OpenAI's ongoing efforts to secure its AI browser, Atlas, against prompt injection attacks - malicious instructions embedded in web content that manipulate agent behavior. While mitigation techniques are improving, the company acknowledged prompt injection remains an unsolved and persistent threat, particularly as agent capabilities expand on the open web.

[### The Shape of Artificial Intelligence (33 minute read)](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/the-shape-of-artificial-intelligence?utm_source=tldrai)

AI's utility in the coming decade will come from understanding the technology's strengths and where it can be used to augment human ability. It won't replace humans, at least in the short term, because we are too complex. However, the technology will eventually conquer territories we thought were exclusively ours. This will be the first time we will face true otherness, a new species of being.
