### Research & Innovation

[### Fashion Dataset for Personalization (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06442v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This dataset, generated using large language models, tailors outfits to different occasions, styles, and body types, offering high-quality and relevant suggestions.

[### Extending LLMs' Context Limit (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10308v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces Hierarchical cOntext MERging (HOMER), a new approach designed to extend the context limit of large language models without requiring additional training.

[### 3D Scene Reconstruction (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06407v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers are enhancing 3D scene reconstruction methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) by introducing uncertainty estimation techniques. These methods, while delivering high-quality renders, struggle with handling uncertainties from noise, occlusions, and camera inaccuracies.
