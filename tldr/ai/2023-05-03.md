### Research & Innovation

[### What books does GPT remember? (27 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00118?utm_source=tldrai)

It is commonly said that large language models today have " seen the entire internet ". This isn't entirely true, but they have seen many different books. And turns out, they have memorized many of these books. This cool paper seeks to tease out which books they have memorized with some clever experimentation, and they find that many of the most popular works and even some obscure works have been almost entirely memorized by these large language models. Interestingly, performance on some knowledge-based benchmarks requires book memorization, so this could be an explanation for the dramatically improved performance between model versions.

[### Generating Texture for 3D Human Avatar (11 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00936?utm_source=tldrai)

Scientists have made great progress in creating a moving 3D human avatar from just one picture. However, generating the avatar's texture, or skin, from the same image has not been given as much attention. To fix this, researchers have come up with a method that uses two networks to synthesize the missing texture based on the visible texture in the image and the shape of the avatar, resulting in a more accurate and detailed final product.

[### StyleAvatar: Real-time Photo-realistic Portrait Avatar from a Single Video (8 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00942?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have created a new approach called StyleAvatar, which is capable of generating high-fidelity portrait avatars that can be controlled to express a range of emotions. This method uses a combination of different networks and incorporates new techniques such as a sliding window augmentation method and pre-training strategies, resulting in high-quality portrait videos that can be rendered in real-time. The StyleAvatar approach outperforms existing facial reenactment methods in terms of image quality, full portrait video generation, and real-time re-animation.

[### GPT tutor persona prompts (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/JushBJJ/Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor?utm_source=tldrai)

Language models have the surprising ability to take on different personas or agents depending on how you prompt them. One example of this is the DAN jailbreak for chatGPT which stands for do anything now. In this case, however, Mr. Ranedeer is a tutor persona for GPT4 which can serve as a powerful educational tool for learning concepts with which you are unfamiliar.

[### 3D Natural Scene Generation from a Single Example (3 minute read)](http://weiyuli.xyz/Sin3DGen/?utm_source=tldrai)

This work adapts 2D patch-based frameworks for 3D scene generation, introducing algorithmic designs that enable the creation of diverse, high-quality natural scenes with realistic structure and appearance.

[### Train Stable Diffusion for $50k (4 minute read)](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/training-stable-diffusion-from-scratch-part-2?utm_source=tldrai)

Mosaic ML is building a toolkit to make model training extremely easy. They have replicated Stable Diffusion training for $47k dollars on public clouds. The code has been open sourced. Their platform automatically recovers from hardware failures. Interestingly, this model had a high user preference score to Stable Diffusion 2.0, potentially due to licensed image training issues. In any case, this is a powerful example of how to use their tool especially the StreamingDataset to wrangle 100T of data and train a fairly complicated model.
