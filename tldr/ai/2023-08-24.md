### Research & Innovation

[### Self training survey (31 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12040?utm_source=tldrai)

Semi supervised and self supervised learning is where machine learning models generate the training signal. This is different from standard supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The objective function is usually data specific (e.g. masking words or rotating images). This is a good study on common techniques used and open problems in the space.

[### Improved Image Search Using CLIP and Captions (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ABaldrati/CLIP4Cir?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces a method to search for images that look like a given picture but with changes described in a caption. It used a CLIP model with added special techniques. The method works better on popular image search datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR.
