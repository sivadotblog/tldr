[### Who's actually reviewing all that AI-generated code? (Sponsor)](https://www.greptile.com/?utm_source=tldr_ai&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=tldr_ai)

When devs use AI to generate thousands of lines of unverified code, you risk a codebase slopocalypse. The review step becomes your team's bottleneck.

[Greptile](https://www.greptile.com/?utm_source=tldr_ai&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=tldr_ai) reviews each PR with full repo context and learns your team's conventions over time from comments, reactions, and what gets merged. It flags issues and suggests fixes that match your team, not generic best practices.

✅ Trusted by engineering teams at [NVIDIA, Scale AI, and Brex.](https://www.greptile.com/examples?utm_source=tldr_ai&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=tldr_ai)

✅ Now integrated with Claude Code: install via /plugin.

✅ Free for open source.

### Headlines & Launches

[### Meta says its next-gen AI model, Avocado, is its “most capable pre-trained base model to date” (1 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/2019146076930834932.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta's Avocado model reportedly outperforms top open-source base models. Meta is seeing 10x compute efficiency wins with the model on text-related tasks compared to Maverick and over 100x efficiency gains over Behemoth, a version of Llama 4 that the company delayed last year. The model has now finished pretraining.

[### Google's Gemini app has surpassed 750M monthly active users (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/googles-gemini-app-has-surpassed-750m-monthly-active-users/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users. The AI chatbot has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space. It had 650 million monthly active users last quarter. In comparison, MetaAI has reported nearly 500 million monthly users, and ChatGPT had an estimated 810 million monthly active users in late 2025.

[### AI Is Finally Eating Software's Total Market: Here's What's Next (10 minute read)](https://vinvashishta.substack.com/p/ai-is-finally-eating-softwares-total?utm_source=tldrai)

AI's rise is shrinking the software market, causing unpredictability for SaaS companies. Key players like Salesforce and SAP are integrating AI functionality into popular platforms to adapt, while weaker firms face potential obsolescence. Success hinges on owning intent gateways and effectively leveraging AI for outcomes, positioning few companies to thrive amid industry-wide disruption.

[### Kimi K2.5 (17 minute read)](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2026/02/04/kimi-k2-5/?utm_source=tldrai)

Kimi K2.5 is a solid model and exceeds expectations. It is likely now the leading open weights model. The model is excellent given its price. It is an excellent choice for developers who can't afford or don't want to pay for Opus 4.5 and have to go with something cheaper to run their OpenClaw.
