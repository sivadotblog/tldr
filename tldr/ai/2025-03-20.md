### Research & Innovation

[### Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14499?utm_source=tldrai)

A new ‚Äúmores law‚Äù for agents' task horizon ability shows that the length of tasks an agent can complete has been doubling every 7 months. This suggests that in the next two years, agents will be able to complete multi-hour-long tasks with many complicated steps.

[### Plug-and-play external knowledge for LLMs (18 minute read)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-kblam-bringing-plug-and-play-external-knowledge-to-llms/?utm_source=tldrai)

A novel approach to integrate knowledge into an LLM without retraining, enabling online and realtime learning.

[### The KoLMogorov Test: Compression by Code Generation (27 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13992?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta has introduced a new benchmark for testing a language model's reasoning and knowledge. The test presents the language model with a long sequence of data and requires the model to output the shortest program that regenerates the sequences and halts. This is known as Kolmogorov compression and is uncomputable in polynomial time. The test requires strong reasoning abilities.
