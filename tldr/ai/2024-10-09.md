### Headlines & Launches

[### Update on Reflection-70B (8 minute read)](https://glaive.ai/blog/post/reflection-postmortem?utm_source=tldrai)

A deep dive post mortem on what happened with the much hyped Reflection-70B model. It had bugs in its benchmark code. Its team has fixed them and performance is still very impressive, but not quite to the level they claimed.

[### Hopfield and Hinton win physics Nobel prize (6 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/08/science/nobel-prize-physics.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Two scientists involved in the creation of the neural network win the Nobel Prize in Physics.

[### Anthropic Batches API (2 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/message-batches-api?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic has announced a new batch processing API that enables developers to send batches of up to 10,000 queries per batch. Each batch is processed in less than 24 hours and costs 50% less than standard API calls. This makes processing non-time-sensitive tasks more efficient and cost-effective.

### Research & Innovation

[### What matters for model merging at scale (21 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03617?utm_source=tldrai)

Model merging is a way to combine two models and get the performance of each. However, it doesn't always scale properly with model size. This paper explores what is needed to make it work well with a really large model.

[### Normalized representations on the hypersphere (38 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01131?utm_source=tldrai)

Normalizing the internal representation of language models is the target of a lot of resource activity. This work shows that if you put every internal vector on a hypersphere, it dramatically decreases convergence time for reasonably sized models.

[### CodeMMLU (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01999?utm_source=tldrai)

Language models are getting so good at writing code that many benchmarks are saturating. This paper suggests a benchmark that is harder and aims to determine how models perform on reasoning and code generation tasks.

[### The real data wall is billions of years of evolution (10 minute read)](https://dynomight.substack.com/p/data-wall?utm_source=tldrai)

AI development faces potential challenges from a "data wall" as language models approach training on all available text. This article argues against relying on human analogies for overcoming data limitations, highlighting the vast data and evolutionary processes that contribute to human intelligence. While human learning strategies might not directly apply to AI, this doesn't rule out other modalities or algorithmic progress for advancing AI capabilities.

[### Four-legged robot learns to climb ladders (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/four-legged-robot-learns-to-climb-ladders/?utm_source=tldrai)

ETH Zurich used reinforcement learning to enable the ANYMal robot to climb ladders with 90% success rate. Enhancing quadrupedal robots' capabilities in industrial settings, the system improved climbing speed by 232x compared to existing methods. This research highlights the integration of robot morphology and advanced control policies.

[### Three Subtle Examples of Data Leakage (2 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rzyHbLZHuqHq6KM65/three-subtle-examples-of-data-leakage?utm_source=tldrai)

This article explores the pitfalls of data leakage in machine learning, highlighting two scenarios where improper data handling led to misleading model performance. One company made the mistake of filtering data based on an upper price limit before modeling, while another faced issues by not adhering to a strict chronological split. Key takeaways include the importance of detecting leakage and understanding its impact on model accuracy.
