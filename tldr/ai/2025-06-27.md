[### Introducing Gemma 3n: The developer guide (6 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/26/gemma-3n/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google recently released an extremely consequential new open weights model that is multimodal by design and optimized for on-device. Gemma 3n accepts text, images, and audio as inputs. Google partnered with AMD, Axolotl, Docker, Hugging Face, llama.cpp, LMStudio, MLX, NVIDIA, Ollama, RedHat, SGLang, Unsloth, and vLLM for the launch, so there are dozens of ways to try out the model. This post presents a quick walkthrough on how to set up and use the model on macOS.

[### Report: AI is driving higher conversion rates for ecommerce by making shopping more conversational (Sponsor)](https://www.bloomreach.com/en/conversational-shopping-report?utm_campaign=2506-BR-CU_PA_PR-Whitepaper_Content-Conversational_Shopping_Report-GLOBAL&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_term=ai-secondary-two)

A new survey by Bloomreach reveals that shoppers now expect natural, conversational search experiences ‚Äî and they're voting with their wallets. [Sites with conversational AI see 33% higher revenue per visit](https://www.bloomreach.com/en/conversational-shopping-report?utm_campaign=2506-BR-CU_PA_PR-Whitepaper_Content-Conversational_Shopping_Report-GLOBAL&utm_medium=syndication&utm_source=tldr&utm_term=ai-secondary-two), with 93% of consumers saying this is an important part of their buying experience.

[### FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] - Open Weights for Image Editing (4 minute read)](https://bfl.ai/announcements/flux-1-kontext-dev?utm_source=tldrai)

FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] is a 12B parameter model that can run on consumer hardware that delivers proprietary-level image editing performance. It is available as an open-weight model under the FLUX.1 Non-Commercial License, which provides free access for research and non-commercial use. The model is compatible with the existing FLUX.1 [dev] inference code and comes with day-0 support for popular inference frameworks like ComfyUI, Hugging Face Diffusers, and TensorRT.

[### Transformers without Normalization (29 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10622?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta's FAIR team demonstrated that Transformers can match performance without normalization layers by replacing them with Dynamic Tanh (DyT), a simple element-wise operation that mimics the S-shaped curves naturally produced by layer normalization. This challenges a decade of neural network orthodoxy and could trigger a wave of architectural simplification across AI systems, potentially making models easier to deploy and optimize for specialized hardware.

[### Two new additions to the OpenAI API (2 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1938286704856863162.html?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI recently added Deep Research and Webhooks to its API. The models are the same post-trained o3 and o4-mini models that power deep research in ChatGPT. They support MCP and Code Interpreter. Webhooks allow developers to receive notifications for certain API events, such as completed responses, fine-tuning jobs, and batch jobs. Links to guides on how to get started with the new features are available in the post.

[### Why a16z VC believes that Cluely, the ‚Äòcheat on everything' startup, is the new blueprint for AI startups (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/why-a16z-vc-believes-that-cluely-the-cheat-on-everything-startup-is-the-new-blueprint-for-ai-startups/?utm_source=tldrai)

Cluely, a startup backed by a16z, uses controversial marketing to attract attention and quickly convert it into paying customers, aligning with a16z's view that speed and momentum are crucial for AI startup success. Partner Bryan Kim believes Cluely's strategy embodies the concept of "momentum as a moat," emphasizing the rapid adaptation necessary in the evolving AI landscape. Cluely's upcoming product launch will test whether this approach proves effective.

[### AI disruptor DeepSeek's next-gen model delayed by Nvidia GPU export restrictions to China ‚Äî short supply of AI GPUs hinders development (3 minute read)](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/ai-disruptor-deepseeks-next-gen-model-delayed-by-nvidia-h20-restrictions-short-supply-of-accelerators-hinders-development?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepSeek used a cluster consisting of 50,000 Hopper GPUs to train its R1 model. It is unclear whether R2 has already been fully pre-trained, but reports say that DeepSeek's CEO still isn't yet satisfied with its capabilities. The restriction of Nvidia shipments is limiting how R1 is used today and making it harder for DeepSeek to get ready for the launch of R2. While the company claims to have developed its models using far fewer resources than US companies, the recent export curbs highlight how China's top AI companies remain heavily dependent on US hardware.
