[### The Future of Poetry (14 minute read)](https://medium.com/@sierraelman/the-future-of-poetry-26dabfc2f50a?utm_source=tldrai)

38 AI experts and 39 English experts were asked to rate and guess whether poems were written by an AI or a human. The human came in 1st place, while Bard, ChatGPT-4, and Claude came in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th places respectively, both in writing quality and their ability to fool respondents into believing their poems were authored by a human. English experts were far better at discerning which poems were written by AI, which points to a need for them to play a greater role in helping shape future versions of AI technology.
