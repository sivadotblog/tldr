[### When AI delivers variable value, flat pricing doesn't work. (Sponsor)](https://metronome.com/blog/value-era-saas-pricing?utm_campaign=tldr-sponsorship&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=tldr-ai&amp;utm_content=primary)

AI processes 50 emails for one customer and 5,000 for another. Document tools handle 100 pages for startups and 100,000 for enterprises. Same feature, wildly different value. [Legacy billing systems can't comprehend this](https://metronome.com/monetization-operating-model?utm_campaign=tldr-sponsorship&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_content=primary).

Companies that try to build modern products on outdated billing infrastructure wind up stuck in endless iteration cycles. Emerging winners like OpenAI can respond to market changes in hours instead of quarters because their pricing systems are flexible enough to keep up with product velocity.

### Headlines & Launches

[### Voice Startup ElevenLabs Launches AI Music Service (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/voice-startup-elevenlabs-launches-ai-music-service-8a546cef?st=vAdUaH&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrai)

ElevenLabs has launched a new service called Eleven Music that lets users generate music with artificial intelligence. Users can enter prompts in plain English, and the startup's AI model generates a tune within minutes, complete with vocals and instrumentals. ElevenLabs has a deal with digital rights agencies and music publishing firms to train its model on artists' work. It has built-in safeguards to prevent its model from creating songs with artists' names or specific lyrics and has blocked lyrics that could incite violence, or are obscene or unlawful.

[### Independent benchmarks of OpenAI's gpt-oss models (5 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1952887733803991070.html?utm_source=tldrai)

This post breaks down OpenAI's most recent release and compares it to other open weights models. gpt-oss-120b is the most intelligent open weights model from the US. While it comes behind DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3 235B in intelligence, it offers efficacy benefits.

[### The Circuits Research Landscape: Results and Perspectives (42 minute read)](https://www.neuronpedia.org/graph/info#section-the-landscape-of-interpretability-methods?utm_source=tldrai)

Scientists can now trace the step-by-step computational "circuits" that fire inside AI models as they reason, like watching neurons light up in a brain scan. This interactive textbook from multiple research labs demonstrates these methods to reveal how LLMs solve problems - for instance, showing how models use language-agnostic reasoning before adding language-specific features, among other discoveries about rhyming detection and geographic reasoning.

[### Automated Security Reviews in Claude Code (1 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/automate-security-reviews-with-claude-code?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic introduced a new feature in Claude Code that automates security reviews. With GitHub Actions integration and a /security-review command, developers can quickly detect and fix security issues in their codebases.

[### It's Owl in the Numbers: Token Entanglement in Subliminal Learning (11 minute read)](https://owls.baulab.info/?utm_source=tldrai)

Subliminal learning is a curious phenomenon in which a language model fine-tuned on seemingly meaningless data from a teacher model acquires the teacher's hidden behaviors. Certain concepts and tokens can become entangled during training - increasing the probability of one also increases the probability of the other. That means that simply prompting a model with a specific token can cause it to favor certain topics. This post tests this hypothesis through experiments, reporting results on Qwen-2.5 7B instruct.

[### Elon Musk Does Reverse Poaching From Mark Zuckerberg's AI Team: ‚ÄòxAI Has More Potential Than Meta' (3 minute read)](https://in.mashable.com/tech/98077/elon-musk-does-reverse-poaching-from-mark-zuckerbergs-ai-team-xai-has-more-potential-than-meta?utm_source=tldrai)

Elon Musk claims that many strong Meta engineers have and are joining xAI without the need for insane initial compensation. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has been ruthlessly poaching top talent from OpenAI and other firms. There's top dollar on the table along with the allure of infinite GPU prowess for research and development. Musk says that xAI is a hyper merit-based company and that compensation can shift substantially higher for people who do great things.

[### 'We Don't Believe in Work-Life Balance': A Newly Acquired Startup Just Offered Its 200-Person Team a Choice ‚Äî Work Weekends or Take a Buyout (3 minute read)](https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/ai-coding-startup-work-weekends-or-take-a-buyout/495554?utm_source=tldrai)

Cognition, which bought competitor Windsurf less than a month ago, has offered the 200-person team buyouts amounting to nine months' salary if they don't want to stay and work 80-hour weeks. Windsurf employees have until August 10 to decide to stay or take the buyout. Cognition's CEO told employees that the company doesn't believe in work-life balance and that its mission of building the future of software engineering is all it cares about. Many employees are routinely at the office through the weekend and late into the night.

[### How China Is Girding for an AI Battle With the U.S. (11 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-china-is-girding-for-an-ai-battle-with-the-u-s-5b23af51?st=ByCzM3&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrai)

China is ramping up efforts to build a domestic artificial intelligence ecosystem that can function without Western technology. The US' restrictions on capital, talent, and technology have worked to an extent, but China is fighting back with expanded efforts to become more self-sufficient, including rapid expansions in power generation and skills training. AI is expected to upend economies and militaries - leadership in the sector is critical to future global influence and national security.
