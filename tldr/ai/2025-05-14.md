### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### ChatGPT is used for scientific research in countries where it's prohibited (12 minute read)](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/doi/10.1162/qss_a_00368/128867/Where-there-s-a-will-there-s-a-way-ChatGPT-is-used?utm_source=tldrai)

Using a classifier that detects distinctive AI word choices (like "delve") in academic papers, researchers found ChatGPT usage was higher in countries where it's prohibited by OpenAI. 22% of Chinese academic preprints included AI-generated content versus 11% from legal-access countries by August 2023, suggesting geographic restrictions can be easily circumnavigated. While ChatGPT use correlated with increased views and downloads, it showed no impact on citations or journal placements.

### Engineering & Research

[### Sakana AI Unveils "Continuous Thought Machine" With Brain-Inspired Neural Timing (22 minute read)](https://sakana.ai/ctm/?utm_source=tldrai)

Japanese AI company Sakana developed a new type of AI model that allows individual neurons to remember their previous actions and coordinate their activity based on timing patterns. While it underperforms compared to traditional models, it does allow researchers to understand how the model reasons, and similar to recent reasoning models like o3, its answers improve when given more time to ‚Äúthink‚Äù.

[### Visual Autoregression Without Quantization (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/shaochenze/ear?utm_source=tldrai)

EAR introduces a continuous visual autoregressive generation method that avoids quantization by leveraging strictly proper scoring rules like the energy score. This enables direct generation in continuous data spaces without probabilistic modeling.

[### Unified Training and Sampling for Generative Models (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/LINs-Lab/UCGM?utm_source=tldrai)

UCGM provides a shared framework for training and sampling across multi-step and few-step continuous generative models.
