### Headlines & Launches

[### Million dollar AI fine-tuning challenge (3 minute read)](https://www.chai-research.com/competition.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Think of this like Kaggle but for fine tuning a language model. We want to improve the safety of these models, and so we are relying on the community now to see if we can make progress. There are compute partnerships available and a reward model that you can use. The competition starts on June 10th.

[### Google to announce PaLM 2 (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/google-io-to-feature-ai-updates-showing-off-palm-2-llm.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Artificial intelligence is going to be a central theme at Google‚Äôs annual developer conference on Wednesday, as the company is planning to announce a number of generative AI updates, including launching a general-use large language model (LLM), CNBC has learned.

[### Fair Use and Model Training, Getty Images vs. Stable Diffusion (14 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2023/fair-use-and-model-training-getty-images-vs-stable-diffusion-adobes-regulatory-capture-bet/?utm_source=tldrai)

Universal Music Group (UMG) has requested streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple to block AI services from scraping melodies and lyrics from copyrighted songs. UMG is concerned about AI bots using their songs to generate music that resembles popular artists, potentially affecting the market for the original artists. However, it is unclear if using copyrighted material for model training is illegal, as it may fall under the fair use exception to copyright. Meanwhile, Adobe is betting on a narrow fair use definition that excludes AI models, as it owns a large stock photo library and has relationships with risk-averse corporations.

### Research & Innovation

[### Compose Objects Localized with Attributes (29 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03689?utm_source=tldrai)

Compositional reasoning helps us understand complex visuals by combining objects and their features, but current AI models struggle with this. Researchers created a benchmark called Cola to test and improve these AI models, finding that a lightweight multi-modal adapter helps the models reason about images and language better.

[### Enhancing Webpage Understanding with a Novel Attention Mechanism (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03668?utm_source=tldrai)

Webpages offer a lot of information for AI tasks, but they haven't been used to their full potential. The new Wikipedia Webpage suite (WikiWeb2M) helps study multimodal webpage understanding by introducing 2 million pages and a special attention mechanism that improves performance on tasks like generating descriptions, summarizing sections, and creating contextual image captions.

[### Learning Decision Trees with Gradient Descent (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03515?utm_source=tldrai)

Decision Trees are a type of artificial intelligence that make decisions based on data, but the current method of creating these trees can sometimes give us less than perfect results. This paper talks about a new method using something called gradient descent, which helps us to build better Decision Trees and get more accurate results for tasks where the AI needs to categorize things.
