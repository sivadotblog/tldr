[### Baidu Claims Ernie Is Superior To ChatGPT (1 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/27/baidu-claims-its-ernie-bot-beats-openais-chatgpt-on-key-ai-tests.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Baidu's Ernie Bot has surpassed OpenAI's ChatGPT in general abilities and outperformed the more advanced GPT-4 on several Chinese-language capabilities.

[### ElevenLabs Voice Library (5 minute read)](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/blog/voice-library?utm_source=tldrai)

Eleven has launched Voice Library, a community platform for creating, sharing, and exploring synthetic voices. The platform utilizes Eleven's proprietary Voice Design tool to generate unique, multilingual voices based on parameters such as age, gender, and accent. Users can share their created voices and use voices shared by others for a variety of applications, with incentives for participation. Eleven has plans for future expansion and improvements to browsing, search, and categorization.

[### Creator of popular FlanT5 models raises $58m round (3 minute read)](https://reka.ai/announcing-our-58m-funding-to-build-generative-models-and-advance-ai-research/?utm_source=tldrai)

Another crack team is taking a shot at building ubiquitous language and multimodal models for enterprise. They have a solid technical background with a long history of reproducible research. Counter to many foundation model startups, they are a remote-first organization.

### Research & Innovation

[### Kosmos-2 multimodal AI (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14824?utm_source=tldrai)

The UniLM team at Microsoft is an extremely productive and prolific group of researchers. This latest work continues their line of inquiry around useful and powerful language+ models. Kosmos-2 can draw bounding boxes and read text.

[### Evaluate LLM performance on your own data (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13651v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Language model performance is often evaluated on a very small curated selection of data. The distribution of this data is often massively simplified from production environments. Using self-supervised evaluation, you can use your own data sets to evaluate these models. You can even use data that's streaming in from production.

[### Enhancing Visual Instruction Tuning in Large Multi-modal Models (5 minute read)](https://fuxiaoliu.github.io/LRV/?utm_source=tldrai)

The paper presents a new, expansive dataset called Large-scale Robust Visual (LRV)-Instruction, which helps in addressing the issue of multi-modal models creating incorrect descriptions of images and instructions. This dataset, enriched with both positive and negative visual instructions, helps to refine models, reduce hallucinations, and improve overall performance in interpreting visual cues based on diverse instruction formats.
