### Research & Innovation

[### Speed up cold boot times for Llama 2 (6 minute read)](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/loading-llama-2-70b-20x-faster-with-anyscale-endpoints?utm_source=tldrai)

Loading a model from cloud storage to a node GPU often takes most of the time for inference. With a few clever tricks like memory streaming, Anyscale has reduced it 20x to just arrived 30s for Llama 2 70B.

[### Text Embeddings reveal almost as much as text (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06816?utm_source=tldrai)

Using iterative re-embedding and treating embedding inversion as a conditional generation problem allows attackers to successfully recreate 92% of the embedded texts just with access to the dense vectors.

[### Enhanced Segmentation with SAM-OCTA (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07183v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have improved the segmentation of specific targets in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images with a method called SAM-OCTA.

### Engineering & Resources

[### ScaleCrafter: High-Resolution Image Generation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/yingqinghe/scalecrafter?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers studied how to produce high-quality images at large sizes using pre-trained diffusion models trained on smaller images. They discovered issues with repeated patterns in the bigger images and pinpointed the problem to the limited perception of the model's structures.

[### Improving Text to Image Generation with LLMs (4 minute read)](https://minidalle3.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers are improving how we communicate with text-to-image models, like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, which currently require complex prompts for generating images. They've introduced "interactive text to image", allowing people to naturally interact with Large Language Models for better image creation and related tasks.

[### The big AI and robotics concept that has attracted both Walmart and Softbank (8 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/07/a-big-ai-and-robotics-idea-that-has-attracted-walmart-and-softbank.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Symbotic and Softbank have created a joint venture called GreenBox Systems that promises to deliver AI-powered logistics and warehousing to small companies. It will provide its services in facilities that different companies will share. GreenBox aims to help companies that can't afford the multi-million dollar investments required to build and operate such facilities in the same way cloud companies make high-end compute tech accessible.
