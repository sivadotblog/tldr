When LLMs fail, it's rarely about the model's raw power. Turing's ‚ÄúMaximizing Your LLM ROI‚Äù whitepaper shows how the real culprits ‚Äî misaligned training, poor evaluation, and optimization gaps ‚Äî can quietly sabotage ROI.

Inside, you'll learn how to:

‚óè Reduce hidden inefficiencies that drive up LLM costs

‚óè Strengthen evaluation techniques for higher accuracy and reliability

‚óè Build an AI strategy that maximizes performance and business value
