### Headlines & Launches

[### Adobe Announced Video Models (4 minute read)](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/10/14/generate-video-beta-on-firefly-web-app?utm_source=tldrai)

Adobe announced the expansion of its Firefly family of creative generative AI models to video during the Adobe MAX conference.

[### OpenAI appoints international expansion boss (3 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/09/openai_appoints_international_expansion_boss/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has appointed Oliver Jay to lead international expansion, focusing on AI strategy and operations. The company announced a new APAC office in Singapore and is developing local language datasets. The o1 model, which utilizes "chain of thought" techniques, is aimed at enhancing AI accuracy.

[### Microsoft may have an audio-to-image generator in the works (2 minute read)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-may-have-an-audio-to-image-generator-in-the-works-new-patent-shows/?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft has filed a patent for an AI system that converts live audio into images using LLMs. The system aims to enhance communication by generating real-time images from audio streams. If developed, it could be integrated into Microsoft Teams via Copilot.

### Research & Innovation

[### Motion Prediction with SmartPretrain (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08669v1?utm_source=tldrai)

SmartPretrain introduces a flexible, model-agnostic, and dataset-agnostic self-supervised learning framework for improving motion prediction in autonomous vehicles.

[### 10B Distributed training run (16 minute read)](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/intellect-1?utm_source=tldrai)

Decentralized training of language models is the process of using heterogeneous and non-co-located hardware to train a single model. This is traditionally challenging due to the high cost of memory transfers. This work improves on the state-of-the-art algorithms for highly distributed training.

[### Vision-Language Segmentation (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08021v1?utm_source=tldrai)

OneRef introduces a streamlined framework for referring segmentation by unifying visual and language feature spaces into a single transformer.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Diffusion model simulating CS:GO (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/eloialonso/diamond/tree/csgo?utm_source=tldrai)

An open replication of a diffusion model that simulates the visuals of a video game while taking keyboard and mouse controls as input.

[### UvA - An Introduction to Group Equivariant Deep Learning (18 minute read)](https://uvagedl.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

Study resources for learning more about deep learning techniques over certain types of geometric data in the face of architectural constraints.

[### Improving LLM Preference Alignment with Reward-Aware Learning (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference?utm_source=tldrai)

This study tackles the limitations of current alignment algorithms in LLMs, which often overfit to relative preferences and overlook the quality of responses. By introducing reward-conditioned LLM policies, the authors propose a novel data relabeling technique that factors in response quality, helping the model generalize to optimal responses.

[### Al Will Take Over Human Systems From Within (37 minute read)](https://www.noemamag.com/al-will-take-over-human-systems-from-within/?utm_source=tldrai)

In this post, Yuval Noah Harari, an Israeli historian and the author of ‚ÄúSapiens,‚Äù ‚ÄúHomo Deus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNexus,‚Äù discusses the role of information networks and AI in shaping narratives that can unify or divide societies. He warns that AI, acting as an "alien intelligence," may centralize power and that it lacks self-correcting mechanisms, posing risks to democratic structures. Harari emphasizes the need for strong institutions to manage truth in a landscape dominated by powerful AI systems that influence decision-making across various sectors.

[### Sticky humans in a post-AGI world (11 minute read)](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/sticky-humans-in-a-post-agi-world?utm_source=tldrai)

AI tutors face significant challenges in replicating the social and intellectual engagement provided by human teachers. Despite advancements, AI struggles with nuanced educational tasks and lacks the ability to provide the socio-intellectual experiences that humans offer. A hybrid approach, where AI augments rather than replaces human educators, may be more effective due to the inherent social and cultural components of learning.

[### Anthropic challenges OpenAI with affordable batch processing (4 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-challenges-openai-with-affordable-batch-processing/?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic launched a Message Batches API that allows businesses to process large data volumes at half the cost of standard API calls. The API supports up to 10,000 asynchronous queries within 24 hours, offering a cost-effective option that shifts AI processing from real-time to "right-time." This move promotes AI adoption among mid-sized businesses, though it risks diverting focus from advancing real-time AI capabilities.
