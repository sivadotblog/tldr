### Research & Innovation

[### Large diffusion language model (8 minute read)](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/?utm_source=tldrai)

Large scale training of a diffusion model for language that matches LLaMA 3 8B in performance across many benchmarks.

[### Speeding Up LLM Inference with CopySpec (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08923v1?utm_source=tldrai)

CopySpec is a method that accelerates LLM inference by identifying and copying repeated sequences in chat history without extra GPU memory usage. It achieves up to 3.08x speed-up on specific tasks and integrates effectively with speculative decoding for additional gains.

[### Evaluating LLMs Without Human Judgment (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09316v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers introduce a benchmark that assesses LLM open-ended text generation using n-gram statistics and rules, avoiding reliance on human or LLM-based judgments. It closely correlates with GPT-4o evaluations while being computationally efficient.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Measuring LLMs Memory (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/1azybug/forgettingcurve?utm_source=tldrai)

This study explores the limitations of existing methods for evaluating the memory capacity of language models. It introduces the "forgetting curve," a new approach for assessing how well models retain information over long contexts.

[### Indoor Navigation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/dillonloh/adavln?utm_source=tldrai)

AdaSimulator provides a physics-enabled environment for studying Visual Language Navigation (VLN) in realistic settings.

[### Step Audio Chat (Hugging Face Hub)](https://huggingface.co/stepfun-ai/Step-Audio-Chat?utm_source=tldrai)

This is the Multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) component of Step-Audio. It is a 130-billion-parameter multimodal LLM that is responsible for understanding and generating human speech. The model is specifically designed to seamlessly integrate functions such as speech recognition, semantic understanding, dialogue management, voice cloning, and speech generation.

[### US' First Major AI Copyright Ruling (2 minute read)](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/surprise-move-judge-walks-back-ai-6219521/?utm_source=tldrai)

A U.S. judge ruled that Ross Intelligence infringed on Thomson Reuters' copyright by using Westlaw headnotes to train its AI. The decision may influence other AI-related copyright lawsuits but remains narrowly focused on non-generative AI applications.

[### Red Hat's take on open-source AI: Pragmatism over utopian dreams (4 minute read)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hats-take-on-open-source-ai-pragmatism-over-utopian-dreams/?utm_source=tldrai)

Red Hat emphasizes a pragmatic approach to open-source AI, focusing on practical enterprise needs rather than chasing AGI. Challenges include reconciling transparency with competitive realities, especially regarding open-source AI's opacity in training data and model weights. Red Hat aims to foster collaboration, avoiding vendor lock-in, while acknowledging the complexities of AI compared to traditional open-source software.

[### The EU AI Act is Coming to America (9 minute read)](https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/the-eu-ai-act-is-coming-to-america?utm_source=tldrai)

Although federal leadership seems wary of heavy AI regulations, many US states are implementing legislation modeled on Europe's AI Act. This article outlines how ‚Äúalgorithmic discrimination‚Äù laws, inspired by EU rules, could create detailed impact assessments, require compliance paperwork, and impose liability on AI deployments‚Äîraising the real prospect of higher operating costs for teams building AI systems.
