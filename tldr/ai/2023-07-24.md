[### Towards a unified agent with foundation models (30 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09668?utm_source=tldrai)

There is an emerging idea that language is a powerful bed for planning. In this way, plugging in powerful language models to systems that require planning should improve those systems. For a challenging sparse reward environment, this turns out to be the case. The proposed method has improved data utility, adaptability, and general performance over a baseline.

[### Exploring Factual Knowledge Boundaries of LLMs (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11019v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This research investigates the factual knowledge boundaries of LLMs and how retrieval augmentation can improve their performance and judgment in knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering. Findings indicate that while LLMs tend to overestimate their abilities to answer questions, retrieval augmentation can help them become more aware of their knowledge boundaries and improve their judgment, though their reliance on the provided retrieval results significantly impacts their performance.
