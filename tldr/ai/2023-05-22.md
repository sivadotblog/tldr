[### A Super Language Translator: The mLongT5 Story (4 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11129?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers built a powerful tool called mLongT5 that can understand and translate long texts in multiple languages. It outperforms other similar tools in tasks like summarizing text and answering questions in various languages.

[### Boosting Language Models with Real-world Knowledge: The New Fine-tuning Approach (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10626?utm_source=tldrai)

Authors have designed a new way to teach language models to understand and plan in the real world by using a virtual simulator to give them 'embodied experiences.' This new method significantly improves the models' abilities and makes smaller models perform as well as, or even better than, larger models like ChatGPT.

[### DragGAN: A User-Interactive Method for Image Manipulation (3 minute read)](https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/DragGAN/?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a tool named DragGAN, which allows users to modify images precisely by dragging any point in the image to a target location, enabling changes in pose, shape, expression, and layout. It outperforms existing image manipulation methods, proving its efficiency not only in creating realistic results but also in tracking changes, even when manipulating real images.
