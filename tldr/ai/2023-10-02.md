[### Gretel trained an LLM on 500BN tokens of public tabular datasets to generate better synthetic data (Sponsor)](https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k)

Gretel's novel [tabular large language model](https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k) reliably generates synthetic tabular data with [zero-shot prompting](https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k). You can use it to create a [new correlated dataset](https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k) with the correct datatypes, based on an SQL schema or query; or to [expand existing datasets](https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k) by automatically adding columns and records, or filling in gaps and null values.

The LLM was trained on half a trillion tokens of public data and generates [highly realistic tables](https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k) while ensuring relationships between records remain consistent. It‚Äôs even aware of regional differences (company names, emails, etc.) [Request early access here](https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k)

[### Vision Transformers need registers (30 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16588?utm_source=tldrai)

One of the coolest and simplest vision papers in recent weeks. Vision Transformers use "useless" pixel values as places to store global information. This makes attention maps uninterpretable. However, if you add a simple [reg] token to the vocabulary, the model will use it and won't store information in pixel values.
