### Headlines & Launches

[### Grok API (4 minute read)](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models#models-and-pricing?utm_source=tldrai)

Grok 3 has an API for its models, including multiple reasoning modes. This link includes pricing, which is reasonable given the assumed size of the model itself.

[### Google Ironwood TPU (7 minute read)](https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/ironwood-tpu-age-of-inference/?utm_source=tldrai)

With improvements on podsize, bandwidth, memory, and overall flops, the 7th generation of Google's TPUs is a step change improvement over any chip on the market.

[### Claude's Max Plan (2 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/max-plan?utm_source=tldrai)

The new Max plan for Claude offers expanded usage with priority access to features and models, supporting users with demanding projects. It provides two levels: Expanded Usage for $100/month with 5x usage and Maximum Flexibility for $200/month with 20x usage. The plan is ideal for those who frequently work with substantial documents and complex data.

### Research & Innovation

[### Omni SVG (9 minute read)](https://omnisvg.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

By treating SVGs as a foreign language, a pretrained Qwen model can generate novel SVGs based on text and images. It is easily the state-of-the-art model. An open release is coming soon.

[### AI Scientist v2 (PDF)](https://pub.sakana.ai/ai-scientist-v2/paper/paper.pdf?utm_source=tldrai)

Sakana AI had a research paper accepted to an ICLR workshop that was fully generated, executed, and written by a language model system. They improved their system by using VLMs, more general purpose search, and more.

[### OLMoTrace (17 minute read)](https://allenai.org/blog/olmotrace?utm_source=tldrai)

There is a debate in the language modeling world about how much a model actually learns and how much it just memorizes. This feature, in the AI2 Playground, searches through billions of input documents, in real time, to figure out if the output of a model is just regurgitated or if it is novel. It includes the source of the utterance from multiple documents.
