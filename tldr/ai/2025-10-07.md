Users can interact with a set of limited apps directly within ChatGPT using MCP connectors. The company demoed searching hotels with Booking.com, researching houses with Zillow, and designing presentations with Canva.

OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs over multiple years, starting with 1 gigawatt in late 2026. If the deal is fully exercised, OpenAI would acquire 10% of AMD.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Why do LLMs freak out over the seahorse emoji? (14 minute read)](https://vgel.me/posts/seahorse/?utm_source=tldrai)

Large language models are very confident that there is a seahorse emoji. The emoji has never existed, despite some Redditors claiming it did. This post takes a look at why models might do this. Models just don't know that their belief about a seahorse emoji existing is wrong - they can only assume that 'seahorse + emoji' will produce the tokens it wants.

[### OpenAI Is Good at Deals (24 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-10-06/openai-is-good-at-deals?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1OTgxMzk5NywiZXhwIjoxNzYwNDE4Nzk3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUM1EwSFpHUEw0R0EwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.gXyol5FFBAd1hXETehRW5k9CCDqlE3gSUuuidIyPcXQ&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

Whenever OpenAI announces a big partnership with a public company, that company's stock will go up. OpenAI is using that stock value to subsidize deals. Its deal with AMD involves OpenAI receiving warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares at 1 cent per share, awarded in phases if OpenAI hits certain milestones for deployment. AMD's stock price also has to increase for the warrants to be exercised. While OpenAI is not publicly traded, it is increasingly making waves in the stock market.

[### Why Can't Transformers Learn Multiplication? Reverse-Engineering Reveals Long-Range Dependency Pitfalls (28 minute read)](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00184?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers reverse-engineered why language models fail at simple 4√ó4 multiplication and found successful models naturally built tree-like attention patterns that "cache" intermediate calculations then retrieve them later, like jotting down a thought on scratch paper. Standard training fails because models learn the easy outer digits first, but get stuck on the middle digits. By adding a simple auxiliary loss that forces the model to predict running totals at each step, models dramatically improve.
