[### üéØ Master the art of model selection in this recorded session (Sponsor)](https://octo.ai/cp/webinar-path-to-production-model-selection/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=p2p-model-select-webinar)

OctoAI's experts will show you how to avoid "model fatigue" and pick the perfect open-source model for your project.

In this video, you'll learn how to:

* Narrow down the vast universe of models to a shortlist tailored to your needs
* Decide between checkpoints, LoRAs, and Community tunes for your specific use case
* Evaluate model success across prompts, data, training, and tuning
