[### Chinese AI Developers Say They Can't Beat America Without Better Chips (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/china-ai-race-us-chips-9e74b957?st=ChPQAw&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrai)

Some elite Chinese AI researchers estimate that the country's chances of catching up to the US are slim in the short run due to a bottleneck in chips. US rules block the direct sale of Nvidia chips to China. Chinese companies can rent Nvidia chips in third countries, but this typically leaves developers with fewer chips and more inconvenience compared with well-funded competitors in the US. The US recently unblocked sales of Nvidia's H200 chip to China, but this is not likely to be a game-changer in helping Chinese companies catch up.

[### Nvidia's Achilles Heel: Inference (5 minute read)](https://x.com/ericvishria/status/2011603021957120374?utm_source=tldrai)

Benchmark's Eric Vishria shares his email to investors about Nvidia from 2024. Nvidia's dominance holds in training, but GenAI inference is emerging as the weak spot. Purpose-built SRAM architectures from players like Groq and Cerebras deliver order-of-magnitude faster inference than GPUs, unlocking larger models, lower latency, and new use cases. As inference becomes a growing share of spend, performance gaps could shift AI compute winners away from incumbents.

[### On neural scaling and the quanta hypothesis (99 minute read)](https://ericjmichaud.com/quanta/?utm_source=tldrai)

Humanity started an experiment in scaling up deep neural networks several years ago. The experiment is on track to be the most expensive ever attempted, and we don't yet know what the results of the experiment will be. Despite its importance, there isn't a mature theory backing the experiment. We don't really know how to think about what neural networks are doing internally. The number of people working on such a theory in public is relatively small.

[### AI is everywhere, but nowhere in recent productivity data (5 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/forrester_ai_jobs_impact/?utm_source=tldrai)

Forrester's J.P. Gownder argues that AI hasn't yet boosted productivity, similar to how PCs didn't immediately impact productivity metrics. His research suggests AI could replace 6% of jobs by 2030, with many companies yet to see tangible ROI from AI projects. He contrasts AI's slow job-replacement with previous shifts like outsourcing, highlighting financial decisions rather than direct AI replacements driving current job losses.
