[### AGI Is Not Multimodal (16 minute read)](https://thegradient.pub/agi-is-not-multimodal/?utm_source=tldrai)

The multimodal approach, in which massive modular networks are optimized for an array of modalities that taken together appear general, will not lead to human-level AGI. Instead, we should pursue approaches to intelligence that treat embodiment and interaction with the environment as primary and see modality centered processing as emergent phenomena. True AGI needs a physical understanding of the world, as many problems can't be converted into a problem of symbol manipulation. The most challenging mathematical piece of the AGI has likely already been solved - what's left is to inventory the functions we need and determine how they should be arranged into a coherent whole.

[### Codex, Jules, and the Future of Async AI Agents (6 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1928557330964115484.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Codex and Jules show how async AI agents can run tasks independently, expanding beyond linear chat interactions. Future agents will support features like intelligent checkpointing, multi-branch exploration, and task-tracking inboxes to manage parallel workflows. Async agents improve cognitive bandwidth by letting users review outputs on their terms without breaking focus.

[### Introducing our Dev Mode MCP server: Bringing Figma into your workflow (7 minute read)](https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-dev-mode-mcp-server/?utm_source=tldrai)

Figma's Dev Mode MCP server allows developers to bring context from Figma into agent coding tools. The server provides a more efficient and accurate design-to-code workflow for creating new atomic components, building out multi-layer application flows, and more. It is still in beta. Figma plans to release a slew of updates over the coming months, including features like remote server capabilities and deeper code base integrations.

[### Large Language Models Often Know When They Are Being Evaluated (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23836?utm_source=tldrai)

Frontier models can distinguish evaluation scenarios from real-world interactions with 83% accuracy, often explicitly reasoning about evaluation indicators like "multiple-choice format" or recognizing specific benchmarks from their training data. More advanced models exhibit "meta-reasoning" - using the fact that researchers were asking about their chain-of-thought transcripts as evidence of being evaluated. This raises concerns that models could underperform on tests or fake alignment during evaluations and behave differently once deployed.

[### Cloud Run GPUs, now GA, makes running AI workloads easier for everyone (5 minute read)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-run-gpus-are-now-generally-available?utm_source=tldrai)

NVIDIA GPU support for Cloud Run, Google Cloud's serverless runtime, is now generally available. Support for GPUs in Cloud Run makes Google Cloud's GPU-accelerated applications simpler, faster, and more cost-effective than ever before. Users are only charged for the GPU resources they consume, down to the second - Cloud Run automatically scales GPU instances down to zero when no requests are received, eliminating idle costs. It features rapid startup and scaling and full streaming support.
