### Headlines & Launches

[### New ways to manage your data in ChatGPT (2 minute read)](https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrai)

ChatGPT users can now turn off chat history, allowing you to choose which conversations can be used to train our models. OpenAI is also working on a new ChatGPT Business subscription for professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.

[### Anthropic partners with Scale (1 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/index/partnering-with-scale?utm_source=tldrai)

With its push towards commercialization, Anthropic announces its partnership with Scale to make use of their model monitoring, deployment solutions, security, and data integrations. It makes sense as a partnership and improves the competition for these models.

[### Stability AI upscale models (2 minute read)](https://stability.ai/blog/stability-ai-releases-image-upscaling-api?utm_source=tldrai)

Most synthetically generated images are 512x512, which is computationally convenient but quite small. After the images are generated they often need to be upscaled. There are two open models that power the new Upscaling API: ESRGAN and SD Latent Upscaler. The API is also integrated into the photoshop and blender plugins.

### Research & Innovation

[### How to train LLMs to be competent and ethical (36 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03279?utm_source=tldrai)

One negative side effect of training agents to maximize reward is that they often become power seeking, meaning they try to increase their resources and access to information. This is a novel finding and somewhat hard to measure, this paper introduces a benchmark to help understand the power seeking behavior of these language models. Additionally, they give insights on how to train models to both act with high utility and according to moral guidelines. The world needs more high quality benchmarks and this is an excellent step in that direction.

[### Language models for planning (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11477?utm_source=tldrai)

Language models are great at producing plausible text and in certain cases reasonable plans. However, in general, they fail to generate long horizon plans. Without changing the model at all, even via fine-tuning, with special prompts we can dramatically improve the success of both plan generation and plan execution. Specifically, language models generate a plan language (fed a few-shot example) and that plan is executed by an actual planner then the resulting plans are translated back to natural language. The improvement is massive.

[### Machine Translation Needs Attention (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12776?utm_source=tldrai)

The Structured State Spaces for Sequences (S4) model, successful in various tasks, is applied to Machine Translation (MT), but lags behind the Transformer by 4 BLEU points and struggles with long sentences. This gap is attributed to S4's inability to summarize full source sentences in a single hidden state, which can be remedied by introducing an attention mechanism.

### Engineering & Resources

[### DeepFloyd IF code released (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/deep-floyd/IF?utm_source=tldrai)

The next image model from Stability AI has a code release. The model weights, blog, inference, and tooling will be coming in a few days. It is a multi-stage model with a frozen T5 text encoder and two super resolution models. One big win here is the ability to render extremely high quality text. The claim is that this model will likely be for research only at first, then open after some community feedback.

[### 167k patent summaries (HuggingFace Dataset)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhengyun21/PMC-Patients?utm_source=tldrai)

PMC-Patients is a unique dataset that includes 167,000 patient summaries extracted from case reports in PubMed Central (PMC), along with 3.1 million patient-article relevance and 293,000 patient-patient similarity annotations. The dataset is intended for use in Retrieval-based Clinical Decision Support (ReCDS) systems and includes two benchmark tasks: Patient-to-Article Retrieval (PAR) and Patient-to-Patient Retrieval (PPR). The details on the tasks and leaderboards can be found in the paper.

[### PoseVocab: Learning Pose Embeddings for Human Avatar Modeling (5 minute read)](https://lizhe00.github.io/projects/posevocab/?utm_source=tldrai)

PoseVocab, a novel pose encoding method for human avatar modeling, constructs key poses and latent embeddings to effectively encode dynamic human appearances and achieve pose generalization and temporal consistency. The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in synthesis quality through the use of feature lines, a compact 3D representation, and a hierarchical query strategy for interpolating pose embeddings.

[### Why do we need RL for language models? (7 minute read)](https://gist.github.com/yoavg/6bff0fecd65950898eba1bb321cfbd81?utm_source=tldrai)

Most folks are, rightfully, concerned about hallucination in generative language models. There is a vocal community advocating for retrieval as the way to combat this. This may well be true, but comes with a potential host of other problems. One argument, however, is that changing the learning objective from pure expert imitation via next token prediction - to an RL objective that allows the model to get negative feedback and propose knowledge seeking queries.
