[### Baseten launches Model APIs and Training infrastructure built for production AI (Sponsor)](https://www.baseten.com/products/model-apis/?utm_source=affiliates&amp;utm_medium=tldr_tech&amp;utm_campaign=5_30_primary_tldrutm_term=utm_content=newsletter)

Model APIs

Baseten just launched Model APIs, on-demand frontier models including DeepSeek V3, R1, Llama Maverick and Scout, purpose-built for production workloads on their optimized Inference Stack. [Try them out](https://www.baseten.com/products/model-apis/?utm_source=affiliates&utm_medium=tldr_tech&utm_campaign=5_30_primary_tldrutm_term=utm_content=newsletter).

📈Top of the [OpenRouter leaderboard](https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324/providers?sort=latency) in latency and throughput.

🛠️Support tool calling and structured outputs out of the box, ideal for agents.

🤝Fully OpenAI-compatible, so Model APIs can be used as drop-in replacements.

🧪More pre-optimized models are added regularly.

Training

Because one product launch isn't enough, Baseten also released Training (Beta). Built for power users, Training provides the infrastructure to fine-tune without limits using any model or dataset.

[### Web Bench - A new way to compare AI Browser Agents (7 minute read)](https://blog.skyvern.com/web-bench-a-new-way-to-compare-ai-browser-agents/?utm_source=tldrai)

Web Bench is a new dataset for evaluating web browsing agents. It consists of 5,750 tasks on 452 different websites. Anthropic Sonnet 3.7 CUA is currently state-of-the-art according to Web Bench.

[### Chatterbox Text-to-Speech (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox?utm_source=tldrai)

Resemble AI released an open-source TTS model that outperforms ElevenLabs in benchmarks and features emotion exaggeration controls.

[### Global Illumination with RenderFormer (GitHub Repo)](https://microsoft.github.io/renderformer/?utm_source=tldrai)

RenderFormer is a neural renderer that produces photorealistic images directly from triangle-based scene representations with full global illumination. It doesn't require any per-scene training or fine-tuning.

[### Cheaper VLM Training (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/zero?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta researchers introduced a method called zero-shot grafting, which trains a vision encoder with a smaller surrogate model derived from a large LLM's shallow layers. This reduces VLM training costs by ~45% while preserving or even improving performance when transferred to the full LLM.

### Miscellaneous

[### A recent clarity that I gained is viewing AI research as a “max-performance domain” (2 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1928174505148698909.html?utm_source=tldrai)

'Max-performance domains' are industries where people can be world-class by being very good at only one part of their job. It doesn't matter if you're incompetent at adjacent skills as long as you can create seminal impact. Exceptional ability at a single thing outweighs incompetence at other parts of the job. It is a luxury to work in a max-performance domain as failure is allowed and stress is usually self-imposed.

[### 1000x Increase in AI Demand (2 minute read)](https://tomtunguz.com/nvda-2025-05-29/?utm_source=tldrai)

NVIDIA reports notable growth with a shift from simple AI to more complex reasoning, driving a massive increase in AI demand. Hyperscalers are deploying nearly 72,000 GPUs weekly, with Microsoft alone seeing a fivefold increase in token generation. Increased demand requires more data centers, termed "AI factories," despite efforts to reduce model sizes.
