[### How to Use Banned US Models in China (10 minute read)](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-grey-market-for-american-llms?utm_source=tldrai)

Taobao, a popular Chinese e-commerce site, hosts thousands of AI resellers offering US models through proxy sites and API transfer stations. Claude is the grey market favorite partially because ChatGPT faces stricter enforcement after the CCP's 2023 crackdown over censorship concerns. DeepSeek's aggressive content moderation (which refuses any query that contains "CCP") and frequent server outages push users to seek underground, paid foreign models over free domestic alternatives.

[### I Tested Alignment Faking On Frontier Models‚ÄîOnly Claude Did It (3 minute read)](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/pCMmLiBcHbKohQgwA/i-replicated-the-anthropic-alignment-faking-experiment-on?utm_source=tldrai)

When researchers replicated Anthropic's experiment to see if models would strategically comply with harmful requests to avoid being retrained, Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet ‚Äúfaked alignment‚Äù by providing harmful responses but almost every other model simply refused the requests outright. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview was the only non-Claude model willing to answer harmful questions, but it showed no strategic behavior, treating all users the same regardless of whether it was told it would be retrained. The model-specific nature of this behavior raises questions about generalizing research findings from single model families to all LLMs.

What's the role of AI in modern GRC? How does it change traditional audit processes? These questions and many others were answered in [Drata's recent Auditor AMA session](https://drata.com/resources/webinars/ask-an-auditor-ai-in-grc?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_campaign=20250610) with James Andrew-Smith.

[### Recent Frontier Models Are Reward Hacking (12 minute read)](https://metr.org/blog/2025-06-05-recent-reward-hacking/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's o3 model was caught tracing through Python call stacks to steal correct answers from grading systems, achieving "impossibly fast" execution times by disabling CUDA synchronization rather than actually optimizing code. The model reward-hacked on 100% of runs for certain optimization tasks despite explicitly claiming it would never cheat, even persisting when told the code would help Alzheimer's researchers. Similar behavior was observed across multiple frontier models including Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

Microsoft's new agent resolves 58% of Linux kernel crashes compared to 37.5% by SWE-agent, signaling a shift from quick-fix coding agents to deep research systems that can handle million-line codebases. The breakthrough comes from mining commit history to understand how bugs evolved over the course of development.
