### Headlines & Launches

[### Harvey raises $300m series D (3 minute read)](https://www.harvey.ai/blog/harvey-raises-series-d?utm_source=tldrai)

The legal AI startup Harvey raised a substantial sum in a funding round led by Sequoia to continue building tools for law firms.

[### Apple Exploring Humanoid Robots (2 minute read)](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-humanoid-robot-in-development/?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple is in the early proof-of-concept stage for both humanoid and non-humanoid robots, with potential mass production not expected until 2028 or later.

[### OpenAI's Roadmap for GPT-5 (1 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1889755723078443244.html?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI plans to release GPT-4.5 as its last non-chain-of-thought model before launching GPT-5, which will unify its o-series and GPT-series models.

### Research & Innovation

[### Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI paper about using their o series of reasoning models in competitive programming. They find that originally they had to use hand crafted inference strategies, but later versions of o3 scored well without human intervention.

[### 100 Billion images for VLM pre-training (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07617?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepMind scaled vision language model training to a substantially higher data scale than was previously attempted. Western-centric tasks saturate quickly. However, performance on diverse global tasks continues to improve. Interestingly, this improvement is rarely captured by existing benchmarks.

[### DeepScaleR: Surpassing O1-Preview with a 1.5B Model by Scaling RL (14 minute read)](https://pretty-radio-b75.notion.site/DeepScaleR-Surpassing-O1-Preview-with-a-1-5B-Model-by-Scaling-RL-19681902c1468005bed8ca303013a4e2?utm_source=tldrai)

Most of the research that makes such dramatic claims is easily falsifiable. This is a unique work in that the methods are quite sound. One cool finding the researchers made is that by gradually increasing the context length during RL training, they could smoothly improve AIME performance without wasting compute.

### Engineering & Resources

[### ESM2 in Equinox (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/esm2quinox?utm_source=tldrai)

ESM2 is a great protein folding model. This is a well-maintained version in a popular Jax package.

[### Page Assist (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/n4ze3m/page-assist?utm_source=tldrai)

One of many new tools for web browsing with local language models.

[### Data Formulator (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator?utm_source=tldrai)

A great little tool from Microsoft that uses language models to create charts and answer questions about datasets. It unfortunately doesn't support local models, but works well with an API key.
