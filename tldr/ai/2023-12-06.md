### Research & Innovation

[### Tracking with 3D Gaussian Splatting (8 minute read)](https://spla-tam.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

Gaussian Splatting is an amazing method for 3D reconstruction. In this case, the scientists are working to remove COLMAP from their visual mapping and tracking systems. The results are compelling, though there is still some heavy computation that needs to happen.

[### Deep dive: recent advances in instruction tuning (12 minute read)](https://gaotianyu.xyz/blog/2023/11/30/instruction-tuning/?utm_source=tldrai)

Language models vastly improved in usefulness after instruction tuning was introduced. There have been many recent advances like synthetic data pipelines that make the process better and more efficient.

[### Language Model Self-Teaching for Domain Adaptation (14 minute read)](https://morph.so/blog/self-teaching/?utm_source=tldrai)

When trying to use language models in domains that require niche knowledge, you can either fine-tune or use some retrieval techniques. Both have drawbacks. This novel method uses self-generated synthetic data to better learn the information at test time. It shows marked improvements in standard adaptation benchmarks over both fine-tuning and RAG.
