[### Google‚Äôs Gemini Marketing Trick (3 minute read)](https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/googles-gemini-marketing-trick?utm_source=tldrai)

Why did Google, arguably the pioneer of all things generative AI, feel the need to juice its marketing around the launch of Gemini? It boggles the mind and shows just how much is at stake here in the game of winner-takes-all in AI.

[### Vertical AI (14 minute read)](https://greylock.com/greymatter/vertical-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Horizontal software, software designed to solve a user's pain regardless of the type of user that feels it, has defined the last 10 years of SaaS. Vertical SaaS, by contrast, is designed for a single or narrow user set, enabling the solution to be tailored to their needs. In this article, a Greylock partner forecasts that moving forward, users‚Äô expectations around tailored services will govern how we build software.

[### Why The AI Act Was So Hard To Pass (5 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999849/eu-ai-act-artificial-intelligence-regulations-complicated-delays?utm_source=tldrai)

The EU's AI Act, after a lengthy negotiation process and last-minute debates over facial recognition and foundational AI models, reached a provisional deal that could set a blueprint for global AI regulation. The Act, which categorizes AI systems based on risk, includes a two-tier system for general-purpose AI Systems and provisions for systems posing an "unacceptable" risk. It faces the challenge of adapting to rapidly evolving AI technologies.
