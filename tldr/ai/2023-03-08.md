### Headlines & Launches

[### Salesforce $250mm generative AI fund (2 minute read)](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/generative-ai-investing/?utm_source=tldrai)

Initially investing in Cohere, Anthropic, You.com, and HealthAI this new fund will focus on accelerating generative AI companies across the board. They want to work with companies that will impact a user's daily workflow.

[### Stability AI acquires ClipDrop (1 minute read)](https://stability.ai/blog/stability-ai-acquires-init-ml-makers-of-clipdrop-application?utm_source=tldrai)

Started in 2020, ClipDrop is a fantastic computer vision application that allows you to edit images with various AI enhanced tools. They plan to integrate future Stability models natively into ClipDrop which already has over 15 million users.

[### State of competitive ML 2022 (14 minute read)](https://mlcontests.com/state-of-competitive-machine-learning-2022/?utm_source=tldrai)

Competitive ML is an ever growing field it is often hard to keep up, here are some highlights from 2022. Kaggle is still the most dominant platform for data science competitions, but there are other platforms with decent prize money. Python is the most commonly used language and 96% of Deep Learning solutions used PyTorch - which is up from 77% the prior year. Winners of NLP competitions used Transformers, while computer vision solutions mainly used CNNs. Tabular data competitions were mostly won by GBDTs, with LightGBM being the most popular. Half of the competition winners are first-time winners.

### Research & Innovation

[### PALM-e (4 minute read)](https://palm-e.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

The term ‚Äúpositive transfer‚Äù is somewhat of a holy grail for large scale models. It means that when you train on two modalities, you get better performance than you would have training on just one or the other. This paper from Google shows that training on robot controls, video, and text shows positive transfer between domains. This is hypothesized to be a function of model scale, and this model is an impressive 562 billion parameters.

[### Prismer: A Vision-Language Model with Multi-Modal Experts (5 minute read)](https://shikun.io/projects/prismer?utm_source=tldrai)

The article discusses the high computational and data requirements of large pre-trained models used in vision-language learning, which require massive amounts of image-text data to be trained. The proposed alternative approach involves using separate sub-networks or "experts" for specific tasks, allowing for the use of domain-specific data and architectures that would not be feasible with a single large network. The proposed model, Prismer, is a visually conditioned autoregressive text generation model that utilizes powerful vision-only and language-only models along with modality-specific vision experts for open-ended vision-language reasoning tasks. The expert models are pre-trained and frozen, and connected through lightweight trainable components, comprising only 20% of total network parameters, leading to improved training efficiency and scalability.

[### Davinci Functions (GitHub repo)](https://github.com/odashi/davinci-functions?utm_source=tldrai)

There are common things you want to do with large language models such as text-divinci-003 such as write a list, answer a question, or verify a statement. This repo provides some simple tools for doing those tasks. It is a cool step towards building an abstraction layer on top of these models.

[### Nerflets: Local Radiance Fields for Efficient Structure-Aware 3D Scene Representation from 2D Supervision (5 minute read)](https://jetd1.github.io/nerflets-web/?utm_source=tldrai)

The paper introduces "Nerflets," a local neural radiance field that represents a 3D scene efficiently and with structure awareness. Nerflets are composed of multiple neural radiance fields that maintain their own spatial position, orientation, and extent to contribute to panoptic, density, and radiance reconstructions. By using only photometric and inferred panoptic image supervision, Nerflets allow the extraction of panoptic and photometric renderings from arbitrary views, and enable tasks rare for NeRFs, such as 3D panoptic segmentation and interactive editing. The experiments show that Nerflets fit and approximate the scene more efficiently than traditional global NeRFs.

[### Code for the current best Attention-Free long context language model (GitHub repo)](https://github.com/HazyResearch/safari/blob/main/standalone_hyena.py?utm_source=tldrai)

The SSM literature has been receiving increased attention recently after S4 showed phenomenal performance on the long range arena benchmark. The latest work in the series has closed the gap on language modeling tasks with attention based Transformers while scaling to 10x longer context 100x faster.
