### Headlines & Launches

[### Runway's Gen 3 Video Model (6 minute read)](https://runwayml.com/blog/introducing-gen-3-alpha/?utm_source=tldrai)

Runway has trained an extremely powerful new video generation model. It will power many of the existing features on its platform. Examples are available in the provided link.

[### DeepMind's New AI Generates Soundtracks And Dialogue For Videos (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/17/deepminds-new-ai-generates-soundtracks-and-dialog-for-videos/?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepMind is developing an AI technology called V2A to generate synchronized soundtracks for videos. It uses diffusion models trained on audio, dialogue transcripts, and video clips to create music, sound effects, and dialogue.

[### Giant Chips Give Supercomputers a Run for Their Money (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cerebras-wafer-scale-engine?utm_source=tldrai)

Cerebras, a California-based company, has demonstrated that its second-generation wafer-scale engine is significantly faster than the world's faster supercomputer in molecular dynamics calculations. It can also perform sparse large language model inference at one-third of the energy cost of a full model without losing any accuracy. Both achievements are possible due to the interconnects and fast memory access enabled by Cerebras' hardware. Cerebras is looking to extend the applications of its wafer-scale engine to a larger class of problems, including molecular dynamics simulations of biological processes and simulations of airflow around vehicles.
