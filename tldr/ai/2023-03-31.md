### Research & Innovation

[### Piano Playing AI (6 minute read)](https://kzakka.com/robopianist/?utm_source=tldrai)

Player pianos have existed since before computers, but now a computer can play the piano by controlling robotic fingers. This is a fascinating control problem that allows an RL agent to learn how to control dexterous fingers to play piano. There is an interactive demo that lets you poke and prod the hands while they play.

[### DreamBooth3D: Personalizing Text-to-3D Generative Models with Few Images (5 minute read)](https://dreambooth3d.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

DreamBooth3D is a new approach that personalizes text-to-3D generative models with as few as 3-6 casually captured images of a subject. The method combines recent advances in personalizing text-to-image models with text-to-3D generation, overcoming the issue of overfitting to input viewpoints through a 3-stage optimization strategy. DreamBooth3D can produce high-quality, subject-specific 3D assets with text-driven modifications such as novel poses, colors, and attributes that are not seen in any of the input images of the subject.

[### HiPer: Personalizing Image Generation and Manipulation with Highly Personalized Text Embedding (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08767?utm_source=tldrai)

The paper presents a new approach called HiPer, which uses highly personalized text embedding to achieve personalization and content manipulation in image generation and manipulation without the need for model fine-tuning or identifiers. The approach enables manipulation of background, texture, and motion with just a single image and target text, producing highly personalized and complex semantic image edits across a wide range of tasks. The authors believe that their novel understanding of the text embedding space has the potential to inspire further research across various tasks.
