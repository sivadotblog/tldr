[### Is AI judging the future of gymnastics or just a surveillance tool? (27 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/c/24182327/olympics-gymnastics-ai-judging-fujitsu-jss-fig?utm_source=tldrai)

The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) has teamed with Fujitsu to launch an AI-assisted judging support system at the World Gymnastics Championships, aiming for fairer, more transparent scoring. The Judging Support System (JSS), which will not replace judges, offers 3D model-based second opinions in difficult cases and inquiry disputes, with scope for future improvements and broader applications. Despite concerns over replacing human judgment, the JSS may enhance scoring accuracy and consistency, vital in a sport where minimal point differences greatly impact rankings and athletes' careers.

[### AI existential risk probabilities are too unreliable to inform policy (25 minute read)](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-existential-risk-probabilities?utm_source=tldrai)

This essay critiques the use of AI existential risk probability estimates for policy making, arguing that they are too unreliable and lack a solid inductive or deductive basis, often resembling educated guesses rather than evidence-based forecasts. The authors challenge the legitimacy of these forecasts in guiding public policy, especially when linked to costly or freedom-limiting actions, and advocate for an evidence-based approach that acknowledges uncertainty in AI progression. They propose focusing on definable AI milestones for more meaningful policy decisions while cautioning against leveraging speculative existential risk probabilities in high-impact decisions.
