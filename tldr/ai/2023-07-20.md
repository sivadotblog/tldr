### Headlines & Launches

[### Apple Tests ‚ÄòApple GPT,‚Äô Develops Generative AI Tools to Catch OpenAI (9 minute read)](https://archive.ph/diZIg?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple is creating an AI framework, Ajax, and a chatbot service, Apple GPT, as part of its push to compete in the large language model space. While Apple's AI efforts are still experimental, insiders anticipate a significant announcement next year.

[### Keras Core is out! (5 minute read)](https://keras.io/keras_core/announcement/?utm_source=tldrai)

Keras Core serves as a preview of what's coming in Keras 3.0 in Fall 2023. Keras Core, a complete reimagining of the Keras codebase, is built upon a modular backend architecture, allowing Keras workflows to operate on any framework, initially including TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch.

[### Llama 2 is the real deal and RLHF was key (12 minute read)](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/llama-2-from-meta?utm_source=tldrai)

While doubling the training corpus certainly helped, folks at Meta claim the reward model and RLHF process was key to getting a safe and useful model for Llama 2's release. If you didn't have time to read the full technical paper, this post is an excellent summary of key ideas from the head of RLHF at HuggingFace.

### Research & Innovation

[### Understanding the Changing Minds of GPT-4 (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09009v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study looks at how updates to popular artificial intelligence language models GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can change their performance in tasks like math problem-solving, answering tricky questions, writing code, and visual thinking.

[### A New Method for Multimodal Learning (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00316?utm_source=tldrai)

The authors of this paper propose SHARCS, a system that learns from different types of data at once, like text, pictures, and sounds. It works by finding common concepts in these different data types and linking them together in a way that's easy to understand, which can help improve predictions and find missing data.

[### Video Object Tracking: A Point-Based Segmentation Approach (4 minute read)](https://www.vis.xyz/pub/sam-pt/?utm_source=tldrai)

This study introduces SAM-PT, a new system that leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve tracking and segmentation of objects in videos. SAM-PT offers superior performance across several video segmentation benchmarks.

### Engineering & Resources

[### RepViT: An Efficient Architecture for Image Recognition (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/THU-MIG/RepViT?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a new kind of lightweight neural network called RepViT by combining the efficient design elements of lightweight Vision Transformers and traditional Convolutional Neural Networks.

[### Impressive dataset for hand object contact estimation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/zc-alexfan/arctic?utm_source=tldrai)

Estimating when hands come into contact with an object is a key challenge for AR/VR and robotics. In deep learning, data is queen. This new large scale dataset contains millions of annotated frames for a variety of tasks such as hand reconstruction, synthetic object motion, and more.

[### Referring Video Object Segmentation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/wudongming97/onlinerefer?utm_source=tldrai)

This repository introduces an efficient online model, OnlineRefer, for Referring Video Object Segmentation, a technique that identifies and segments an object in a video based on human instruction.
