[### Schedule Free Optimization (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/schedule_free?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers from Meta have been teasing a new optimizer on X. They have now released the code along with various integrations. The optimizer has no LR schedule, which means you don‚Äôt need to know the full number of training steps beforehand. It has been shown empirically to work on a wide variety of problems including language models.

[### SWE-agent (3 minute read)](https://swe-agent.com/?utm_source=tldrai)

SWE-agent turns LLMs (e.g. GPT-4) into software engineering agents that can fix bugs and issues in real GitHub repositories. SWE-agent sets the state-of-the-art performance on the full SWE-bench benchmark, resolving 12.29% of issues.

[### Representation Fine-Tuning (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft?utm_source=tldrai)
