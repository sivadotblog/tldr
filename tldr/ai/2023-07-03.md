### Research & Innovation

[### 1 million tokens in context helps DNA tasks (8 minute read)](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-29-hyena-dna?utm_source=tldrai)

State space models have made a splash recently. They arose as a potentially useful model alternative by sidestepping some challenging aspects of the Transformer while maintaining performance. In this work, the Hyena model is applied to DNA sequence modeling and improves in 23 tasks.

[### A More Efficient Way to Train a CLIP Model (6 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15658v1?utm_source=tldrai)

CLIPA-v2 improves the efficiency of image-text matching models like CLIP by using shorter sequences, achieving a zero-shot ImageNet accuracy of 81.1% for just $10,000.

[### Multiview Diffusion (6 minute read)](https://mvdiffusion.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

This work allows you to take a single image and a pre-trained generative model to produce a panorama or multiple views of the image.

GPT-Migrate enables you to easily migrate your codebase from one framework or language to another.

[### A New Method for Better Medical Imaging with Limited Data (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/openmedlab/mis-fm?utm_source=tldrai)

This study introduces 'Volume Fusion' (VF), a new way to train 3D medical imaging models without needing large amounts of pre-labelled data. The research showed that VF, combined with a new network structure, improved the accuracy of medical image interpretation for different body parts.

[### Filtered Guided Diffusion: Efficient Image-to-Image Translation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/jaclyngu/filteredguideddiffusion?utm_source=tldrai)

This research presents a method called Filtered Guided Diffusion (FGD) that enhances Image-to-Image (I2I) translation without requiring extra training or changes to the underlying model. FGD adjusts the diffusion process based on previous steps and offers significant improvements in structural guidance and performance.

While we are all waiting for our 22k H100s to be delivered, we should probably practice training large models. Sasha Rush has another set of puzzles, but instead of GPUs or tensor shapes, he walks us through model parallelism, gradient accumulation, and more!

[### The Rise Of The AI Engineer (6 minute read)](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer?utm_source=tldrai)

The article discusses the rise of AI engineering as a specialized field and the skills required to thrive in this domain, highlighting the need for a strong understanding of machine learning algorithms, data manipulation, and programming languages, as well as the ability to bridge the gap between research and implementation in order to create practical AI solutions.

[### Which models comply with EU privacy? (13 minute read)](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/06/15/eu-ai-act.html?utm_source=tldrai)

It is well known that Europe has stronger privacy requirements for many digital applications. This includes AI and language models. Unfortunately, many of the model providers today don't fully comply with these privacy requirements. This post explores where they fall short and which ones are the closest to full compliance.
