[### How AI21, Copy.ai, and Jasper got Enterprise Ready (Sponsor)](https://workos.com/blog/how-ai-companies-can-quickly-become-enterprise-ready?utm_source=tldr-ai&amp;utm_campaign=20240416)

Most of the successful applications of genAI are currently in B2B. But to win enterprise-sized contracts, AI startups need to meet stringent security and compliance requirements.

Against this backdrop, [WorkOS has seen tremendous growth](https://workos.com/blog/how-ai-companies-can-quickly-become-enterprise-ready?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_campaign=20240416) with AI companies using its enterprise-readiness platform. This includes heavy-hitters like Jasper, Copy.ai, AI21 Labs, and Perplexity.ai.

Check out the [WorkOS blog](https://workos.com/blog/how-ai-companies-can-quickly-become-enterprise-ready?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_campaign=20240416) for lessons learned working with these and other AI startups, including [key enterprise-readiness priorities for AI companies.](https://workos.com/blog/how-ai-companies-can-quickly-become-enterprise-ready?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_campaign=20240416) For more details about [Copy.ai's implementation](https://workos.com/customers/copy-ai?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_campaign=20240416) of SSO, SCIM, and user management, [check out the case study](https://workos.com/customers/copy-ai?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_campaign=20240416).

### Miscellaneous

[### The Agony and Ecstasy of Reviewing Humane's Ai Pin (23 minute read)](https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-ai-pin-in-depth-review?utm_source=tldrai)

Humane's Ai Pin, an AI-powered wearable, has many technical issues, from music streaming to AI assistant malfunctions. Despite its ambition to create an ambient computing experience, the first-generation device suffers from performance lags and a lack of essential features, though future software updates are promised. The Ai Pin is designed with attention to detail but struggles to replace traditional smartphones, positioning itself as a companion device for a more present and less screen-focused lifestyle.

[### You can't build a moat with AI (4 minute read)](https://generatingconversation.substack.com/p/you-cant-build-a-moat-with-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

AI differentiation is challenging, but the key lies not in AI models like LLMs, which are becoming commoditized, but in the unique data fed into these models. Effective data engineering is crucial as it directly impacts AI performance, with applications requiring integration of customer-specific data to provide accurate responses. Thus, creating a competitive edge in AI applications hinges on innovative data use rather than the AI technology itself.
