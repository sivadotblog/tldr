In a new AWS case study, [BlueOceanAI](https://blueocean.ai?utm_source=TLDR&utm_medium=enews&utm_campaign=q2q32025&utm_content=AI080425) shows how it's doing what dashboards and legacy analytics never could, turning billions of marketing signals into real-time strategy.

Built on Amazon Bedrock and powered by Claude 3, their Spark‚Ñ¢ platform helps companies like AWS, SAP, and Intel move from ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù to ‚ÄúWhat should we do next?‚Äù, fast.

* 97% faster execution
* 96% lower analytics costs
* 4x faster marketing payback

It's a [multi-agentic framework](https://www.blueocean.ai/?utm_source=TLDR&utm_medium=enews&utm_campaign=q2q32025&utm_content=AI080425) trained on proprietary brand data, generating competitive insights, content plans, and messaging strategy on demand.

### Headlines & Launches

[### Google releases Gemini 2.5 Deep Think for AI Ultra subscribers (1 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/google-releases-gemini-2-5-deep-think-for-ai-ultra-subscribers/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google's most powerful AI model generates multiple solution approaches simultaneously before selecting the best answer. A specialized version that can work for hours on complex problems recently achieved IMO gold medal status and is being shared with select mathematicians.

[### Anthropic cuts off OpenAI's access to its Claude models (1 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/02/anthropic-cuts-off-openais-access-to-its-claude-models/?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic revoked OpenAI's access after discovering the company was using Claude for internal benchmarking and coding assistance ahead of GPT-5's launch, violating terms that forbid using its AI to create and improve competitor models. OpenAI will retain access for safety evaluations and research collaboration on harmful capabilities testing.

[### OpenAI raises $8.3 billion as paid ChatGPT business users reach 5 million (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/openai-raise-chatgpt-users.html?utm_source=tldrai)

The round was part of the broader $40 billion fundraise and completed ahead of schedule, driven by OpenAI's annual recurring revenue jumping from $10 billion to $13 billion since June and projected to hit $20 billion by year-end. Dragoneer led with a $2.8 billion investment, 10% of its entire fund.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Tokens are getting more expensive (11 minute read)](https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed?utm_source=tldrai)

Models will always be cheaper next year, but users will expect more of them. The goalpost is always moving ahead. Even Anthropic, which has the most vertically integrated application layer on the planet, can't make a flat subscription with unlimited usage work. Companies without a plan are headed to the graveyard fast, as there are no investors writing checks for negative margin businesses. There's no figuring it out later when your AWS bill is larger than your revenue.

[### Andrew Ng on China's AI Momentum (9 minute read)](https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1950941108000964654?utm_source=tldrai)

In a detailed thread, Andrew Ng argued that China's open-model ecosystem, rapid semiconductor advances, and aggressive business dynamics give it a credible path to surpass the U.S. in AI.

[### Will data centers crash the economy? (11 minute read)](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/will-data-centers-crash-the-economy?utm_source=tldrai)

Big Tech's $102.5 billion quarterly AI spending now exceeds dot-com era investment as a share of GDP, but the real risk lies in financing through "private credit" funds that operate outside traditional banking oversight. Banks have increased their exposure to these shadow lenders 14x since 2013, creating conditions where a synchronized AI market downturn could trigger defaults on data centers, cascading through private credit funds to their bank and insurance company lenders.

[### Seed-Prover: Deep and Broad Reasoning for Automated Theorem Proving (18 minute read)](https://www.alphaxiv.org/abs/2507.23726?utm_source=tldrai)

ByteDance's Seed-Prover proved 5 of 6 problems at IMO 2025, the third AI system to do so, and the first Chinese model, in recent weeks. The system combines "lemma-style" whole-proof reasoning that breaks problems into modular components with three-tiered inference strategies from quick refinements to days-long reasoning that accumulates thousands of mathematical facts.

[### Persona vectors: Monitoring and controlling character traits in language models (5 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/persona-vectors?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers extracted "persona vectors" by comparing neural network activity when models exhibit specific traits versus when they don't, revealing that personality changes follow predictable mathematical patterns. This discovery enables a counterintuitive "vaccination" approach that purposefully steers models toward undesirable traits during training to compensate for their tendency to ‚Äúoverfit‚Äù to negative traits.

[### Does the Bitter Lesson Have Limits? (12 minute read)](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/08/01/does-the-bitter-lesson-have-limits.html?utm_source=tldrai)

General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective by a large margin. The eventual success of approaches based on scaling computation is often tinged with bitterness because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach. Developers need to be aware that their work might be overtaken by compute, but this shouldn't stop them from applying custom, human-crafted logic to get the job done.

[### AI's Overlooked $97 Billion Contribution to the Economy (4 minute read)](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/i4k0ce)

The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter. Americans enjoyed roughly $97 billion in consumer surplus (the difference between the maximum a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and its actual price) from generative AI tools in 2024. Around 40% of US adults are regular users of generative AI. As more digital goods become available for free, measuring benefits as well as costs will become increasingly important.
