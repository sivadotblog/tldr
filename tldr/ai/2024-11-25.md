[### Will Sam Altman always win the OpenAI board fight in an AI agent simulation? (13 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/games/can-sam-altman-win-the-openai-board-fight-in-an-ai-agent-simulation/?utm_source=tldrai)

Fable, a game and AI simulation company, built a simulation to explore the OpenAI board dispute involving Sam Altman using an AI decision-making framework called SIM-1. The simulation, which leveraged multi-agent competition and GPT4o, highlighted the unlikelihood of Altman's return as CEO in only 4 out of 20 scenarios. The research underscores AI's potential in simulating complex decision-making environments.
