[### This painting sold for a 5,798x price appreciation ‚Äì now you can access the market (Sponsor)](https://www.masterworks.com?utm_source=tldrai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=11-16-23&amp;utm_term=TLDR+AI+subscribers+&amp;utm_content=landing_exp)

When a New York City developer purchased an untitled painting for $19,000 in 1983, he wasn‚Äôt expecting a 5,798x return on his investment. But that's exactly what happened when he sold the Basquiat work for a stunning $110,000,000 in 2017.

Now, everyday investors are unlocking access to the very same market thanks to the blue-chip art investing platform, [Masterworks](https://www.masterworks.com?utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=11-16-23&utm_term=TLDR+AI+subscribers+&utm_content=landing_exp). When Masterworks sells a painting ‚Äì like the 16 it's already sold ‚Äì investors reap their portion of the profits.

DeepMind has been working on weather forecasting for a few years now. Its most recent model, built on graph neural networks, is extremely accurate for 10-day forecasts. DeepMind released code and weights so you can run it locally (if you have satellite data).

[### Video Frame Interpolation with Distance Indexing (4 minute read)](https://zzh-tech.github.io/InterpAny-Clearer/?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces a new method called "distance indexing" to improve video frame interpolation (VFI), which traditionally struggles with predicting precise object movements. This approach clarifies learning objectives and reduces blurriness by giving models explicit information about the distance an object travels between frames.
