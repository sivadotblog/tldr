RAG sounds simple in theory: retrieve relevant documents, feed them to an LLM, get grounded answers. In practice, there are [dozens of decisions](https://www.algolia.com/resources/asset/what-to-know-when-implementing-rag-with-your-search-solution?utm_campaign=tldr_global_b2x_ecomm_ecomm_tof_reach&utm_medium=display&utm_source=tldr&utm_content=tldr_global_b2x_ecomm&utm_term=ebo-implementing-rag-with-your-search-solution&utm_camp_parent=b2x_ecomm&utm_2nd_camp=ecomm_tof&utm_region=global&utm_goal=reach&utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&utm_model=cpm&utm_marketing_tactic=reach) that determine whether your system actually works.

[Algolia's white paper](https://www.algolia.com/resources/asset/what-to-know-when-implementing-rag-with-your-search-solution?utm_campaign=tldr_global_b2x_ecomm_ecomm_tof_reach&utm_medium=display&utm_source=tldr&utm_content=tldr_global_b2x_ecomm&utm_term=ebo-implementing-rag-with-your-search-solution&utm_camp_parent=b2x_ecomm&utm_2nd_camp=ecomm_tof&utm_region=global&utm_goal=reach&utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&utm_model=cpm&utm_marketing_tactic=reach) covers the full pipeline, including:

* Chunking: Why 200-500 word blocks with 10-20% overlap tend to work best for most use cases
* Embeddings: Batch vs. streaming updates, and when to re-embed your entire corpus
* Vector stores: HNSW vs. IVF+PQ indexing, sharding strategies, and how to keep retrieval under 50ms
* Prompt assembly: Structuring system messages, context blocks, and token budgets for reliable outputs

The guide includes working code examples using FAISS, LangChain, and Algolia's search client.

[### State of AI (90 minute read)](https://openrouter.ai/state-of-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

This year was a turning point in the real-world use of large language models. The field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference. The shift up folded so fast that our understanding of how these models have been used in practice has lagged behind. This study leverages the OpenRouter platform to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world AI interactions to see how the technology is being used in the real world. The way developers and end-users have been engaging with AI is complex and multifaceted. The study shows how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment.

[### We Got Claude to Fine-Tune an Open Source LLM (15 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-skills-training?utm_source=tldrai)

Hugging Face Skills gives Claude the ability to fine-tune language models. It can submit jobs to cloud GPUs, monitor progress, and push finished models to the Hugging Face Hub. This tutorial teaches readers how it works and how to use it. The tool allows users to train models from 0.5B to 70B parameters, convert them to GGUF for local deployment, and run multi-stage pipelines that combine different techniques.

[### Architecting efficient context-aware multi-agent framework for production (17 minute read)](https://developers.googleblog.com/architecting-efficient-context-aware-multi-agent-framework-for-production/?utm_source=tldrai)

The landscape of AI agent development is shifting fast. Organizations are now deploying sophisticated, autonomous agents to handle long-horizon tasks. However, this ambition is being bottlenecked by context. The context stack in Google Agent Development Kit was developed to support context engineering. The open-source, multi-agent-native framework is built to make active context engineering achievable in real systems.

[### Context Engineering for AI Agents (7 minute read)](https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering-part-2?utm_source=tldrai)

The field of context engineering is moving fast. However, the biggest performance gains nowadays come from removing complexity. As models get stronger, we should be getting out of the model's way. Context engineering is about minding the minimal effective context required for the next step, not about adding more context.

[### Power Overwhelming (17 minute read)](https://eastwind.substack.com/p/power-overwhelming?utm_source=tldrai)

AI capex is driving US GDP growth, yet a $1.5 trillion AI revenue shortfall looms compared to invested capital. OpenAI's infrastructure spend and emerging AI application revenues like ChatGPT's $20B by 2025 reveal a disconnect between projected and necessary earnings to justify current investments. The uncertain AI cloud business model, characterized by rapid hardware obsolescence, suggests heavy reliance on the Magnificent Seven's internal workloads to prevent an impending AI bubble and excessive market overbuild.
