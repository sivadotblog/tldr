### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI‚Äôs moat is stronger than you think (5 minute read)](https://www.airplane.dev/blog/openais-moat-is-stronger-than-you-think?utm_source=tldrai)

Despite a recent internal Google memo suggesting neither Google nor OpenAI will be able to build a sustainable business model around large AI models, there's an argument to the contrary. Quality AI models like GPT-4, while seemingly easy to create, are complex and difficult to build, and OpenAI's unique approach, including reinforcement learning from human feedback and data filtering, offers a significant advantage. Additionally, OpenAI's 'last-mile' delivery through ChatGPT and the OpenAI API, along with its strong brand, make the company's offerings tough to beat. These factors, together with OpenAI's quick achievement of product-market fit in both B2B and B2C sectors, suggest the company's position in the AI market is more defensible than the memo implies.

[### Together compute $20m seed round (2 minute read)](https://www.together.xyz/blog/seed-funding?utm_source=tldrai)

Together compute is, among other things, building a cloud platform for efficient machine learning. With strong academic connections, and highly talented technologists, they have a good shot of building really useful tools for the ecosystem. One of their notable works to date is the release of the red pajama data set, which is an open replication of the closed data set used to train Llama.

### Research & Innovation

[### Steering language models with activations (32 minute read)](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5spBue2z2tw4JuDCx/steering-gpt-2-xl-by-adding-an-activation-vector?utm_source=tldrai)

One of the goals of AI safety is called scalable oversight, where we hope to discover ways to steer language model generations without expensive human intervention. All the ideas in this paper aren't new, harkening back to soft prompts, it is an interesting extension. They find that by adding activation vectors for simple ideas, they can steer the generation towards those ideas. For example making text happier or more prone to conspiracy theory generation.

[### Megabyte - million byte sequences (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07185?utm_source=tldrai)

Transformers are not actually end to end. There is a separate training process for the tokenizer which is strange and often leads to odd performance in general. However, if we try to naively train on bytes we quickly run out of context length given the increased length of sequences. Additionally for truly multimodal problems training directly on bytes removes complex patching and tokenization schemes. This work allows models to train directly on bytes with sequence lengths up to a million bytes. Maybe this will even help nucleus sampling for rare words too!

[### Video Question Answering (45 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06988?utm_source=tldrai)

Visual question answering has seen massive adoption over the past several months, and rapid progress. Largely enabled by pre-trained models such as Blip and clip. Applying these models to video is challenging due to the dramatically increased computational requirements. This work introduces a cascade of different models that dramatically improves the robustness of these systems by operating at different timescales. They use Blip2 and find strong performance.

### Engineering & Resources

[### EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/Cream/tree/main/EfficientViT?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have created a new type of high-speed vision transformer called EfficientViT, which combines fast processing with improved accuracy. By redesigning certain parts of the transformer model, they were able to significantly reduce the computational costs associated with reshaping data and performing element-wise functions. The experiments showed that EfficientViT outperformed other efficient models, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining impressive processing speeds, even surpassing MobileNetV3.

[### Enhancing 3D Scene Reconstruction and Realism from Laser Data (5 minute read)](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/nfl/?utm_source=tldrai)

NFL is a new method that takes LiDAR data (a way of measuring distances using lasers) and creates realistic 3D scenes from new viewpoints. This technique works better than others and can help improve tasks like mapping and understanding the environment around us.

[### Microsoft Guidance (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/guidance/?utm_source=tldrai)

Programs are how we talk to computers, prompts are how we talk to AI, and AI is now talking to computers. This means that we need a better way to talk with AI. Guidance is essentially a prompting language and toolkit developed by Microsoft that allows you to set guidelines and instructions in a way that encourages reproducible and robust prompts.

[### Unveiling ImageBind (7 minute read)](https://medium.com/@ignacio.de.gregorio.noblejas/imagebind-c63e4967d67c?utm_source=tldrai)

This Medium post provides an in-depth analysis of Meta's AI model, ImageBind. ImageBind, a multi-modal AI model, can generate images from a text description and vice versa. It is trained on a diverse range of internet text and images. While ImageBind's accuracy and versatility are praised, the post also acknowledges that the model can occasionally produce irrelevant or inaccurate results.

[### Google Plans To Fight Back Against DeepFakes (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/as-ai-generated-fakes-proliferate-google-plans-to-fight-back/?utm_source=tldrai)

Arstechnica reports that Google is preparing to combat the increasing prevalence of AI-generated fakes. As deep fakes and other forms of manipulated content become more sophisticated, the tech giant is developing new tools to identify and flag this content. It plans to implement these measures across its various platforms to ensure the authenticity of content and protect users from misinformation. Google's approach will involve both technology, such as AI algorithms, and user education.

[### Uncensored Models (10 minute read)](https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models?utm_source=tldrai)

Eric Hartford's blog post explores the implications of uncensored AI models, suggesting that AI censorship might be leading us down a risky path. He argues for the development of systems to better manage the outputs rather than suppressing them. He mentions that more research and dialogue are needed around the ethics of AI use, and proposes the idea of a multi-stakeholder governance model for AI systems.
