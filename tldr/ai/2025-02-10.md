### Research & Innovation

[### Analyze Feature Flow to Enhance Interpretation and Steering in Language Models (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03032?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces a novel approach to tracking how features discovered by sparse autoencoders evolve across consecutive layers of large language models using a data-free cosine similarity technique that maps feature persistence, transformation, and emergence. The paper demonstrates how the resulting cross-layer feature maps enable direct behavioral control of the models through feature manipulation while providing mechanistic insights into model computations through granular flow graphs.

[### Federated Learning to Handle Noisy Data (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04301v1?utm_source=tldrai)

FedELC is a two-stage framework designed to enhance federated learning by addressing the issue of label noise in client datasets.

[### Smarter Search for Language Agents (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02584v1?utm_source=tldrai)

QLASS introduces a Q-guided stepwise search method for language agents that improves decision-making by providing intermediate rewards. This approach enhances inference efficiency and reduces reliance on annotated data.
