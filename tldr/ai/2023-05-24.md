### Headlines & Launches

[### Anthropic‚Äôs $450M Series C (2 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropic-series-c?utm_source=tldrai)

In what feels like the 450 millionth round of funding, Anthropic closes a similarly sized check. The main use for this funding will be to bring their products to market. Having gone through the same safety to product transition as OpenAI, we'll now see if they can continue to stick to their original mission.

[### White House Takes New Steps To Study AI Risks (2 minute read)](https://archive.ph/iYUDH?utm_source=tldrai)

The White House said on Tuesday that it would ask workers how their employers use artificial intelligence to monitor them, as it allocates federal investments in the technology, which is expected to change the nature of work.

[### Bing Chat comes to Windows (4 minute read)](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/?utm_source=tldrai)

Plugins allow AI systems to use tools and interact with digital systems. This ability is now coming to Windows with first and third party copilot style plugins. There has yet to be a successful desktop native copilot, but with the speed of execution we'll get to see this first push to market.

### Research & Innovation

[### Long awaited RWKV paper (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048?utm_source=tldrai)

Transformers displaced recurrent neural networks as the primary tool for most text based tasks. However, these Transformers are expensive and limited in context due to the architecture. RWKV is an attention variant (vaguely reminiscent of linear attention) that claims to have the best of both Transformers and recurrent models. The Discord is quite active, but there hasn't been a formal write up of this hyped model. This paper is the first to explain the model in depth.

[### Are Safetensors really safe? (8 minute read)](https://blog.eleuther.ai/safetensors-security-audit/?utm_source=tldrai)

Safetensors is a library that avoids many of the pitfalls of loading arbitrary binary files (pkl) from the internet. Specifically, loading a pretrained model can give attackers access to run arbitrary code. Thankfully, Safetensors alleviates this issue and allows secure sharing of tensor style artifacts with unknown actors.

[### VideoLLM: A Tool for Video Analysis using LLMs (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/cg1177/VideoLLM?utm_source=tldrai)

Leveraging the power of language processing models, the newly proposed VideoLLM system converts all video inputs into a type of language that can be analyzed more efficiently. By successfully testing on multiple datasets, VideoLLM proves that it can handle various tasks, suggesting that language model's reasoning abilities can be effectively used for understanding and analyzing video content.

[### How Rogue AIs May Arise (9 minute read)](https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/05/22/how-rogue-ais-may-arise/?utm_source=tldrai)

This article discusses how rogue AIs can arise. The author argues that the fastest route to a rogue AI system is if a human with the appropriate technical skills and means intentionally builds it with the objective of destroying humanity or a part of it set explicitly as a goal. Still, a broader and less understood set of circumstances could give rise to potentially rogue AIs, even if the humans making it did not intend to design a rogue AI.
