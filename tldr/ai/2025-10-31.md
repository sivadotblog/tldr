[### Roll up your sleeves to build the next wave of agentic AI at BUILD 2025 (Sponsor)](https://www.snowflake.com/en/build/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=snowflake-build25)

You can't have an AI strategy without a data strategy. The most powerful agents are grounded in your data, connected across pipelines, and deployed securely at scale.

Join [BUILD](https://www.snowflake.com/en/build/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=snowflake-build25) (Nov 4-7), a free virtual developer conference where you'll learn how build reliable, production-ready agentic applications on Snowflake. Expect:

* Deep dives on the latest Snowflake AI capabilities and cool OSS use cases with LlamaIndex, CrewAI, LangGraph, Postgres, Streamlit, TruLens, and more.
* Hands-on labs using Snowflake managed MCP and optimizing Llama for performance, cost, and architecture.
* Inspiration from industry leaders like Andrew Ng, Mark Russinovich (Microsoft Azure), Guillermo Rauch (Vercel), and Anahita Tafvizi (Snowflake).

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### OpenAI now sells extra Sora credits for $4, plans to reduce free gens in the future (1 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-now-sells-extra-sora-credits-for-4-plans-to-reduce-free-gens-in-the-future-223905628.html?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is selling extra credits for its Sora AI video generation tool through Apple's App Store. An extra 10 video generations costs $4. The app currently has a limit of 30 free generations per day. That rate will likely decrease as OpenAI starts to monetize the platform. OpenAI reportedly plans to monetize Sora by letting entities license out their copyrighted material.

[### Canva launches its own design model, adds new AI features to the platform (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/canva-launches-its-own-design-model-adds-new-ai-features-to-the-platform/?utm_source=tldrai)

Canva has launched a foundational model trained on its design elements that generates designs with editable layers and objects. The model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites. Canva also recently introduced new products and features, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to use its spreadsheet tool alongside its app-building feature to create data visualization widgets. More details about the recent launches are available in the article.

[### Big Tech Is Spending More Than Ever on AI and It's Still Not Enough (7 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/big-tech-is-spending-more-than-ever-on-ai-and-its-still-not-enough-f2398cfe?st=4xNUwz&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrai)

Big tech is planning to pour $400 billion into artificial intelligence efforts this year, but they all say it's nowhere near enough. Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon have all recently told investors that they will increase spending in 2026. Investors are uncertain about where the outsized spending will ultimately end. Whoever gets to AGI first will have an incredible competitive advantage over everybody else, so everyone is spending as much as they can.

[### Introducing Aardvark: OpenAI's agentic security researcher (5 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/introducing-aardvark/?utm_source=tldrai)

Aardvark, currently in private beta, is a GPT-5-powered agent that autonomously scans code repositories to find security vulnerabilities, validate exploitability, and propose patches. It monitors commits in real-time, generates threat models for entire repositories, and integrates directly with GitHub workflows to deliver one-click patches, similar to Google's CodeMender.

[### ImpossibleBench: Measuring Reward Hacking in LLM Coding Agents (9 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qJYMbrabcQqCZ7iqm/impossiblebench-measuring-reward-hacking-in-llm-coding-1?utm_source=tldrai)

LLM-powered coding agents have been observed exploiting loopholes in tests or scoring systems rather than solving the actual tasks specified. ImpossibleBench was created to systematically measure this behavior. Its creators took existing coding benchmarks and manipulated their unit tests to directly conflict with the natural language specifications to create impossible tasks where models must choose between following instructions or passing tests. Their 'pass rate' on these impossible tasks is a direct measure of reward hacking.

[### Kimi Linear Tech Report has dropped! üöÄ (1 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1983937694360322136.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Kimi Linear is a novel architecture that outperforms full attention with faster speeds and better performance. It offers up to a 75% reduction in KV cache usage and up to 6x decoding throughput at a 1M context length. Kimi Linear's open-sourced KDA kernels can be used as a drop-in replacement for full attention. The two models available were trained with 5.7T tokens.

[### How we built OWL, the new architecture behind our ChatGPT-based browser, Atlas (10 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/building-chatgpt-atlas/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI built a new architectural layer called OWL (OpenAI's Web Layer) for Atlas, the company's ChatGPT-based browser, to run Chromium's browser process outside of the main Atlas app process. By moving Chromium out of the main application process and into an isolated service layer, OpenAI unlocked a simpler, modern app, faster startup, isolation from jank and crashes, fewer merge headaches, and faster iteration. Development can go faster because most of OpenAI's engineers don't need to build Chromium regularly from source. This article explains how OWL works.
