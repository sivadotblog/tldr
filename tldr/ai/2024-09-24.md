### Research & Innovation

[### Teaching Diffusion Models to Count (25 minute read)](https://ozzafar.github.io/count_token/?utm_source=tldrai)

Getting a diffusion model to generate a certain number of an object is currently challenging. This work introduces a counting token that allows a model to successfully generate just a few or very many of a certain object. It isn't perfect as it builds on base stable diffusion, but it does much better than current alternatives.

[### Evaluating Long-Context Models (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12181v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a standardized evaluation protocol to compare methods for extending language models to handle long document contexts.

[### The Practitioner's Guide to the Maximal Update Parameterization (31 minute read)](https://blog.eleuther.ai/mutransfer/?utm_source=tldrai)

Maximal Update Parameterization, or muP, is a way to initialize your model so that you can transfer hyperparameters at any scale. This blog from Eleuther and Cerebras includes a minimal nanoGPT example and lots of instruction on how the process works.

[### Improving LLM Reasoning with MAgICoRe (20 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1?utm_source=tldrai)

MAgICoRe is a new strategy to improve reasoning in large language models by addressing challenges in refinement processes. It categorizes problems by difficulty, using simpler strategies for easy tasks and multi-agent iterative refinement for harder ones.

[### 3D Vision Transformer (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/feevos/tfcl?utm_source=tldrai)

This repository hosts an implementation of a 3D Vision Transformer designed for efficient field boundary delineation using time series satellite imagery. The model leverages spatio-temporal correlations to improve accuracy and robustness, particularly in challenging conditions such as partial cloud cover.

[### Speeding Up Long-Context Processing with CritiPrefill (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/66ring/critiprefill?utm_source=tldrai)

CritiPrefill is a method designed to accelerate the prefilling phase of long-context processing in large language models. By identifying and skipping non-essential computations, this approach speeds up the process by up to 3x on certain models.

[### Developing New Materials with AI (6 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2024/ai-model-can-reveal-crystalline-materials-structures-0919?utm_source=tldrai)

By analyzing X-ray crystallography data, the model could help researchers develop new materials for many applications, including batteries and magnets.

[### Document Similarity Search with ColiPali (17 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/fsommers/document-similarity-colpali?utm_source=tldrai)

A great blog post that explores the popular multimodal RAG system and how it can be used to solve practical problems.

[### When will AI outthink humans? (13 minute read)](https://davidvgilmore.com/writings/outthinking-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

This article explores when AI might surpass humans in cognitive volume, introducing "thought-hours" as a metric to quantify AI's cognitive output compared to human labor. Using assumptions around reading speeds and productivity, a thought-hour equates to 10,000 tokens. Current trends suggest AI could outthink humans within a decade, given the rapid growth in AI capabilities and cost efficiencies.
