### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### o3 over optimization is back (30 minute read)](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/openais-o3-over-optimization-is-back?utm_source=tldrai)

This post explores the challenge of the new crop of reasoning models and presents evidence to suggest that OpenAI is over-optimizing on certain objectives that make its models brittle and prone to hallucinations.

[### Verifiable rewards for writing (1 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1914334227534856420.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Writing quality reward models (WQRM) are a way to evaluate the quality of creative writing. They can be used to train creative writing models. WQRMs are a new development for RL-trained models with verifiable rewards. This thread shows a case where WQRM correlated strongly with overall writing quality.

[### AI assisted search-based research actually works now (6 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/?utm_source=tldrai)

Recent advancements in LLMs like OpenAI's o3 and o4-mini have made them effective for search-based tasks, avoiding past issues with hallucinations. Unlike earlier models, these LLMs integrate search results into their reasoning process, providing reliable real-time insights. This progression diminishes reliance on traditional search engines and suggests shifts in the Web's economic model.
