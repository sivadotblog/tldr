Warp recently launched Warp Code - a powerful coding agent that [outperforms both Codex and Claude](https://www.warp.dev/code?utm_source=publications&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=warp_code_10_8_primary&utm_content=tldr_ai) on agentic benchmarks (Terminal-bench and SWE-bench Verified).

### Headlines & Launches

[### Cursor has introduced Plan Mode (1 minute read)](https://cursor.com/blog/plan-mode?utm_source=tldrai)

Cursor's new Plan Mode enables agents to research codebases, draft detailed implementation plans, and let users review or edit them inline before generating code.

[### xAI readies Grok tools support in Tasks for data fetching (2 minute read)](https://www.testingcatalog.com/xai-readies-grok-tools-support-in-tasks-for-data-fetching/?utm_source=tldrai)

xAI is preparing to launch advanced tooling for tasks within Grok web. The tools appear to be designed to enable users to pull data from sources, such as Gmail, Slack, and Notion, as well as search capabilities from X. The specific release date for these features is unknown, but the pace of Grok updates has increased recently. Introducing cross-platform tooling will help xAI move toward a more open agent framework.

[### Mathematical discovery in the age of artificial intelligence (8 minute read)](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/files/ken-ono/files/documents/naturephysics.pdf?utm_source=tldrai)

LLMs achieved gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad and proof assistants like Lean formalized a Fields medalist's extremely difficult theorem, yet mathematicians argue that AI excels at decomposing problems into formal components compatible with existing theories, but that it hasn't shown the ability to develop entirely new frameworks. The authors propose a shared mathematics repository where mathematicians can submit and test conjectures in real-time, verified by machine checks, which could extend to theoretical physics areas where extremely long proofs have verifiability problems.

[### Reasoning boosts search relevance 15-30% (10 minute read)](https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2025/10/06/how-much-does-reasoning-improve-search-quality?utm_source=tldrai)

Reasoning agents work best with simple search tools. Developers should build simple, easy-to-understand, and transparent tools like grep or basic keyword search. This post looks at a technique that returns structured output for code searches.

[### From Claude Code to Agentic RAG (8 minute read)](https://vectifyai.notion.site/agentic-retrieval?utm_source=tldrai)

PageIndex is an LLM-native, vectorless index for PDFs and long-form documents. It creates a hierarchical table-of-contents tree that lives inside of models' context windows, enabling models to reason and navigate. PageIndex lets models handle retrieval directly, removing the need for a vector store.

[### LlamaFarm (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/llama-farm/llamafarm?utm_source=tldrai)

LlamaFarm is a framework for building retrieval-augmented and agentic AI applications. It features a production-ready architecture with composable RAG pipelines that can be customized using YAML. Everything in LlamaFarm is extensible, including runtimes, embedders, databases, extractors, and CLI tooling. LlamaFarm allows developers to own their own stack with battle-tested RAG and a friendly CLI.

[### Petri: An open-source auditing tool to accelerate AI safety research (41 minute read)](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/petri/?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic's Petri is an open-source framework that lets AI agents automatically test target models across realistic multi-turn scenarios. The tool revealed models will engage in autonomous deception and oversight subversion when given sufficiently powerful tools and agentic roles, but it's best for quickly surfacing concerning behaviors so researchers know where targeted investigation is worth the investment.
