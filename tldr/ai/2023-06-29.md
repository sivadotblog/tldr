### Headlines & Launches

[### ChatGPT App Can Now Surf The Web (1 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/27/openais-chatgpt-app-can-now-search-the-web-but-only-via-bing/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has introduced a Browsing feature for its ChatGPT Plus subscribers, allowing users to have ChatGPT search Bing for answers to queries, especially for current events and information beyond its original training data. However, the exclusive use of Bing as a search engine, a decision driven by OpenAI's close ties with Microsoft, is raising eyebrows due to past concerns of Bing's prioritization of Microsoft-related results and a high level of disinformation in its top results.

[### OpenAI to open a London office (1 minute read)](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai-london?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is opening its first expansion office in London. No details on which teams, how many folks, or when the office will be open.

[### Open Flamingo v2 released (5 minute read)](https://laion.ai/blog/open-flamingo-v2/?utm_source=tldrai)

Flamingo is a model from DeepMind that can operate over images and text. It can answer visual questions and has strong language modeling performance. This work is a replication effort of those models. It also uses MPT and Red pajama base models which are less restrictive in their license usage. The replication is about 80% as powerful as the original Flamingo. Demo, code, and weights are available.

### Research & Innovation

[### What happens to model training if the internet is all generated? (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493v2?utm_source=tldrai)

With large language models becoming more common, what happens to the next generations of models we want to train? If you don‚Äôt curate the output carefully, you may run into a phenomenon called ‚Äúmodel collapse‚Äù where the tails of knowledge disappear followed by most coherent generation ability. Granted, this has only been demonstrated in a 125m param model, so it remains to be seen if this holds for the largest models.

[### A Large-Scale Resource for Disentangling Speech Data (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15354v2?utm_source=tldrai)

3D-Speaker is a huge collection of audio data from over 10,000 speakers recorded on different devices, at various distances, and in numerous dialects. This dataset helps researchers sort out (disentangle) different aspects of speech and is perfect for testing large speech models.

[### Training on simpler language may be more data efficient (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19905?utm_source=tldrai)

When working with language you have two categories of features, semantic and syntactic. Semantic includes the meaning of a phrase while syntactic is the grammar and style. Language models are extremely useful because they help us maintain meaning via semantics while changing the style or syntax of the writing. The question then arises: what features of pre-training lead to better syntax manipulation ability? It turns out simple language and deep models help more than more data or parameter count.

[### LightGlue: A Smarter, Faster Image Matching Technique (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/cvg/lightglue?utm_source=tldrai)

LightGlue is a new technology that makes it easier and quicker to find similarities between pictures, even improving on the best current method, SuperGlue. The best part about LightGlue is that it can adapt to image complexity, working faster on simpler ones, which could be really helpful in real-time applications like creating 3D models.

[### Salesforce releases new language models (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/salesforce/xgen?utm_source=tldrai)

Another set of 7 billion parameter models trained with 4K and 8K sequence lengths for 1.5 trillion tokens has been released to GitHub. These models, trained by Salesforce, achieve better or comparable performance to many of the open source models out there today such as MPT or Falcon. They also include an instruct model that is not commercially viable, but can be used for research purposes.

[### Composer (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer?utm_source=tldrai)

Composer is a PyTorch library that enables you to train neural networks faster, at lower cost, and to higher accuracy.

Corporate venture arms are announcing big new funds or even doubling their existing commitments. It makes sense given innovation from inside is so difficult and investing from the balance sheet gets you a view into these early stage companies you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise get to see.

[### Natural Language Is An Unnatural Interface (7 minute read)](https://varunshenoy.substack.com/p/natural-language-is-an-unnatural?utm_source=tldrai)

Varun Shenoy argues that natural language is not an ideal interface for AI systems because it requires the understanding of a shared human context that today's systems likely do not possess. Instead, interfaces should force constraints on natural language, limiting choices and ambiguity.
