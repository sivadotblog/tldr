### Research & Innovation

[### RAG 2.0 (8 minute read)](https://contextual.ai/introducing-rag2/?utm_source=tldrai)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a way to inject knowledge into a potentially stale language model. Unfortunately, the current paradigm of ‚Äúfrozen RAG‚Äù, where only part of the pipeline is trained and the actual model itself isn‚Äôt updated, performs poorly outside of demos. This blog outlines the next generation of RAG where everything is tuned specifically for the task. An open model like Mistral 7B can outperform traditional GPT-4 RAG in this system.

AI advancement poses a significant threat to the adtech industry, with its ability to filter out ads, potentially reducing the $1 trillion in annual revenue that companies like Google, Meta, and TikTok currently enjoy. This series explores how AI disrupts the crucial ad inventory by appealing to consumers' desire for ad-free content and questions the stability of Big Tech's business models. The analysis delves into AI's effects on ad consumption, which has implications for major players like OpenAI, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and Alphabet.

[### OpenAI‚Äôs ‚ÄúOwn Goal‚Äù (4 minute read)](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/openais-own-goal?utm_source=tldrai)

Elon Musk's lawsuit highlighted OpenAI's departure from its original open-source ethos to a more closed, profit-driven model that contradicts its founding principles. An email between OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever and Musk from 2015 suggests that OpenAI knew early on that it would deviate from its stated mission. Criticism mounts as OpenAI faces accusations of failing to correct public misperceptions, enabling potentially harmful AI outputs and veering away from its nonprofit origins.
