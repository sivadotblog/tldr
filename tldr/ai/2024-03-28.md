[### Audio-Driven Animation (7 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17694v1?utm_source=tldrai)

AniPortrait is a framework designed to create lifelike animated portraits from a single reference image and audio input. By translating audio into 3D representations and then mapping these onto 2D facial landmarks, this method produces animations that excel in natural facial expressions, varied poses, and high visual quality.

[### Binary Search Vectors (12 minute read)](https://blog.pgvecto.rs/my-binary-vector-search-is-better-than-your-fp32-vectors?utm_source=tldrai)

Searching over embedding vectors is a key to RAG pipelines. If you replace the fp32 numbers with a single 0 or 1, then use a KNN clusterer and reranker, you can maintain performance while shrinking memory requirements 30x.
