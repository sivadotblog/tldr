[### Video scraping: extracting JSON data from a 35 second screen capture for less than 1/10th of a cent (6 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/17/video-scraping/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google Gemini's AI Studio can successfully extract numerical data from a video screen recording of emails. The process involves using the inexpensive Gemini 1.5 Flash model and incurs almost no cost. This novel "video scraping" approach offers a practical alternative to traditional data extraction methods.

[### Predicting Weight Loss with Machine Learning (3 minute read)](https://www.feelingbuggy.com/p/predicting-weight-loss-with-machine?utm_source=tldrai)

This author used a simple feedforward DNN model to track and predict weight loss on a ketogenic diet. The model captured the non-linear weight loss pattern, fit a function to the data, and visualized calorie metrics. The Harris-Benedict Equation was used to compare calorie needs to real weight loss for better insights.

[### The AI Investment Boom (11 minute read)](https://www.apricitas.io/p/the-ai-investment-boom?utm_source=tldrai)

The AI boom is driving significant US investment in data centers, computing infrastructure, and advanced hardware, with data center construction reaching a record-high $28.6 billion annually. This surge is fueled by the growing demand for powerful computing resources necessary for training and deploying advanced AI models. While revenue rebounds in the tech sector, job growth remains concentrated in semiconductor manufacturing and infrastructure, diverting focus from traditional programming roles.
