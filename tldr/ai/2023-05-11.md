### Headlines & Launches

[### Google Releases MusicLM (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/10/google-makes-its-text-to-music-ai-public/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google today released MusicLM, a new experimental AI tool that can turn text descriptions into music. Available in the AI Test Kitchen app on the web, Android or iOS, MusicLM lets users type in a prompt like ‚Äúsoulful jazz for a dinner party‚Äù or ‚Äúcreate an industrial techno sound that is hypnotic‚Äù and have the tool create several versions of the song.

[### Google's AI Chatbot Bard Gets Multilingual with New Upgrades (6 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23718066/google-bard-ai-features-waitlist-dark-mode-visual-search-io?utm_source=tldrai)

Google is boosting the abilities of its AI chatbot Bard with added features such as multi-language support, Google Docs and Gmail integration, and visual search, while also making it globally available. Bard, now upgraded to Google's new PaLM 2 language model, will offer improved responses, better coding assistance including debugging, and the ability to generate visuals using AI in the future, keeping it competitive with rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Bing chatbot.

[### HuggingFace Agents (11 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/transformers_agents?utm_source=tldrai)

Agents are language models that can use tools. These tools are digital like calculators or other AI models. HuggingFace has an interface that allows you to use agents easily and quickly. They provide a curated set of models that work well for many tasks. The recent release of Starcoder also improves the usability of agents pretty dramatically.

[### Building Affordable Businesses with Large Language Models (5 minute read)](https://info.deeplearning.ai/battlefield-chat-protecting-artists-styles-openai-retools-for-business-language-models-for-science-search?utm_source=tldrai)

This batch of deeplearning.ai newsletter examines how using large language models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5-turbo, can be a cost-effective solution for automating tasks or generating content. It highlights that LLMs can generate enough text to engage a user for an hour for as low as $0.08, making them significantly cheaper than human labor for many tasks, and that the cost-effectiveness improves further when the generated content is consumed by a large audience.

[### Exploring the Power and Potential of Data Augmentation with Diffusion Models (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10253?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper systematically evaluates methods for generating images from diffusion models and their benefits for data augmentation in downstream tasks. The study reveals that personalizing diffusion models towards target data is effective, but using the training data of the diffusion model alone through a simple nearest neighbor retrieval procedure results in stronger downstream performance, highlighting the potential and limitations of diffusion models in data augmentation.

[### Enhancing Language Models with Algorithms for Superior Performance (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05364?utm_source=tldrai)

Recent research shows that incorporating algorithms into large pre-trained language models (LLMs) can significantly improve their capabilities, without the need for fine-tuning. An example of evidence-supported question-answering demonstrates a 6.4% improvement over the standard baseline, suggesting the potential advantages of this innovative, cost-effective method.

Chain-Of-Thought-Hub benchmarks large language models' complex reasoning ability with chain-of-thought prompting.

[### LLM Chain (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/sobelio/llm-chain?utm_source=tldrai)

LLM Chain is a powerful rust crate for building chains in large language models allowing you to summarize text and complete complex tasks.

[### Pre-training without attention (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/jxiw/BiGS?utm_source=tldrai)

Attention is a way for a language model to perform computation over words. It is pretty expensive. What if we could use 1d convolution state space models for BERT training? It turns out to perform quite well, all the code, weights, etc is available here in Jax.
