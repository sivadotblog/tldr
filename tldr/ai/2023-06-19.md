Testing and developing applications requires access to production data. However, distributing this data across lower environments or granting broad user access carries substantial privacy risks.

In this webinar, [Gretel.ai](http://Gretel.ai) explores the [role of synthetic data](https://info.gretel.ai/en-us/webinar-leveraging-synthetic-data-for-test-data-management?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship&utm_campaign=tldr-20230619) in providing safe access to production-grade data for testing and development. Here‚Äôs [what you‚Äôll learn:](https://info.gretel.ai/en-us/webinar-leveraging-synthetic-data-for-test-data-management?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship&utm_campaign=tldr-20230619)

‚óæAnonymizing data to provide safe access in lower environments.

‚óæRealistic unit testing with synthetic data.

‚óæConditional generation for scenario-based feature testing.

‚óæBoosting small datasets for load and stress testing.

‚óæUsing data subsetting for shorter development cycles.

[### Meta Plans To Offer Free Commercial AI Models (2 minute read)](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/metas-plan-to-offer-free-commercial-ai-models-puts-pressure-on-google-and?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta's plan to offer free commercial AI models is a strategic move that could put pressure on its competitors, Google and OpenAI. Meta is hoping to commoditize AI by making it more accessible to developers, which could make it more difficult for Google and OpenAI to maintain their competitive advantage.

[### ByteDance ordered $1B of GPUs (5 minute read)](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chinas-bytedance-has-gobbled-up-dollar1-billion-of-nvidia-gpus-for-ai-this-year?utm_source=tldrai)

The Chinese behemoth has purchased around 100k GPUs from NVIDIA to use for different AI projects. These orders were placed before the regulatory blockage of GPU exports. Add one more to the list of companies bolstering their AI efforts with compute.

[### Permissively licensed Llama reproduction (3 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/openlm-research/open_llama_13b?utm_source=tldrai)

The original Llama model from Meta made a splash these past months. It is unfortunately unavailable for commercial use. This project attempts to use the RedPajama 1T dataset to reproduce the Llama models. They present evaluations which show the OpenLlama models to be similarly performant to their original counterparts, at least for the 3B, 7B, and 13B models.

[### Running an A100 for cheap (12 minute read)](https://l4rz.net/running-nvidia-sxm-gpus-in-consumer-pcs/?utm_source=tldrai)

Nvidia A100s are one of the most powerful GPUs on the market. They have been used to train some of the most popular models to date. They are data center GPUs, which typically means you cannot run them on your own hardware. This post explores how you can hack together your own A100 supercomputer that runs locally for just a few thousand dollars.

[### Text to speech gets an upgrade (14 minute read)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/voicebox-generative-ai-model-speech/?utm_source=tldrai)

Text to speech is the process of synthetically generating spoken words from some given text. It has always been a hard problem given the inauthentic nature of most generated speech. Meta, in their recent push for open source AI, has released Voicebox, the current state of the art model for generating speech. Examples are available in the article.

[### Just scale RL (30 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19452?utm_source=tldrai)

Reinforcement learning is notoriously tricky to scale. Meaning that when you increase the model size or increase the number of episodes, things start to break down. However, in other AI disciplines, scaling brings sufficient performance to make that challenge worth overcoming. In this study, by using a number of clever design tricks, the authors were able to scale their value-based RL system to achieve superhuman level performance on Atari 100K.

[### Seal: A Framework for Enhanced Visual Perception in Vehicles (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/youquanl/segment-any-point-cloud?utm_source=tldrai)

Seal is a new system that uses advanced visual recognition models to better interpret various types of vehicle sensor data, making it more efficient and adaptable. In tests, it improved interpretation of sensor data by nearly 37% compared to standard methods, showing significant potential for improving future car safety and navigation systems.

[### Can Large Language Models Be Effective Teachers? (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/swarnahub/explanationintervention?utm_source=tldrai)

This study investigates whether powerful LLMs can teach less advanced AI systems and improve their performance. The study proposes a 'student-teacher' relationship between two AIs and explores how, when, and what the 'teacher' AI should explain to the 'student' AI to boost its abilities, while staying within a communication budget. It shows that personalized teaching from the 'teacher' AI can lead to significant improvements in the 'student' AI's performance.

The article discusses several techniques to speed up the training and inference of large language models (LLMs) to use a large context window of up to 100K input tokens. These techniques include: ALiBi positional embedding, Sparse Attention, FlashAttention, Multi-Query attention, Conditional computation, and using 80GB A100 GPUs.

[### GPT-4 Can Use Tools Now. That‚Äôs A Big Deal (6 minute read)](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-4-can-use-tools-now-that-s-a-big-deal?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's GPT-4 language model can now use external tools to complete tasks, such as checking the weather, getting a stock price, or looking up data in a company's database. This is a significant improvement over previous versions of GPT, which were limited in what they could do by the information they were trained on.

[### Stanford's foundation model framework (7 minute read)](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/06/16/levanter-1_0-release.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Training foundation models from scratch is challenging. The language model group at Stanford has released a framework in Jax that makes this process easier. It provides a number of data and model parallelism strategies to simplify the programming process.
