[### The Challenges of Getting ML Models to Production (37 minute read)](https://www.heavybit.com/library/article/machine-learning-engineering-ai-incentives?utm_source=tldrai)

A deep dive interview from industry experts on the challenges and solutions of getting AI models into production and where MLOps differs from traditional engineering. They discuss why so few ML projects make it to production and how to focus as an organization to actually launch.

[### Effort (5 minute read)](https://bit.ly/3xEbKSm)

The Effort library allows for real-time adjustment of the number of calculations performed during inference of an LLM model, resulting in significant speed improvements while retaining most of the quality. Despite some implementation overhead, initial results suggest that the Effort library has the potential to significantly improve LLM inference speed while maintaining quality. The author encourages others to test the 0.0.1B version and provide feedback to further improve the library.
