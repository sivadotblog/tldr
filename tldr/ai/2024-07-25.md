[### AI is confusing ‚Äî here's your cheat sheet (10 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/24201441/ai-terminology-explained-humans?utm_source=tldrai)

This article clarifies key AI terms amidst growing confusion due to marketing jargon, highlighting concepts such as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Generative AI, and machine learning. It addresses AI challenges like bias and hallucinations and elaborates on how AI models are trained, referencing various models, algorithms, and architecture, including transformers and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The piece also mentions leading AI companies and their products, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, and hardware used for AI, like NVIDIA's H100 chip.

[### OpenAI's latest model will block the ‚Äòignore all previous instructions' loophole (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201414/openai-chatgpt-gpt-4o-prompt-injection-instruction-hierarchy?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has developed a new technique called "instruction hierarchy" for its GPT-4o Mini model to prevent users from tricking the AI with unauthorized prompts, giving precedence to the developer's original instructions. This safety method is a step toward building more autonomous digital agents, ensuring they can't be manipulated into performing unintended actions. The enhanced prioritization of system instructions over user prompts aims to address growing safety and trust concerns surrounding AI models.
