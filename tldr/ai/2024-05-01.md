What if you had the opportunity to invest in the biggest electronics products as they launched into big box retail?

Ring changed doorbells and Nest changed thermostats. Early investors in these smart-home companies earned massive returns, but the opportunity to invest was limited to a select, wealthy few.

Not anymore. [RYSE](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=aion,05-01-2024) has just launched in 100+ Best Buy stores, and you're in luck ‚Äî you can still invest at only $1.50/share before their name becomes known nationwide.

They have patented [the only mass market shade automation device](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=aion,05-01-2024), and their exclusive deal with Best Buy resembles that which led Ring and Nest to their billion-dollar buyouts.
