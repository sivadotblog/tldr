[### Expert Panel: Moving LLM Applications from Development to Production (Sponsor)](https://go.truera.com/webinar-llm-apps-from-dev-to-prod?utm_campaign=webinar-2023-10-26-llm-apps-from-dev-to-prod&amp;utm_source=tldrai&amp;utm_medium=media)

Featuring speakers from OpenAI, Pinecone, TruEra, and Menlo Ventures

There are many cool demos of LLM apps out there. Getting them into production is an entirely different beast ‚Äî which requires [scaling up model and vector DB usage while managing costs](https://go.truera.com/webinar-llm-apps-from-dev-to-prod?utm_campaign=webinar-2023-10-26-llm-apps-from-dev-to-prod&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=media), and guarding against common failure modes like hallucinations, irrelevance, and bias.

Join seasoned technical experts in this upcoming panel:

* Discover the [lessons learned from building and deploying LLM-powered applications](https://go.truera.com/webinar-llm-apps-from-dev-to-prod?utm_campaign=webinar-2023-10-26-llm-apps-from-dev-to-prod&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=media), such as OpenAI‚Äôs GPT series and vector databases such as Pinecone.
* Learn how to [apply best practices](https://go.truera.com/webinar-llm-apps-from-dev-to-prod?utm_campaign=webinar-2023-10-26-llm-apps-from-dev-to-prod&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=media) like evaluation, debugging, and observability to achieve quality goals for LLM apps.

### Research & Innovation

[### Paper for Mistral 7B model (10 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06825?utm_source=tldrai)

The Mistral 7B model was released via a tweet. It beats many models twice its size. This paper explores some of the technical contributions and details. No discussion of the pre-training dataset, but good insights into the architecture.

[### Improving Memory in Continual Text Classification (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06362v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study explores the challenges faced in "continual learning", where a model tries to keep learning new things without forgetting old ones, especially in categorizing texts. It introduces a new method called InfoCL, which uses special techniques to help the model remember better and reduce mistakes.

[### Making AI-Generated Sentences Sound Natural (11 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06363v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers found that the sequence in which ideas or 'concepts' are presented to models that generate sentences affects how good the sentences turn out to be. Among various programs tested, BART-large did the best job when given ideas in a certain order, but surprisingly, bigger isn't always better.

[### A Case For GPT-4‚Äôs Capacity To Reason (6 minute read)](https://lajili.com/posts/post-3/?utm_source=tldrai)

Although GPT-4 lacks consciousness and long-term memory, there is good evidence that it is able to reason and comprehend concepts.

[### Prosecutors don‚Äôt want Bankman-Fried‚Äôs lawyers mentioning his $500 million investment in AI startup Anthropic (3 minute read)](https://archive.ph/5eLJB?utm_source=tldrai)

Prosecutors want to prevent former FTX cofounder Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs attorneys from mentioning his $500M investment in AI startup Anthropic during trial, deeming it irrelevant. Meanwhile, Anthropic, seen as a competitor to OpenAI, is seeking funding that could propel its valuation to $20B-$30B, after recently securing a $1.25B commitment from Amazon.

[### Universal, interactive, real world simulator (6 minute read)](https://universal-simulator.github.io/unisim/?utm_source=tldrai)

What if your simulator was generative AI? It would work to zero shot transfer robotic policies! This work from DeepMind and colleagues tackles the challenge that RL usually can't generalize past the training environment. If we just make everything the training environment then there is no need for extrapolating.
