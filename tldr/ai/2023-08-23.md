[### Making Object Detection Better for Small Items (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09534v1?utm_source=tldrai)

While current methods are great at detecting objects, they often have problems spotting small items. CFINet is designed specifically for these small object challenges. It uses a step-by-step approach to first find good areas of interest and then focuses on mimicking features to better recognize the small items.

[### Open replication of state-of-the-art vision/language models (28 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/idefics?utm_source=tldrai)

HuggingFace has released IDEFICS, which is quite the acronym (Image-aware Decoder Enhanced √† la Flamingo with Interleaved Cross-attentionS). IDEFICS is essentially a replication of Flamingo, which is a text and image model that interleaves the two and allows for visual question answering and reasoning. It is built on Llama v1 and has 8B and 70B variants.

[### Improving 3D Scene Understanding (2 minute read)](https://aibluefisher.github.io/DReg-NeRF/?utm_source=tldrai)

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are a hot topic in computer vision, combining multiple NeRFs together is still a challenge. To tackle this, this team developed DReg-NeRF, a new method that pulls out features from NeRF. It uses advanced techniques to understand how different 3D scenes relate to each other without needing any human input or special markers.

[### AI startups: Sell work, not software (4 minute read)](https://www.sarahtavel.com/p/ai-startups-sell-work-not-software?utm_source=tldrai)

LLMs offer a paradigm shift for startups from selling software aimed at user productivity to selling the actual work product itself. Companies can capitalize on this by automating specialized tasks (like creating a demand package for law firms) rather than just improving productivity incrementally. This approach competes with outsourced solutions, potentially offering more consistency and value, while reallocating human capital to higher-value tasks.
