[### asyncmcp (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/bh-rat/asyncmcp?utm_source=tldrai)

asyncmcp is a regular MCP that works over queues. A lot of context is not always readily available, and it takes time for applications to process it. asyncmcp uses an async transport layer, so it doesn't have to immediately respond to any requests - it chooses to direct them to internal queues for processing and the client doesn't have to stick around for the response.

[### Batch Mode in the Gemini API: Process more for less (4 minute read)](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/scale-your-ai-workloads-batch-mode-gemini-api/?utm_source=tldrai)

The Gemini API now has an asynchronous endpoint designed for high-throughput, non-latency-critical workloads. The Gemini API Batch Mode allows users to submit large jobs, offload the scheduling and processing, and retrieve results within 24 hours, with a 50% discount compared to the synchronous APIs. It is the perfect tool for when users have data ready upfront and don't need an immediate response.

[### FlexOlmo: LLM Training Without Sharing Raw Data (5 minute read)](https://allenai.org/blog/flexolmo?utm_source=tldrai)

The first of its kind, this architecture allows data contributors to activate or deactivate their contributions in real-time without retraining the entire model, enabling instant modification. The system trains separate expert modules on private datasets using a frozen public model as an anchor point, then merges them via domain-informed routing without requiring joint training.

[### The Only SaaS Feature You Should Be Building (3 minute read)](https://www.henrypray.com/writings/the-only-saas-feature-you-should-be-building?utm_source=tldrai)

Before companies can get to a future where real work happens through AI agents that interact with both data and people, companies have to solve the action interface for human operators. The action interface matters because most operators aren't prompt engineers - their job is to keep the world moving. Operators need a clean interface that lets them react to and confirm actions and a way to proactively ask the system to take actions. This article discusses a new paradigm for building interfaces that creates a seamless experience for operators.
