### Research & Innovation

[### Removing Inappropriate Content from Diffusion Models (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12383v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Reliable and Efficient Concept Erasure (RECE) is a novel method that erases inappropriate content from diffusion models in just 3 seconds without needing extra fine-tuning.

[### Leapfrogging traditional vector-based RAG with language maps (12 minute read)](https://x.com/mutableai/status/1813815706783490055?utm_source=tldrai)

Retrieval is a huge part of building a chat application over data. However, systems are often sensitive to the format of things being retrieved. Building a language map (e.g., Wikipedia style entry) of the content, and using that for retrieval dramatically improves chat-based performance. Mutable AI does this for code base question answering.

[### Patch-Level Training Technique Enhances Efficiency of LLMs (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12665v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers propose patch-level training for large language models to improve training efficiency.
