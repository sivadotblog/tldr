[### Improving Visual Generation with a New Video Tokenization (2 minute read)](https://magvit.cs.cmu.edu/?utm_source=tldrai)

This study introduces MAGVIT-v2, a video tokenizer that efficiently translates image and video inputs into tokens for Large Language Models. With MAGVIT-v2, LLMs surpass the performance of diffusion models in visual generation tasks.

[### Speeding Up Diffusion Models for Text Generation (7 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05793?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers introduce a new technique for diffusion models used in text generation. By using a soft absorbing state, they improved how the model handled discrete text changes, resulting in faster learning and quicker sampling.

[### Testing LLMs in the Competitive World of Auctions (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/jiangjiechen/auction-arena?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have created AucArena, a simulation platform designed to test Large Language Models in auction settings, which are dynamic and require strategic thinking. Initial tests show that, with the right prompts, these models can perform impressively in auctions, showing skills like budgeting and long-term planning.

[### AI Hype Is Built On Flawed Test Scores (8 minute read)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/30/1078670/large-language-models-arent-people-lets-stop-testing-them-like-they-were/?utm_source=tldrai)

A growing number of researchers want to overhaul the way LLMs are assessed, calling for more rigorous and exhaustive evaluation, as they believe the practice of scoring machines on human tests is misguided.

[### 8 ways SaaS companies can use AI to get ahead (12 minute read)](https://canny.io/blog/how-saas-can-use-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

From task automation to writing code, AI is adding leverage to how we analyze customer data and build products. The key takeaway here is that AI is enabling people to do a lot more, and if you‚Äôre not using it, you‚Äôre likely going to get outpaced by your competition.

[### AI bias tests gloss over a crucial aspect of skin color (5 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23902728/ai-bias-skin-tone-hue-sony-research-artificial-intelligence-ethics?utm_source=tldrai)

Sony's AI research suggests a more "multidimensional" approach to measuring skin color, emphasizing not just lightness/darkness but also red and yellow hues. Current scales might overlook biases against certain ethnic groups. Sony recommends the CIELAB color standard, even as others tout the simplicity of systems like the Monk Skin Tone Scale. Google and Amazon are reviewing Sony's findings.

[### GitHub Copilot Loses an Average of $20 Per User Per Month (2 minute read)](https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/290661/report-github-copilot-loses-an-average-of-20-per-user-per-month?utm_source=tldrai)

GitHub Copilot costs users $10 per month, but it is costing Microsoft an average of $20 per user per month. Some users are costing the company as much as $80 per month. This is likely why Microsoft decided to charge a lot more for the AI capabilities in Microsoft 365 Copilot. The costs are also likely why the company is developing its own in-house AI chip sets for its data centers and pushing the adoption of Neural Processing Units across the industry.
