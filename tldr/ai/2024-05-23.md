OpenAI and News Corp (which includes WSJ, NYP, The Times, and other publishers) agreed to bring its news content to OpenAI's platform, which they claim will increase the usability and accuracy of generations.

[### Stanford HAI Releases Updated Foundation Model Transparency Index (7 minute read)](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2024/05/21/fmti-may-2024.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Stanford HAI released the latest version of its Foundation Model Transparency Index, which evaluates the transparency of 14 major AI developers, including OpenAI and Google. These companies disclosed new information previously unavailable to the public, marking a significant improvement and willingness to open up the discourse about their models. Despite this progress, the average transparency score was just 58 out of 100, highlighting significant gaps in areas like data access, model trustworthiness, and downstream impact.

[### Microsoft Releases Phi-Silica (1 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-introduces-phi-silica-a-3-3b-parameter-model-made-for-copilot-pc-npus/?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft has announced the general availability of its Phi-3 models and introduced Phi-3-Silica, a small language model optimized for Neural Processing Units in Copilot+ PCs. Phi-3-Silica, with 3.3 billion parameters, offers fast local inferencing with low power consumption, marking a significant step in integrating advanced AI directly into Windows devices to enhance productivity and accessibility. It will be available in June.

### Miscellaneous

[### Chaos and tension at OpenAI (2 minute read)](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/chaos-and-tension-at-openai?utm_source=tldrai)

Ilya Sutskever has departed from OpenAI amidst concerns over the company's commitment to AI safety, signaling a potentially worrying trend as three other key personnel have also recently resigned. These departures raise questions about the impact on the company's safety-focused mission and its nonprofit status as it pursues commercialization. These events may also reverberate through legal and regulatory landscapes, prompting scrutiny from stakeholders in Washington.

[### Tarsier (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/reworkd/tarsier?utm_source=tldrai)

Reworkd has released Tarsier, a new tool to enhance LLMs for web interaction tasks by visually tagging elements on webpages using brackets and IDs. Tarsier allows an LLM without vision to understand a webpage's structure via OCR-generated text representations outperforming vision-language models in benchmarks.

[### The Old-Fashioned Library at the Heart of the A.I. Boom (4 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/technology/openai-library-office.html?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's headquarters, a renovated mayonnaise factory with a library-themed design, is emblematic of the company's language-focused success with ChatGPT. The office contrastingly serves as a reminder of the ongoing legal debates over the use of copyrighted material in AI training. Despite these disputes, OpenAI staff view the library as a space for inspiration, reinforcing their belief in the synergy between human and AI-driven creativity.
