### Headlines & Launches

[### Llama 2 (6 minute read)](https://ai.meta.com/llama/?utm_source=tldrai)

The commercially licensed version of Meta's extremely popular Llama model is now available. It was trained on 2T tokens and they have models up to 70B parameters. The paper linked in the blog has rich details and impressive tidbits that the community has guessed at but never confirmed, primary of which is around the absolute foundational nature of training the reward model properly. It‚Äôs harder to get right than it seems.

[### 8K MPT models (4 minute read)](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/long-context-mpt-7b-8k?utm_source=tldrai)

Trained on an additional 500 billion tokens on H100s for 3 days, the 8K context length models from Mosaic perform well on a variety of tasks and can serve as strong base models for fine-tuning.

[### OpenAI Is Holding back GPT4 Image Features Due To Privacy Issue Fears (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/report-openai-holding-back-gpt-4-image-features-on-fears-of-privacy-issues/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has been testing its multimodal version of GPT-4 with image-recognition support prior to a planned wide release. However, public access is being curtailed due to concerns about its ability to potentially recognize specific individuals.

### Research & Innovation

[### RetentiveNet, the Transformer contender (27 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08621?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft Research‚Äôs UniLM group has released another potentially disruptive architecture called RetNet. It is a middle ground between recurrent models and transformers while maintaining benefits of each. The scale up and find 7B models (trained for 100B tokens) outperform transformers. Potentially the most interesting tidbit, aside from the robust theoretical comparison, is that it was trained on 512 AMD MI200 GPUs.

[### An Efficient Framework for Action Recognition (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08476v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper presents a new method, Skeleton Sequence Learning, which uses the fine-grained dependencies among human skeleton joints to learn and understand human action without needing extensive labeled data.

[### Text Generation with Complex Constraints (2 minute read)](https://collie-benchmark.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

The study introduces COLLIE, a new tool that enables text generation based on complex, grammar-based constraints at various levels (words, sentences, paragraphs, and passages), providing a bigger challenge than the simple constraints currently used in natural language processing.

### Engineering & Resources

[### AutoChain (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Forethought-Technologies/AutoChain?utm_source=tldrai)

AutoChain takes inspiration from LangChain and AutoGPT and aims to solve problems with both by providing a lightweight and extensible framework for developers to build their own agents using LLMs with custom tools.

[### Mimicking Human Behavior with Pretrained Models (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/windvchen/diff-harmonization?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper proposes a new method for image harmonization that, unlike previous methods, doesn't rely on a massive number of composite images, making it less expensive to train and more generalizable.

[### A Tool for Improved, Consistent Video Depth Estimation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/RaymondWang987/NVDS?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces a new method called Neural Video Depth Stabilizer that provides consistent and accurate depth estimations in videos. The team also presents the largest-ever dataset of natural-scene video depth, called Video Depth in the Wild.
