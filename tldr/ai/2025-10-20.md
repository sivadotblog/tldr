[### An Opinionated Guide to Using AI (7 minute read)](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/an-opinionated-guide-to-using-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

The biggest mistake people make with paid AI subscriptions is staying in auto mode, where the system picks weaker models instead of manually selecting agentic modes that are far more capable and less error-prone for real work. This guide covers practical choices like when free models suffice versus paying $20 monthly, why prompting techniques that worked on older models no longer matter, and why explicitly telling AI to act as a critic is necessary to avoid talking to a sophisticated yes-man.

[### We are in the "gentleman scientist" era of AI research (10 minute read)](https://www.seangoedecke.com/ai-and-informal-science/?utm_source=tldrai)

Discoveries were simple in the early days of science. Many were discovered in the course of pursuing a hobby. To win the 2026 Nobel Prize in physics, you have to be a physicist fully immersed in the world of physics. AI research is still very much in the 'early days of science' category. While many papers look complicated, AI research discoveries are often simpler than they look. Many things we learn about AI capabilities come from informal user experimentation.
