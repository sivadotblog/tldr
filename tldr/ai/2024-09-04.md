[### CEO of OpenAI Japan reveals plans for GPT Next (5 minute read)](https://www.itmedia.co.jp/aiplus/articles/2409/03/news165.html?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's GPT Next will be trained with approximately 100x the compute load of GPT-4. It will be released later this year. The true estimates suggest some of the compute load changes are also due to algorithmic improvements. The article is in Japanese.

[### Anthropic Quickstart Repo (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic has released a useful set of starter projects. It has partnered with former heads of AI from Brex, Uber, Facebook, and others to help write the first Quickstart, a scalable customer service agent powered by Claude.

[### AI Has Created a Battle Over Web Crawling (11 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/web-crawling?utm_source=tldrai)

A report by the Data Provenance Initiative warns that generative AI models may suffer as websites increasingly restrict crawler bots, blocking access to high-quality data. This trend, driven by fears of data misuse, could shift AI training reliance from well-maintained sources to lower-quality data. Companies may turn to synthetic data or direct licensing to maintain AI model efficacy amid growing data scarcity.
