### Headlines & Launches

[### Anthropic‚Äôs view on AI safety and progress (33 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/index/core-views-on-ai-safety?utm_source=tldrai)

Hot on the heels of OpenAI‚Äôs recent post on AGI - Anthropic‚Äôs post is a more measured take on the current state of research and how it fits into their organization's goals. In general, they are interested in safety as it relates to capabilities and policy. They structure their research into Capabilities, Aligning Capabilities, and Alignment science research. In all, their scalable approach to building robust systems seems quite effective.

[### Chat by Copy.ai (Product Launch)](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/chat-by-copy-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

Chat by Copy.ai is the smarter ChatGPT that helps you get more done. Scrape websites for public data, generate personalized copy, summarize YouTube videos into key bullet points, and so much more with the next generation of AI chat.

[### Introducing Kaggle Models (Product Launch)](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-feedback/391200?utm_source=tldrai)

We all know Kaggle for its AI and data science competitions. Now, they are launching Kaggle Models, a hub to discover and use pretrained models through deep integrations with the rest of Kaggle‚Äôs platform. Kaggle is collaborating with TensorFlow Hub (tfhub.dev) to make a curated set of nearly 2,000 public Google, DeepMind, and other models available natively on the platform.

### Research & Innovation

[### Magic Prompt (HuggingFace Space)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Stable-Diffusion?utm_source=tldrai)

Automated prompt engineering - enter a simple description and the Magic Prompt will give you several examples that look amazing when fed to Stable Diffusion.

[### Video-P2P: Video Editing with Cross-attention Control (3 minute read)](https://video-p2p.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

The project presents Video-P2P, a framework for real-world video editing that uses cross-attention control. It adapts an image generation diffusion model and proposes a Text-to-Set (T2S) model for accurate video inversion. The framework incorporates a decoupled-guidance strategy for detailed editing and enables text-driven editing applications. Video-P2P outperforms previous approaches and preserves original poses and scenes.

[### Panoptic Segmentation with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models (4 minute read)](https://jerryxu.net/ODISE/?utm_source=tldrai)

The paper introduces ODISE, which uses pre-trained text-image diffusion and discriminative models to perform open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. The proposed approach leverages the representation of both models to outperform the previous state-of-the-art in open-vocabulary panoptic and semantic segmentation tasks. With COCO training only, ODISE achieves 23.4 PQ and 30.0 mIoU on the ADE20K dataset, with 8.3 PQ and 7.9 mIoU improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.

### Engineering & Resources

[### 4 bit quantization for llama (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/qwopqwop200/GPTQ-for-LLaMa?utm_source=tldrai)

4 bit quantization of LLaMa using GPTQ - a state of the art zero-shot weight quantization. You can get an order of magnitude of savings in GPU memory usage with a slight drop in performance using these techniques which may allow some of the large models to run on consumer hardware. The quantization technique, however, requires a fairly significant amount of CPU memory to produce the reduced model weights.

[### New Accelerate release with a slew of new features (1 minute read)](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/releases/tag/v0.17.0?utm_source=tldrai)

You can now use Pytorch 2.0 with Accelerate. This is a nice benefit given the speed ups in the new Pytorch version. Additionally, Accelerate now has fp8 support and experimental TPU training support.

[### Visual ChatGPT (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrai)

This is an excellent example of chaining together multiple powerful models. This is also the first open and somewhat complex example of Tool use. There is a nice GIF of functionality in the README.

### Miscellaneous

[### ChatGPT API is so good and cheap, you don‚Äôt need anything else (7 minute read)](https://minimaxir.com/2023/03/new-chatgpt-overlord/?utm_source=tldrai)

The dramatic decrease in cost while maintaining quality makes it hard to justify other text generation systems. This may be a loss leader, or reaction to competition, but in any case the power of this model makes it somewhat of a no-brainer for most companies looking to add text generation to their product. It‚Äôs not clear how long this will be true, but for now it is an interesting state of things.

[### Using AI to turn the Web into a database (3 minute read)](https://theaimaze.com/p/using-ai-to-turn-the-web-into-a-database?utm_source=tldrai)

Advancements in AI are making previously impossible products a reality. Now is the perfect time to revisit some of the original ideas that failed. One of the most exciting ideas from the Semantic Web was the creation of ‚ÄúSemantic Web Agents‚Äù that would navigate the web and do tasks on your behalf. The Semantic Web will bring structure to the meaningful content of Web pages, creating an environment where software agents roaming from page to page can readily carry out sophisticated tasks for users.

[### Grammarly Is Adding AI Features (1 minute read)](https://9to5google.com/2023/03/09/grammarly-ai-generative/?utm_source=tldrai)

Grammar-checking tool Grammarly is adding in an AI tool that can write content in your personal writing style.

[### The Office lines dataset (HuggingFace Dataset)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jxm/the_office_lines?utm_source=tldrai)

50k+ lines with season, episode, scene, speaker, and text from the popular US tv show. Potentially a fun dataset to use for side projects.

[### Super simple ChatGPT wrapper (GitHub Repo)](https://gist.github.com/joeddav/a11e5cc0850f0e540324177a53b547ae?utm_source=tldrai)

A simple wrapper to deal with the slightly odd format of gpt-3.5-turbo. It sets the system‚Äôs role and unwraps the responses while maintaining some semblance of chat history.
