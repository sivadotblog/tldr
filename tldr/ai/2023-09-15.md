### Headlines & Launches

[### Microsoft Open Sources EvoDiff (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/microsoft-open-sources-evodiff-a-novel-protein-generating-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft has open-sourced EvoDiff, a novel AI model that the company claims can generate high-fidelity, diverse proteins given a protein sequence.

[### Patronus AI raises $3m seed to raise confidence in enterprise LLMs (5 minute read)](https://www.patronus.ai/blog/patronus-launch?utm_source=tldrai)

Led by Lightspeed, the team wants to build real world scoring to help understand how useful LLMs are for enterprises.

[### MLPerf Results Highlight Growing Importance of Generative AI and Storage (5 minute read)](https://mlcommons.org/en/news/mlperf-inference-storage-q323?utm_source=tldrai)

MLPerf has released results from two benchmark suites: MLPerf Inference v3.1, which showcases record participation and performance gains, and MLPerf Storage v0.5, which assesses storage system performance for ML training workloads. The Inference benchmark suite introduced a large language model and updated recommender tests, reflecting emerging AI trends.

### Research & Innovation

[### Align a language model without training (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07124?utm_source=tldrai)

Alignment helps make language models more helpful and harmless. It can sometimes hurt performance, but in general is a positive. Alignment is expensive and requires substantial alignment data. However, if you allow the model to rewind during generation after evaluating its own output, it can improve alignment performance on the frozen model by up to 81%.

[### Pushing mixture of experts to the limit with parameter efficiency (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05444?utm_source=tldrai)

Mixture of experts (MoEs) is a cool way to increase the capacity of a model without increasing per token runtime. However, they're still tricky to run quickly and fine-tune. Researchers find that if you modify dense model parameters efficiently fine tuning to work with MoEs you can dramatically reduce tuning costs without hurting performance too much.

[### Making Better Recommendations (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06217v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a new model called HAMUR to improve how models make suggestions or "recommendations" across multiple subjects or domains, like music, books, or movies. Unlike older methods that mix up information between these domains, HAMUR uses a special technique to keep data separate and more flexible.
