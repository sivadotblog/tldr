[### Agentic Search for Dummies (8 minute read)](https://benanderson.work/blog/agentic-search-for-dummies/?utm_source=tldrai)

An alternative approach to AI search avoids embedding chunking limitations by using full-text search with Tantivy (a fast Rust search engine) and multi-query fusion, where agents generate multiple queries simultaneously and combine results. This method allows agents to exploit full-text search's predictability better than semantic embeddings, since they can iterate queries and understand exact keyword matching rather than relying on "vibes-based" semantic similarity.
