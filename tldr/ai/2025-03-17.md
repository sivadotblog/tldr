[### Google's Response to U.S. AI Policy (6 minute read)](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-us-ai-action-plan-comments/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google outlines its vision for U.S. AI policy, advocating for investments in AI infrastructure, streamlined government adoption, and international pro-innovation standards to maintain leadership in the AI space.

[### Google Assistant is Replaced by Gemini (3 minute read)](https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-assistant-gemini-mobile/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google Assistant is transitioning into Gemini, a more personalized and AI-driven assistant designed to integrate with apps and services while leveraging generative AI.

[### Sakana claims its AI-generated paper passed peer review (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/sakana-claims-its-ai-paper-passed-peer-review-but-its-a-bit-more-nuanced-than-that/?utm_source=tldrai)

Japanese AI startup Sakana used its AI Scientist-v2 to generate a paper accepted at an ICLR workshop but withdrew its post-initial review due to transparency concerns. Though Sakana highlights AI's potential, critics argue that human judgment was crucial and acceptance was facilitated by higher workshop acceptance rates. Skeptics remain wary, emphasizing AI's technical flaws and the need for established norms to prevent degrading the scientific review process.

### Research & Innovation

[### Scaling Laws for DiLoCo (35 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09799?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepMind has released a paper detailing scaling laws for the powerful cross data center training algorithm DiLoCo. These show how stable model training can be even with gradients synchronized across continents.

[### Transformers without normalization (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10622?utm_source=tldrai)

Most Transformer models are normalized with a layer norm. This can be seen as equivalent to normalizing the model to a sphere. However, if you use carefully placed tanh functions, you can eliminate layer norm while maintaining stability. This is now equivalent to normalizing to a hypercube.

[### Speaker Identification with Whisper (9 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10446v1?utm_source=tldrai)

WSI repurposes the Whisper ASR encoder for multilingual speaker identification using joint loss optimization. It outperforms Pyannote, ECAPA TDNN, and Xvector in recognizing speakers across diverse languages and environments.
