[### Meta drops AI bombshell: Multi-token prediction models now open for research (4 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-drops-ai-bombshell-multi-token-prediction-models-now-open-for-research?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta has released pre-trained models that leverage a novel multi-token prediction approach that forecasts multiple future words simultaneously, promising enhanced performance and drastically reduced training times.

[### Google DeepMind's AI Rat Brains Could Make Robots Scurry Like the Real Thing (5 minute read)](https://singularityhub.com/2024/07/03/google-deepminds-ai-rat-brains-could-make-robots-scurry-like-the-real-thing/?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepMind and Harvard University developed a virtual rat with AI neural networks trained on actual rat movements and neural patterns to probe the brain circuits responsible for complex motor skills. This bio-inspired AI has the capacity to generalize learned movement skills to new environments, offering insights into brain function and advancing robotics. The research demonstrates that digital simulations can effectively mimic and decode neural activity related to different behaviors.
