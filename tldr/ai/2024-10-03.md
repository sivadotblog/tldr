[### Nylas ExtractAI: Turn user emails into structured data (Sponsor)](https://www.nylas.com/products/extractai/?utm_medium=sponsoredemail&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=20241003)

The world (still) runs on email. Invoices, product orders, travel plans - they're all in the inbox. But unstructured data and wildly disparate email formats make extracting the parts you need difficult.

[ExtractAI by Nylas](https://www.nylas.com/products/extractai/?utm_medium=sponsoredemail&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=20241003) is the new way to sync, filter, and extract user data. With just a few lines of code, you can now deploy advanced ML, NLP, and LLMs to [retrieve first-party data from your users' inboxes](https://www.nylas.com/products/extractai/?utm_medium=sponsoredemail&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=20241003):

* 92% cost savings compared to other AI / LLM tools
* 99.9% accuracy SLA for order data
* Real-time sync with no email forwarding required
