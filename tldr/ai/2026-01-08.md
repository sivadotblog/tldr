Dethroning Qwen in adoption in 2026 looks impossible, but there are areas of opportunity. The US could very well have the smartest open models again in 2026, even if they're used far less across the ecosystem. This post contains 8 plots that show the impact of Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama, GPT-OSS, Nemotron, and other new entrants to the ecosystem.

[### Context is the next data platform—and why context graphs are key to understanding processes (9 minute read)](https://x.com/jainarvind/status/2008965852381483258?utm_source=tldrai)

Context graphs shed light on how work really gets done in the enterprise. AI agents are a major unlock with automation, but only if their reasoning is grounded in the right enterprise context. It's not enough to just understand the enterprise data, systems also need relationship knowledge. Context graphs enable agents to learn and automate distributed work by capturing processes and learning intent over time.
