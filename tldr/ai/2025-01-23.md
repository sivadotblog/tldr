[### Contextual AI introduces a benchmark-beating platform for building specialized RAG agents (Sponsor)](https://contextual.ai/blog/contextual-ai-platform-generally-available/?utm_campaign=ga-launch-2025&amp;utm_source=tldrai&amp;utm_medium=email-ad&amp;utm_content=primary)

RAG isn't a solved problem. Building agents that can accurately retrieve information from enterprise data stores still requires AI teams to awkwardly cobble together different components, with accuracy and stability far from guaranteed.

However, with the [general availability of the Contextual AI Platform](https://contextual.ai/blog/contextual-ai-platform-generally-available/?utm_campaign=ga-launch-2025&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=email-ad&utm_content=primary), this is about to change:

* The platform enables teams to launch specialized RAG agents, capable of active retrieval and test-time compute over massive volumes of enterprise data.
* These agents deliver [exceptional accuracy in technical, complex, and knowledge-intensive workloads](https://contextual.ai/blog/contextual-ai-platform-generally-available/?utm_campaign=ga-launch-2025&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=email-ad&utm_content=primary) (investment analysis, engineering design support, technical research).
* In benchmarks, Contextual AI outperforms RAG systems built using leading models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o, in end-to-end accuracy.
