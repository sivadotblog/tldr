[### OpenAI just launched Advanced Voice for ChatGPT, but do you know how they built it? (Sponsor)](https://livekit.io/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=2024-10-10-tldr-ai)

They used [LiveKit Cloud](https://livekit.io/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2024-10-10-tldr-ai), infrastructure for real time voice AI apps. With it you can:

* Transport voice data with ultra-low latency
* Build apps that respond with human-level speed and emotion
* Handle interruptions, transcriptions, RAG, function calling, and more
* Support millions of concurrent agents running at the edge
* Tap into OpenAI's new Realtime API in 10 LOC

### Research & Innovation

[### LLMs Know More Than They Show: On the Intrinsic Representation of LLM Hallucinations (21 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02707?utm_source=tldrai)

Another study that shows language models encode internally when they aren't factual. This evidence can help us steer them and mitigate hallucinations.

[### Differential Transformer (33 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258?utm_source=tldrai)

Transformers tend to over-allocate attention to irrelevant context. This work introduces Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns

[### A Simpler CLIP Fine-Tuning (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05270v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces ProLIP, a method for adapting vision-language models like CLIP without adding extra parameters. By fine-tuning just the last projection matrix of the vision encoder, ProLIP achieves strong results in few-shot classification.
