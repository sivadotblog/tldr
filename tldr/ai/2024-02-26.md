[### 6 hard lessons we learned about automated testing for genAI apps (Sponsor)](https://www.qawolf.com/blog/6-lessons-learned-on-the-generative-ai-based-automated-testing-trail?utm_campaign=HardLessonsLearned02262024&amp;utm_source=tldrai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter)

Testing LLMs is not simple. Probabilistic output makes failures hard to identify, while running the models repeatedly tends to become very expensive quickly.

In this [blog post](https://www.qawolf.com/blog/6-lessons-learned-on-the-generative-ai-based-automated-testing-trail?utm_campaign=HardLessonsLearned02262024&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter), QA Wolf engineer John Gluck covers 6 things the team learned about building [automated black-box regression tests for genAI applications](https://www.qawolf.com/blog/6-lessons-learned-on-the-generative-ai-based-automated-testing-trail?utm_campaign=HardLessonsLearned02262024&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter), including:

* Writing deterministic tests for non-deterministic outputs
* How to control costs (where possible)
* Should you use AI to test AI?

[### Is OpenAI the next challenger trying to take on Google Search? (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24073320/is-openai-the-next-challenger-trying-to-take-on-google-search?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is working on a web search to compete more directly with Google. It is unclear if the product will be standalone or part of ChatGPT. Competition in the search space is filling up quickly with the addition of Copilot on Bing, newcomers like Perplexity, and Google's Gemini Copilot. A YouTube Short featuring Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella talking about competing with Google is available in the article.

[### Google admits it lost control of image-generating AI (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/23/embarrassing-and-wrong-google-admits-it-lost-control-of-image-generating-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google has acknowledged an issue with its AI model Gemini. The model injected inappropriate diversity into historical images, reflecting problems with bias in training data. The flaw sparked debate around diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech. Google implied that it will make improvements in the future but stopped short of a full apology for failing to properly contextualize historical figures in image generation.

### Research & Innovation

[### Simpler RL algorithms beat PPO (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14740?utm_source=tldrai)

REINFORCE is a simple, standard, and easily understood RL method. It is hard to train stably when used in simulators. PPO is much more performant and stable in general. Gemini uses REINFORCE and GPT-4 is believed to use PPO.

[### Flow Matching for Generating Proteins (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04845?utm_source=tldrai)

AlphaFold is used to predict the state of a protein after folding. By adding flow matching, which is invertible, you can dramatically improve modeling power on the entire landscape of proteins.

[### Efficient LLMs with Expert-Level Sparsification (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/lucky-lance/expert_sparsity?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a new way to make LLMs more efficient and easier to use by employing a method that focuses on 'expert-level sparsification', which reduces model size without losing performance. This is particularly useful for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, which are powerful but usually too big to handle easily.
