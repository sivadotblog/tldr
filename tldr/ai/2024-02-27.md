### Research & Innovation

[### A New Way to Test LLMs Math Skills (15 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14660v1?utm_source=tldrai)

ConceptMath is a new bilingual benchmark for testing LLMs‚Äô math skills in both English and Chinese. It's unique because it breaks down math problems into specific concepts, allowing for a more detailed assessment of an AI's strengths and weaknesses in math.

[### MobileLLM (21 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14905?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta has proposed a 350m parameter language model with strong reasoning performance, even approaching Llama 7B on correctness in API function calling tasks. The model has not been released, but the innovation in fixed parameter models is worth exploring.

[### Predicting the Ideal Next Choice of the User with DreamRec (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20453v1?utm_source=tldrai)

DreamRec introduced a novel 'learning-to-generate' approach to sequential recommendation where instead of the traditional method of classifying user preferences from a mix of positive and negative items, it creates an 'oracle' item that represents the ideal next choice for the user.

[### Human Motion Generation (2 minute read)](https://barquerogerman.github.io/FlowMDM/?utm_source=tldrai)

FlowMDM is a new model for generating long, continuous human motion sequences from text descriptions. This first-of-its-kind diffusion-based model uses Blended Positional Encodings for realistic motion creation without extra denoising steps, excelling in accuracy and realism on key datasets.

[### Enhancing Autoregressive Models with Future Tokens (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/jakespringer/echo-embeddings?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces echo embeddings, a novel strategy that overcomes a key limitation of autoregressive models by incorporating future token information. This is achieved by repeating input twice, which significantly improves performance on benchmark tasks while being compatible with other embedding enhancement methods.

[### Visual Speech Recognition with Language Models (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/sally-sh/vsp-llm?utm_source=tldrai)

The VSP-LLM framework introduces a new approach to visual speech recognition and translation by integrating LLMs. It efficiently processes video inputs by deduplicating embedded visual features and employing Low-Rank Adaptors for cost-effective training.
