### Headlines & Launches

[### Introducing W&B Prompts (8 minute read)](https://wandb.ai/wandb/wb-announcements/reports/Introducing-W-B-Prompts-The-Present-Future-of-LLMOps--Vmlldzo0MTI4NjY5?utm_source=tldrai)

Weights & Biases (W&B) announces the release of W&B Prompts, a suite of LLMOps tools designed for prompt engineers working with large language models (LLMs). The new tools include one-line LangChain and OpenAI integrations for logging, W&B Launch integration with OpenAI Evals, and improved handling of text in W&B Tables. W&B also introduces a JavaScript SDK for prompt exploration and model generation tracking. In addition, the company is publishing a whitepaper on LLM training best practices, releasing two LLM courses on fine-tuning and LLMOps, and open sourcing WandBot, a GPT-4 powered support bot.

[### Bard can help you code (2 minute read)](https://blog.google/technology/ai/code-with-bard/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google‚Äôs language model Bard, when launched, refused to answer coding questions. That has changed now. It can help you code in a huge variety of languages and does a pretty good job! There hasn‚Äôt been any official validation released, so we don‚Äôt know how it compares to other program synthesis models, but it‚Äôs always nice to have options.

[### Mind and Brain (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691468/google-ai-deepmind-brain-merger?utm_source=tlrdai)

Deepmind and Google Brain are now one org led by Demis Hassabis from Brain. The goal is to build AI focus internally to compete with much of the external pressures from groups like OpenAI. One interesting pivot here is that the new group, called Google Deepmind, has an explicitly stated goal of ‚ÄúAI products‚Äù which is somewhat of a departure from the previous group's focus.

### Research & Innovation

[### Multi-Modal Face Generation and Editing (3 minute read)](https://ziqihuangg.github.io/projects/collaborative-diffusion.html?utm_source=tldrai)

The paper introduces Collaborative Diffusion, a method that combines pre-trained uni-modal diffusion models to achieve multi-modal face generation and editing without retraining. By utilizing a dynamic diffuser meta-network, the approach effectively hallucinates multi-modal denoising steps and integrates multiple uni-modal manipulations, demonstrating superior image quality and condition consistency in extensive experiments.

[### Theory of Adam instability (20 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09871?utm_source=tldrai)

The Meta folks have been training some big models recently. Part of the pain of that is loss spikes. This is where training diverges and usually requires manual intervention to get things back on track. This paper outlines a hypothesis for these spikes. They claim that Adam is the culprit. Maybe some of the new optimizers like Lion or Shampoo can help?

[### Real-Time View Synthesis (3 minute read)](http://raywzy.com/NDRF/?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper presents a novel method that distills and bakes Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) into efficient mesh-based neural representations, enabling real-time rendering and compatibility with parallel graphics pipelines. The approach uses a two-layer duplex mesh, screen-space convolutions, and a multiview distillation optimization strategy, resulting in superior performance and effectiveness demonstrated through experiments on standard datasets.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Llama Academy (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/danielgross/LlamaAcademy?utm_source=tldrai)

It seems like everywhere you look people are building retrieval augmentation into language models. Here is another tool to do that, using the almost-open sourced Llama models. This one has a nice recipe you can follow to teach the model about novel APIs and SDKs.

[### 4 new ControlNet models (HuggingFace)](https://huggingface.co/thibaud?utm_source=tldrai)

ControlNet is a great way to use StableDiffusion to generate images with more control over the shape of the output. There are a few new models now trained such as the Normal Map, Segmentation, LineArt, and Openpose with hands and face.

[### Voice cloning (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark?utm_source=tldrai)

Transformers continue their march into all modalities, this time taking on audio with a cool voice cloning tool. There are some limitations, but with just a few seconds of audio, you can get a pretty great representation of your voice.
