### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### LLMs as Judges (19 minute read)](https://open.substack.com/pub/aashidutt/p/llms-as-judges-measuring-bias-hinting?utm_source=tldrai)

This post investigates whether large language models are fair judges when evaluating other LLMs. Using a modified MT-Bench benchmark, it reveals the influence of vendor identity, model tier, and hinting on evaluation outcomes across domains like coding, reasoning, and writing.

[### Chinese AI models have lagged the US frontier by 7 months on average since 2023 (2 minute read)](https://epoch.ai/data-insights/us-vs-china-eci?utm_source=tldrai)

Every model at the frontier of AI capabilities has been developed in the United States since 2023. Chinese models have trailed US capabilities by an average of seven months over that period. The gap resembles the broader gap between proprietary and open-weight models. All leading Chinese models are open-weight, while frontier US models remain closed.

[### Existential Risk and Growth (127 minute read)](https://philiptrammell.com/static/Existential_Risk_and_Growth.pdf?utm_source=tldrai)

While technological development raises consumption, it may be a potential existential risk. However, technological development can also lower risk by speeding up technological solutions or increasing a planner's willingness to pay for safety. The risk-minimizing technology growth rate is typically positive and may easily be high. Below this rate, technological development poses no tradeoff between consumption and cumulative risk.

[### Three GPU Markets, Three Volatility Regimes (9 minute read)](https://davefriedman.substack.com/p/three-gpu-markets-three-volatility?utm_source=tldrai)

Spare capacity determines price volatility in commodity markets. The 'GPU shortage' doesn't accurately describe what's happening in the market: newer GPUs are experiencing more volatility due to utilization. GPU markets are differentiating by maturity. As each market continues to develop, it should move towards a pattern where high utilization is a signal of market health rather than market stress.

[### Anthropic's ‘do more with less' bet has kept it at the AI frontier, co-founder Amodei tells CNBC (14 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/03/anthropic-daniela-amodei-do-more-with-less-bet.html?utm_source=tldrai)

'Do more with less' has become a sort of governing principle for Anthropic's entire strategy. It is a direct challenge to the rest of the industry, which is treating scale as destiny. Anthropic believes that disciplined spending, algorithmic efficiency, and smarter deployment can keep it at the frontier. The startup has always had a fraction of what its competitors have had in terms of compute and capital, yet it has consistently produced the most powerful and performant models.
