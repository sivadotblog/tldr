### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Building AI Products In The Probabilistic Era (26 minute read)](https://giansegato.com/essays/probabilistic-era?utm_source=tldrai)

People have always been skeptical of new technologies, but the world eventually catches up and reaches a new equilibrium. AI is shuffling the deck again, making many past playbooks obsolete. For the first time in the digital era, marginal costs are way larger than zero. This means the way we produce products needs to be radically different. Organizations that build using an empirical approach, think in probabilities, and measure complex trajectories will define the next era of technology.

[### Questioning Margins is a Boring Cliche‚Ä¶ (11 minute read)](https://a16z.com/questioning-margins-is-a-boring-cliche/?utm_source=tldrai)

Lower gross margins at a moment in time are not a long-term indicator of a lack of a sustainable business model. AI applications deliver deep customer value, strong usage and retention, and explosive net expansion. Margins alone don't tell the full story. Fixating on margins while ignoring a company's value to its customers, retention, and ease of acquisition misses the mark. There are many effective strategies for AI app companies to drive healthy margins in the long term.

[### Do you have too many AI products? (11 minute read)](https://frontierai.substack.com/p/do-you-have-too-many-ai-products?utm_source=tldrai)

People who buy AI tools should avoid purchasing redundant tools and focus on actual impact. They should have clear goals and know what business problems they're solving with AI and the impact that's going to have. Builders should be careful about how they position their products and be clear about their value propositions. The boring stuff matters, as that's what allows enterprises to confidently use products in their workflows.

One of the biggest topics in AI these days is that AI is going to move from chatbots to reliably completing real-world tasks. However, agents really aren't all that reliable right now. There's a lot of work happening in the AI industry to try to fix that. In this interview, David Luan, the head of Amazon's AGI research lab, talks about why progress on AI models has slowed and predictions for what's next in the industry.
