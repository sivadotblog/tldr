### Research & Innovation

[### Making Self-Driving Cars Smarter with Language Prompts (15 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04379v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces NuPrompt, a new set of instructions in everyday language that helps self-driving cars understand and track objects around them better. It works really well!

[### A Better Understanding and Reasoning About Pictures (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04461v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The authors of this study have created a way to test how well vision-language models can also think logically about what they see.

[### Speed up speculative decoding without a draft model (8 minute read)](https://together.ai/blog/medusa?utm_source=tldrai)

Language model inference is generally slow because these models are heavily memory-bound. So people have introduced speculative decoding using a smaller draft model to “run ahead” and offer suggestions to the large model. This works well, but it’s complicated to implement, and finding a good draft model is tough. Instead, you can create a Medusa model that acts as its own draft by splitting off activations from various internal stages. This speeds up Llama 2x without compromising performance.

[### Another group of writers is suing OpenAI over copyright claims (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/11/23869145/writers-sue-openai-chatgpt-copyright-claims?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI faces a lawsuit from writers alleging illegal use of their copyrighted works to train ChatGPT. They argue that ChatGPT's capabilities to summarize and analyze their content indicate direct training on their works, constituting copyright infringement. This follows similar suits from other authors against OpenAI.

[### Can LLMs Reason? (10 minute read)](https://aiguide.substack.com/p/can-large-language-models-reason?utm_source=tldrai)

The debate surrounding large language models concerns whether they possess human-like reasoning abilities or rely on memorization and pattern-matching, with studies showing mixed results. Evaluating LLMs for true abstract reasoning is challenging due to their tendency to excel in tasks related to their training data, necessitating further research for clarification.
