### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Vibe Coding Without System Design is a Trap (16 minute read)](https://www.focusedchaos.co/p/vibe-coding-without-system-design-is-a-trap?utm_source=tldrai)

AI-assisted coding streamlines product creation but often sacrifices long-term design sustainability. It prioritizes immediate functionality, leading to hardcoded configurations, which are fragile for future updates. Successful product development requires experienced system design to avoid a "build-now, regret-later" scenario, transforming AI vibes into structured, sustainable solutions.

[### The All-Star Chinese AI Conversation of 2026 (72 minute read)](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/the-all-star-chinese-ai-conversation?utm_source=tldrai)

Tsinghua University and Zhipu co-hosted AGI-Next, a summit for frontier AI, in Beijing on January 10. The event included a series of keynotes by notable figures in the Chinese AI industry. This post contains a translated transcript of the event, revealing a fascinating conversation about the AI landscape in China that covers the technical side, corporate dynamics, as well as the future envisioned by China's industry Titans. The event took an honest look at whether China's open-source leadership has actually narrowed the technology gap with the US, China's emerging AI-for-business paradigm, and what it will take for Chinese researchers to take riskier bets.

[### Introducing the AI Chip Sales Data Explorer (2 minute read)](https://epoch.ai/blog/introducing-the-ai-chip-sales-data-explorer?utm_source=tldrai)

The AI Chip Sales data explorer uses financial reports, company disclosures, and more to estimate compute, power usage, and spending over time for a wide variety of AI chips. The cumulative global AI compute capacity has reached the equivalent of more than 15 million Nvidia H100 GPUs. The cost to purchase these chips has rapidly escalated to tens of billions of dollars per quarter, drawing over 10 GW of power per quarter. A link to the interactive data explorer is available.
