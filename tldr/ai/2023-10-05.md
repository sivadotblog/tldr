### Headlines & Launches

[### The Mobile Revolution vs. The AI Revolution (12 minute read)](https://www.digitalnative.tech/p/the-mobile-revolution-vs-the-ai-revolution?utm_source=tldrai)

AI is a technological revolution more akin to the invention of the internet than the proliferation of smartphones, as computers will no longer act like calculators, but as something like the human brain.

[### Yahoo spins out Vespa, the enterprise AI scaling engine as an independent company (2 minute read)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231004777364/en/Yahoo-Spins-Out-Vespa-Its-Enterprise-AI-Scaling-Engine-as-an-Independent-Company?utm_source=tldrai)

Used by companies such as Spotify, Wix, and big financial groups - the Vespa AI engine is now being spun off. Yahoo is still their largest customer and financial backer. The engine is performant and can handle millions of queries per second.

[### Microsoft CEO Testifies About Limits of AI at Google Antitrust Trial (5 minute read)](https://archive.ph/PLzds?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified in the U.S. antitrust case against Google, claiming Google's dominance in internet search is maintained through unfair tactics, including default agreements with Apple. Despite investments in AI and new features for Bing, Microsoft struggles to break Google's market stronghold. Nadella hinted that even with AI advancements, changing default habits might remain challenging.

### Research & Innovation

[### Deep dive: Running SDXL in Jax on TPU v5 (18 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/sdxl_jax?utm_source=tldrai)

SDXL is a state of the art image generation model. It is powerful, but slow. Google and HuggingFace showcase just how fast it can be on the new TPU chips in Google's research language Jax.

[### Knowledge Editing in LLMs (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02129v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Think of LLMs like big, intricate puzzles with pieces of knowledge. This paper looks at what happens if we try to change some of those pieces - it could either mess up the whole puzzle or make it unclear.

[### Think before you speak: Adding a pause token to LLMs improves reasoning (20 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02226?utm_source=tldrai)

The recent work on registers for ViTs showed that adding a [reg] token fixes image attention map spikes. This work shows that adding a series of learnable [pause] tokens prepended to the sequence improves language model reasoning (decoder only, up to 1B) by as much as 18%. The intuition is that this adds a number of learnable and manipulatable vectors to store important global information to be used while generating the sequence. In general, adding tokens has scaled well past 13B parameters, but it's unclear how well this works at frontier model scale.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Do LLMs Work Well Together Like Humans Do? (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02124v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper studies how LLMs might work together in groups, just like people in a society. Researchers have made computer "societies" with different personalities and watched them team up on tasks, finding they sometimes act like humans - like following the majority or debating - and some teams work better than others.

[### MiniGPT-5: A New Way to Generate Images and Text Together (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/eric-ai-lab/minigpt-5?utm_source=tldrai)

Imagine a model that not only understands and writes text but can also create matching pictures. This new model, MiniGPT-5, uses special techniques called "generative vokens" to do that.

[### Distributed Shampoo optimizer in Pytorch (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/optimizers/tree/main/distributed_shampoo?utm_source=tldrai)

AI systems consist of architecture, data, and training methods. Optimizers fit solidly in the third group. Adam is the current crowd favorite because it "just works". LION and Shampoo are two alternatives that have been gaining adoption. Having an implementation in Pytorch from Meta is a solid stamp of approval.

[### Prompt engineering for Claude's long context window (12 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/index/prompting-long-context?utm_source=tldrai)

Claude's new 100,000 token capacity improves technical document recall using two techniques. Anthropic has released the "Anthropic Cookbook" for hands-on experiments with Claude.

[### Is AI A Platform Shift? (2 minute read)](https://matt-rickard.com/is-ai-a-platform-shift?utm_source=tldrai)

A platform shift alters the foundational layer of application development, influencing company dominance, architectures, and business models. Given its potential to change distribution and expand possibilities, AI is poised to become a significant platform shift, challenging existing structures and introducing new paradigms.
