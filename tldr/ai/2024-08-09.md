India's technology outsourcing industry is facing a pivot as AI integration threatens jobs, especially in basic tasks like call centers. Companies are challenged to ascend the value chain amidst a hiring slowdown, with some hopeful AI tools will create new opportunities in sectors like programming. The industry's future demands higher-level cognitive skills as automation continues to redefine traditional roles.

[### Why AI hasn't shown up in the GDP statistics yet (7 minute read)](https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/why-ai-hasnt-shown-up-in-the-gdp?utm_source=tldrai)

Despite impressive progress in LLMs solving complex tasks, they still fall short on consistently performing human-like tasks at scale. LLMs require detailed prompt engineering and iteration to achieve acceptable accuracy, limiting their current potential as direct human replacements in workflows. OpenAI's recent updates to JSON output control and cost reduction may address some issues, but the nuanced integration required for LLMs in organizational contexts suggests incremental productivity gains rather than immediate economic transformation.

Breakthroughs in AI pre-training have enabled models to process massive online datasets, while subsequent supervised fine-tuning with experts helps models generalize and gain specialized knowledge. Turing's approach of using "input and output pairs" generated by subject-matter experts aims to advance AI reasoning capabilities. Anticipating an "agentic" era of AI, these models could autonomously perform complex tasks by integrating specialized knowledge across domains.
