[### Stylized image binning algorithm (3 minute read)](https://benjdd.com/posts/stylized-image-binning-algorithm/?utm_source=tldrai)

This is a tutorial on creating a pixel-art-like image processing tool with interactive web elements like sliders for customization using a binning algorithm in JavaScript. The binning technique uses parameters such as bin size and gap to convert images into stylized, pixelated artwork by averaging pixel brightness within bins. The implementation involves manipulating pixel data on HTML canvas elements and optimizing looping structures for efficiency.

[### Using LLMs to Generate Fuzz Generators (8 minute read)](https://verse.systems/blog/post/2024-03-09-using-llms-to-generate-fuzz-generators/?utm_source=tldrai)

LLMs like Claude can generate effective fuzzers for parsing code, automating a process that traditionally requires significant human effort. While LLMs are typically not precise enough for static analysis, they appear well-suited for creating fuzzers due to the stochastic nature of fuzzing. A hybrid approach that combines LLM-driven static analysis and targeted fuzzing could be promising for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in code.
