[### 8bit Hippo Attention may be 3x Faster than Flash Attention v2 (4 minute read)](https://blog.hippoml.com/8bit-hippoattention-up-to-3x-faster-compared-to-flashattentionv2-8f9def90b482?utm_source=tldrai)

A quantization-aware attention alternative that speeds up inference substantially over some state-of-the-art implementations. Its creators also claim 700 TFLOPs on MI-300X. The details are sparse, but it would be quite an achievement if so.

[### Mega Dolphin Pass Through Merge (4 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/MegaDolphin-120b?utm_source=tldrai)

Dolphin is widely considered to be one of the strongest uncensored open models available. It is mainly built on Mixtral. This 120B model was made by merging two smaller Dolphin models together. It has been found, with Goliath 120B, that this merging process can improve overall model performance.

[### New Benchmark for Code Generation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/FlagOpen/TACO?utm_source=tldrai)

TACO is a new benchmark for assessing a system‚Äôs ability to generate code. It is substantially larger than existing datasets and contains more challenging problems. On easy problems, GPT-4 gets 30% correct, while it only achieves 2% on the hardest subset of questions.
