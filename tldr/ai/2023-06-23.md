### Research & Innovation

[### Tart: Boosting the Reasoning Abilities of LLMs (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07536v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study uncovers that large language models (LLMs) can handle different tasks, but struggle with probabilistic reasoning, which limits their performance. The authors propose a solution named Tart - a reasoning module trained in a generic manner, which, when combined with any pre-existing model, significantly improves its reasoning capabilities and overall performance across various tasks and modalities.

[### MPT 30B released (7 minute read)](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-30b?utm_source=tldrai)

MPT is a series of language models from MosaicML. Their 7B model has been downloaded millions of times in just a few short weeks since launch. This next model, 30B, was trained on H100s and has an 8k context length. It is commercially licensed and can even code! It fits on a single A100 in fp16 / fp8 precision.

### Engineering & Resources

[### A More Efficient ResNets (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/nikunj-gupta/efficient_resnets?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers proposed a compact ResNet model outperforms the larger ResNet18, reaching 96.04% test accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset while using fewer than 5 million trainable parameters, ideal for storage-limited devices.

[### A Faster Alternative to the Segment Anything Model (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/casia-iva-lab/fastsam?utm_source=tldrai)

This repo introduces a speedy new method that performs as well as the recently proposed Segment Anything (SAM) model, a tool used in computer vision for tasks like image segmentation and captioning. This new technique uses a more standard approach called instance segmentation, achieving similar results but 50 times faster, making it more practical for real-world use.

[### Kaguya (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ykdojo/kaguya?utm_source=tldrai)

A ChatGPT plugin that allows you to load and edit your local files in a controlled way as well as run any Python, JavaScript, and bash script.

The human labor behind AI models is often overlooked. Data annotators, who evaluate and improve AI responses, work long hours to make AI chatbots behave as intended. The work can be brutal and upsetting, with data workers in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya often exploited to clean up online hate and misinformation. These workers are now unionizing for better working conditions.
