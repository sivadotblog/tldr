### Research & Innovation

[### Evaluation Metric for Text-to-3D Models (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04092v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a new evaluation metric for text-to-3D generative models, addressing the limitations of current single-criterion metrics. This advanced method uses GPT-4V to create prompts and compare 3D assets. It aligns closely with human preferences and offers versatility by adapting to various user-defined criteria.

[### Mixtral of Experts paper (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04088?utm_source=tldrai)

The Mixtral paper has been released. There is no discussion of pretraining datasets. Most of the things disclosed are well known, but there is an interesting new insight on the discussion of routing evaluation between experts.

[### A minimalist approach to alignment (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04056?utm_source=tldrai)

Google researchers have introduced Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPO), a simpler form of alignment than traditional RLHF. The researchers turned to game theory and figured out single-player self play dynamics that are robust to noisy preferences and give strong performance.
