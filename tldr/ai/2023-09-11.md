### Research & Innovation

[### Finding the Basketball in 3D Space (8 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03640v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The authors of this study developed a new way to accurately figure out where a basketball is in 3D space using just one photo, which is a big deal for things like sports analytics and robotics.

[### Can ChatGPT Help You Find Your Next Favorite Movie or Book? (45 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03613v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study looks at how well ChatGPT can suggest movies or books you might like.

[### Carving 3D Clothed Humans using 2D Diffusion Probabilistic Models (3 minute read)](https://snuvclab.github.io/chupa/?utm_source=tldrai)

If you use a diffusion model to generate 2D normal maps, which contain distance and shape information, and then use a 3D reconstruction algorithm, you can generate realistic 3D human avatars using an underlying body model. This is useful for synthetic avatars and character creation.

[### End-to-end test coverage with zero flakes. For humans, by humans (Sponsor)](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=EndToEndZeroFlakes09112023&amp;utm_source=tldrai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter)

Can AI get you to 80% automated test coverage within 4 months? Maybe one day. Until then, there‚Äôs [QA Wolf](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=EndToEndZeroFlakes09112023&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter). They‚Äôll write your entire test suite in open-source Playwright (you own the code!) AND provide the infra to run it in 100% parallel on every deploy (unlimited test runs included!). Maintenance? Yep, that‚Äôs on them too (even full refactors!). Even AI companies like Cohere use them!

Meta has introduced an opt-out tool allowing Facebook users to delete personal data used in training generative AI models. The "Generative AI Data Subject Rights" form focuses on third-party information, which includes publicly available data or licensed sources. The move comes as data privacy concerns rise, with international agencies urging tech companies to adhere to global data protection and privacy laws.

[### Product-Led AI from Greylock (11 minute read)](https://greylock.com/greymatter/seth-rosenberg-product-led-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Investors are shifting focus from backing AI enablers like NVIDIA to supporting founders building transformative, AI-first products that redefine work and life. Three major AI-first opportunities include AI-first networks and marketplaces transitioning from human-driven to algorithmic content creation, redefining enterprise software categories where AI becomes the main feature, and AI "co-pilot" augmenting services, especially in areas like wealth management. The potential extends beyond software, tapping into vast service markets.
