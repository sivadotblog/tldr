[### Using embeddings in computer vision (12 minute read)](https://blog.roboflow.com/embeddings-clustering-computer-vision-clip-umap/?utm_source=tldrai)

Embeddings are machine-readable lists of numbers that represent some information about a piece of data. They are increasingly obtained by running the data through a neural network and looking at the activations of the model. This post pushes that idea forward with CLIP on a computer vision task and explores how to use dimensionality reduction to reason about the learned embeddings.
