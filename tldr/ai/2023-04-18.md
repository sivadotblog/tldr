### Headlines & Launches

[### Dataset released to reproduce Llama training (4 minute read)](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama?utm_source=tldrai)

The Llama models from Meta are powerful but unusable for many commercial applications due to licensing restrictions. However, because they‚Äôre so good, lots of folks have been building on top of them. It starts to get tricky when people go to deploy them, however, and often it is a complete impossibility. In the Llama paper they describe the training mix proportions which have now been reproduced as a 1.2 Trillion token dataset. Open models are coming soon.

[### Elon Musk claims to be working on ‚ÄòTruthGPT‚Äô ‚Äî a ‚Äòmaximum truth-seeking AI‚Äô (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/17/23687440/elon-musk-truthgpt-ai-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrai)

Elon Musk has revealed plans to work on "TruthGPT," an AI alternative to ChatGPT that aims to maximize truth-seeking. Musk shared his vision during a Fox News interview, stating that an AI focused on understanding the universe would be less likely to harm humans. He suggests that OpenAI's profit incentives might compromise the ethics of its AI models and sees TruthGPT as a more transparent option. Musk's new AI company, X.AI, was established in March, but it remains unclear how far along the development of TruthGPT is.

[### AI readiness report (12 minute read)](https://scale.com/ai-readiness-report?utm_source=tldrai)

56%-72% of companies have accelerated their AI plans because of the recent generative AI progress. Many of these groups prefer to use open source technology, while OpenAI's APIs are the dominant closed models being used. The report outlines industries adopting AI technologies and good things to know to help cut through the hype.

### Research & Innovation

[### Multimodal C4: An Open, Billion-scale Corpus of Images Interleaved With Text (6 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06939?utm_source=tldrai)

Multimodal C4 (mmc4) is a publicly available dataset that augments the text-only c4 corpus with interleaved images, supporting in-context vision and language models like Flamingo. The dataset, created using a linear assignment algorithm with CLIP features, covers everyday topics and contains 103M documents, 585M images, and 43B English tokens, with 90% of images being topically relevant.

[### Cerebras-GPT: Efficient, Scalable Language Models with Open Compute (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03208?utm_source=tldrai)

Cerebras-GPT, a family of compute-optimal language models, demonstrates state-of-the-art training efficiency on pre-training and downstream objectives by leveraging advances in efficient pretraining, scaling, and Maximal Update Parameterization. As the first open and reproducible work comparing compute-optimal model scaling, pre-trained models and code are publicly released.

[### Instruction Tuning with GPT-4 (8 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03277?utm_source=tldrai)

Utilizing GPT-4-generated instruction-following data for LLaMA finetuning, researchers achieve superior zero-shot performance on new tasks in both English and Chinese, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models. This breakthrough is accompanied by comprehensive evaluation and reward model training, with the data and codebase made publicly available.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Soundini: Sound-Guided Diffusion for Natural Video Editing (3 minute read)](https://kuai-lab.github.io/soundini-gallery/?utm_source=tldrai)

The proposed method introduces zero-shot sound-guided visual effects for video editing, utilizing temporal sound features to create dynamic styles while maintaining temporal consistency. By guiding denoising diffusion probabilistic models with audio latent representations and using optical flow-based guidance, the approach outperforms existing techniques, generating realistic visual effects that correspond with sound properties.

[### Multilingual text2image model (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-2?utm_source=tldrai)

A nice new text to image model that can handle multiple languages. The output is high quality as it was trained on LAION HighRes and an internal proprietary dataset of images. It doesn‚Äôt work with diffusers, but they have an online demo. It seems to have more parameters than stable diffusion but might be smaller than the new XL model in the works.

[### Inpaint Anything (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/geekyutao/Inpaint-Anything?utm_source=tldrai)

Inpaint Anything (IA) is a new mask-free image inpainting paradigm that combines various models to create a powerful and user-friendly solution for inpainting tasks. IA offers three main features: Remove Anything, Fill Anything, and Replace Anything, allowing users to edit images using clicks and text-based prompts seamlessly.
