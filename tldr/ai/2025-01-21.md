### Headlines & Launches

[### DeepSeek's New Reasoning Model Surpasses OpenAI's o1 (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/deepseek-claims-its-reasoning-model-beats-openais-o1-on-certain-benchmarks/?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepSeek says that its latest reasoning-focused AI model outperforms OpenAI's O1 model on specific benchmarks, citing improvements in logical inference and factual accuracy.

[### OpenAI quietly funded independent math benchmark before setting record with o3 (4 minute read)](https://the-decoder.com/openai-quietly-funded-independent-math-benchmark-before-setting-record-with-o3/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's record success with the o3 model on the FrontierMath benchmark revealed its undisclosed funding of the project. Despite excellence in solving complex math problems, a lapse in transparency was admitted by benchmark developer Epoch AI. Future collaboration promises improved openness, particularly regarding funding and data access.

[### Perplexity AI submits bid to merge with TikTok (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/18/perplexity-ai-submits-bid-to-merge-with-tiktok/?utm_source=tldrai)

Perplexity AI has submitted a bid to merge with TikTok US as a TikTok ban approaches. The proposal aims to combine Perplexity, TikTok US, and new equity partners while allowing ByteDance investors to retain their equity. Perplexity's merger offer seeks to integrate more video content into its AI search operations.

[### Evolving Deeper LLM Thinking (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09891?utm_source=tldrai)

Contrary to the direct R1 approach, this work from DeepMind uses an evolutionary strategy, guided by a language model, to modify and propose new responses. This leads to strong reasoning ability, specifically in planning tasks that require some exploration.

[### DeepSeek R1 Paper (18 minute read)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepSeek has released a paper along with its strong MIT licensed reasoning models. Importantly, the paper shows that there is no need for extremely fancy process reward models. DeepSeek simply used accuracy of answer, a formatting reward, and large scale RL to encourage reasoning in the model. It found that distilling this reasoning ability via SFT to smaller models gave an incredible boost in final performance.
