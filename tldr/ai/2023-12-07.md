### Research & Innovation

[### A Benchmark to Test Large Multimodal Models (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/AIFEG/BenchLMM?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces BenchLMM, a benchmark designed to test the robustness of Large Multimodal Models like GPT-4V and LLaVA against various image styles.

[### Describe differences between sets of images (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02974?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper uses natural language to describe what is different between two collections of images. This is a novel problem and a challenging one. The solution involves captioning and reranking the individual images and summarizing them with a language model.

[### 3D Object Detection with Diffusion Models (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02966v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed Diffusion-SS3D, a new method to improve semi-supervised 3D object detection using diffusion models. This approach involves adding noise to object size and class label distributions in 3D space and then using the diffusion model to denoise and generate better bounding box outputs.

Lightspeed shares insights from Google and TitanML about the ins and outs of optimizing LLMs whether via prompting or fine-tuning.

[### Exploring Leap-of-Thought Abilities in LLMs (4 minute read)](https://zhongshsh.github.io/CLoT/?utm_source=tldrai)

This study introduces the use of the Oogiri humor generation game to explore the Leap-of-Thought capabilities in multimodal LLMs. This approach challenges LLMs to exhibit non-sequential thinking, a skill crucial for generating creative and humorous responses to various types of multimodal information.

[### Slow-burn AI: When augmentation, not automation, is the real threat (8 minute read)](https://platforms.substack.com/p/slow-burn-ai-when-augmentation-not?utm_source=tldrai)

While automation will likely be the way of the future, today, it‚Äôs all about augmenting your existing processes/self without having to rip and replace everything. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of just augmenting yourself to do your job better - thinking through what and how to automate things and viewing your role holistically will allow you to find the best use of AI for your needs.
