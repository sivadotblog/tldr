As Lovable soared to $100MM ARR in just 8 months, their team needed a new way to price AI. Yet even though traditional SaaS pricing models are breaking down, it's not clear what will take their place.

In [this live webinar](https://metronome.com/webinars/monetization-operating-model-webinar-series?utm_campaign=monetization-wp&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_content=), Elena Verna will share the pricing strategies her team uses to better reflect the value that AI delivers. [Join to learn](https://metronome.com/webinars/monetization-operating-model-webinar-series?utm_campaign=monetization-wp&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_content=):

1️⃣ Why AI has upended the logic of SaaS pricing and why there's still no clear playbook.

2️⃣ How Lovable is navigating the tension between self-serve and enterprise monetization.

3️⃣ What it takes to evolve from usage-based pricing toward outcomes-based value.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Ilya Sutskever – We're moving from the age of scaling to the age of research (83 minute read)](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/ilya-sutskever-2?utm_source=tldrai)

This post contains a transcript of an interview with Ilya Sutskever, former chief scientist at OpenAI and co-founder of Safe Superintelligence. In the interview, he discusses model jaggedness, emotions and value functions, why humans generalize better than models, alignment, and more. Sutskever says that current models generalize dramatically worse than people and that it is a very fundamental thing. Scaling has gotten big - it's time to get back to research to continue creating improvements.

[### LLM | Unit Economics (7 minute read)](https://robonomics.substack.com/p/llm-unit-economics?r=3hcp4&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI and Anthropic likely won't ever stop training entirely. However, they don't need to grow training spend by multiples forever. The moment annual training spend stops growing 5x a year, profit margins will show up almost immediately. These companies are currently burn machines, but they won't always be.
