[### The Memory Wars: Why AI's Future Depends on 16-Hi HBM (4 minute read)](https://x.com/benitoz/status/2005349615823183897?utm_source=tldrai)

AI is hitting a memory bottleneck: massive models need terabytes of fast memory. NVIDIA's 16-Hi HBM orders, 3D-stacked SRAM, and Groq deal aim to fix this, enabling near-instant inference and huge model scales. The result: AI can finally reach its potential in chat, robotics, and scientific discovery, shifting the limit from hardware to imagination.

[### How AI Is Reshaping Entry-Level Tech Jobs (7 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-effect-entry-level-jobs?utm_source=tldrai)

AI reshapes entry-level tech roles by automating routine tasks, leading to a 25% decline in hiring at major tech firms. Despite a drop in programmer jobs, positions like information security analysts and AI engineers are growing. Education must adapt, emphasizing AI proficiency and experiential learning, while apprenticeship models offer practical experience and bridge skill gaps.

### Engineering & Research

[### LMCache (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache?utm_source=tldrai)

LMCache is an open-source KV-cache acceleration layer for LLM serving that stores and reuses transformer key‑value cache chunks (across GPU, CPU, disk, and Redis), enabling 3–10× faster response times and significantly reduced GPU compute under long-context and multi-turn scenarios.

[### Financial Knowledge in LLMs (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13491?utm_source=tldrai)

FinCDM proposes a cognitive diagnosis framework for evaluating financial LLMs at the skill level, moving beyond single-score benchmarks.

[### End-to-End Test-Time Training (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/test-time-training/e2e?utm_source=tldrai)

E2E is a long-context language modeling approach that reframes the task as continual learning. Using standard Transformers with sliding-window attention, the model learns at test time via next-token prediction and meta-learns during training for better initialization.
