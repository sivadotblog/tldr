### Headlines & Launches

[### Apple's robotics work aims to solve user's first-world problems (3 minute read)](https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/08/25/first-world-problems-drives-apples-robotics-development?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple may be expanding into robotics, potentially introducing devices that move, such as an iPad mounted on a robotic arm. Headed by VP of Technology Kevin Lynch, Apple's robotics efforts are progressing with the help of experts from firms like Israel's Technion, and propose to include AI interfaces beyond Siri. While still conceptual, Apple is considering a 2026 or 2027 release for these new robotic products.

[### Cohere Command R Update (12 minute read)](https://cohere.com/blog/command-series-0824?utm_source=tldrai)

Command R and Command R+ received an upgrade on essentially all tasks. They are now better at recall, speed, math, and reasoning.

[### Workers at Google DeepMind Push Company to Drop Military Contracts (5 minute read)](https://time.com/7013685/google-ai-deepmind-military-contracts-israel/?utm_source=tldrai)

Nearly 200 Google DeepMind employees signed a letter urging Google to terminate military contracts, claiming a violation of the company's own AI ethics principles. DeepMind technology has been bundled into Google Cloud and sold to militaries, sparking internal conflict with AI staff who value ethical standards. Google's response demonstrated an adherence to AI Principles, but workers remain unsatisfied, seeking stronger governance against military use of their AI.

### Research & Innovation

[### Auxiliary-Loss-Free load balancing for MoEs (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15664?utm_source=tldrai)

Routing tokens to experts in MoEs helps sparsify the computation. However, learning that routing can be challenging. There is typically a complicated loss structure. This paper shows a novel way to overcome this problem and dramatically improve expert balancing and training stability.

[### Improving Low-Light Video Quality (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14916v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This end-to-end framework simultaneously addresses low-light enhancement and motion deblurring in videos using event cameras.

[### Sound Source Localization (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16448v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have proposed a new audio-visual learning framework for enhancing sound source localization, addressing the issue of false negatives in traditional methods. The framework includes two schemes: Self-Supervised Predictive Learning (SSPL) and Semantic-Aware Contrastive Learning (SACL). SSPL eliminates false negatives by focusing on positive-only learning, while SACL refines the contrastive learning process to improve alignment between audio and visual features.
