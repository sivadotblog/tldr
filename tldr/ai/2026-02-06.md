### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### I spent $10,000 to automate my research at OpenAI with Codex (6 minute read)](https://x.com/kareldoostrlnck/status/2019477361557926281?s=12&utm_source=tldrai)

Many people drastically underestimate what Codex can do. This post shares a simple setup that is routinely allocated hundreds of millions of tokens. The author spent $10,000 on API costs this month. The post also shares some killer use-cases for Codex, and reflects on how organizations might become significantly more efficient in the near future.

[### Mind The GAAP Again (16 minute read)](https://blog.dshr.org/2026/02/mind-gaap-again.html?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI desperately needs cash because it lacks economies of scale. Microsoft is shipping billions to OpenAI because it would be disastrous for the company if OpenAI went under. $10 billion of OpenAI's revenue may have been effectively a subsidy from Microsoft. This means that OpenAI was charging subscribers around 25% of what they were costing. OpenAI would have significantly fewer subscribers with an $80 per month subscription.

[### Building a C compiler with a team of parallel Claudes (13 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler?utm_source=tldrai)

Multiple Claude instances worked in parallel to build a Rust-based C compiler capable of compiling the Linux 6.9 kernel. This approach reduced human supervision and explored autonomous LLM agent capabilities via stress tests and a $20,000, 2,000-session effort. The compiler, while functional, has limitations like inefficient code and reliance on GCC for some features.
