### Research & Innovation

[### Deepdive: Text-To-Video (18 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/text-to-video?utm_source=tldrai)

Generating video from text descriptions is an active area of research with many powerful models coming in the last few weeks. This blog from the Hugging Face team outlines the task, current challenges, and the state of the research. It isn‚Äôt completely comprehensive, but will give a great starting point for further reading.

[### A Model for All Kinds of Image and Video Segmentation (2 minute read)](https://lxtgh.github.io/project/omg_seg/?utm_source=tldrai)

OMG-Seg is a new model that can perform various image and video segmentation tasks using a single efficient system. Unlike traditional methods that use different models for each task, OMG-Seg handles everything from image semantics to interactive video segmentation, making it a one-stop solution with reduced complexity and enhanced performance.

[### Open-Vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09732v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed BriVIS, a method that improves open-vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). By using a technique called Brownian Bridges, BriVIS maintains the context of object movements across video frames, leading to a more accurate alignment between video and text.

[### Image Captioning Software (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ANTONIOPSD/CaptionIMG?utm_source=tldrai)

Simple software that can be used to add captions to your images for AI training.

[### Library for 3D parallelism (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/huggingface/nanotron?utm_source=tldrai)

HuggingFace has released Nanotron, a small and powerful library for training models with 3D parallelism. This means it splits the data, the model, and the layers/tensors in the model. The first two types of parallelism are well supported in libraries like PyTorch. However, splitting the model tensors is custom to each model and hard to implement in general. This library provides useful primitives to make that process easier and less error-prone.

[### Library for data filtering (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/huggingface/datatrove?utm_source=tldrai)

HuggingFace has released Datatrove, a library for filtering large text datasets. It has many useful primitives and full parallel pipelines for text filtering. Examples using Gopher quality filters in C4 are available.

### Miscellaneous

[### How Microsoft found a potential new battery material using AI (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/24027031/microsoft-new-solid-state-battery-material-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have found a new battery material using AI and large-scale cloud computing. The material is a new kind of solid-state electrolyte. It could lead to batteries that are less likely to burst into flames compared to lithium-ion batteries. While the material still needs to be tested to see whether it is a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries, the finding demonstrates AI's potential for speeding up material discovery.

[### Clearer Remote Sensing Images (7 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07849v1?utm_source=tldrai)

RSHazeNet is a new framework designed to remove haze from remote-sensing images. The tool uses innovative modules to better understand and preserve important details in images, making them clearer and more useful for analysis.

[### Boosting Vision Foundation Models (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/tencentarc/visft?utm_source=tldrai)

The new ViSFT method enhances vision foundation models, like those used in image-text training, by applying a two-stage process similar to fine-tuning in language models.
