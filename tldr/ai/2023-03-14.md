### Headlines & Launches

[### Together releases OpenChatKit (6 minute read)](https://www.together.xyz/blog/openchatkit?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenChatKit provides a powerful, open-source base to create both specialized and general purpose chatbots for various applications. OpenChatKit is Together‚Äôs version of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. All of the model‚Äôs weights, code, and training data are available online. And it was even trained on 100% carbon-negative compute.

Grammar-checking tool Grammarly is announcing support for a generative AI tool that can write content in your personal writing style. Launching in the coming months, ‚ÄúGrammarlyGO‚Äù is a generative AI product that is designed to ‚Äúaccelerate productivity where people write.‚Äù Like ChatGPT, GrammarlyGO is able to create text based on a short prompt, though Grammarly‚Äôs special trick is that the content generated copies your usual writing style

[### Alpaca: A Strong Open-Source Instruction-Following Model (8 minute read)](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Instruction-following models such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), ChatGPT, Claude, and Bing Chat have become increasingly powerful. However, instruction-following models still have many deficiencies: they can generate false information, propagate social stereotypes, and produce toxic language. To make maximum progress on addressing these pressing problems, it is important for the academic community to engage. Alpaca is a model fine-tuned from the LLaMA 7B model on 52K instruction-following demonstrations.

### Research & Innovation

[### Jensen's inequality (24 minute read)](https://francisbach.com/jensen-inequality/?utm_source=tldrai)

An extremely useful inequality for applied mathematicians and machine learning practitioners. This post explores this often backwards, but useful, inequality. If you're hoping to learn more of the math behind ML, this is a good piece to read.

[### MVImgNet: A Large-scale Dataset of Multi-view Images (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06042?utm_source=tldrai)

The authors introduce MVImgNet, a large-scale dataset of multi-view images for 3D vision. It contains 6.5 million frames from real-world objects and bridges the gap between 2D and 3D vision. MVPNet, a 3D object point cloud dataset, is also introduced.

[### StyleGANEX: Rescaling StyleGAN with Dilated Convolutions for Robust Unaligned Face Manipulation (Github Repo)](https://github.com/williamyang1991/styleganex?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper proposes a solution to the limitations of StyleGAN, which is restricted to cropped aligned faces at fixed image resolution. The solution involves using dilated convolutions to rescale the receptive fields of shallow layers in StyleGAN without altering model parameters, resulting in features that can accommodate variable resolutions and better characterize unaligned faces. Additionally, the paper introduces an encoder that provides the first-layer feature of the extended StyleGAN and validates the effectiveness of the method in various face manipulation tasks, including super-resolution, facial attribute editing, sketch/mask-to-face translation, and face toonification.

[### The hot mess theory of AI misalignment (11 minute read)](https://sohl-dickstein.github.io/2023/03/09/coherence.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Many machine learning researchers worry about risks from building AI. One popular AI risk centers on AGI misalignment. It posits that we will build a superintelligent, super-capable, AI, but that the AI's objectives will be misspecified and misaligned with human values. If the AI is powerful enough, and pursues its objectives inflexibly enough, then even a subtle misalignment might pose an existential risk to humanity.

[### GPT-4 Upgrade Will Include Text-To-Video (2 minute read)](https://archive.ph/6pEyv?utm_source=tldrai)

According to Microsoft Germany CTO Andreas Braun, OpenAI‚Äôs upcoming GPT-4 upgrade will allow users to turn text into video. Braun added that the more powerful AI will be introduced this week, putting an end to speculation over its release. "We will introduce GPT-4 next week, where we will have multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities ‚Äì for example, videos," Braun said.
