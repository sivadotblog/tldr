Over 20K attendees roamed downtown San Jose for 2025 GTC last week; AI developers learned from [Bria.ai](http://Bria.ai) How to build predictable, controllable, on-brand visual content at scale while respecting artists' rights.

See a few of the key topics they covered:

* [The Future of a Sustainable Economy Around Visual Generative AI is Built on Licensed Data, Not Scraped (a.k.a stolen) Data.](https://go.bria.ai/4hrtulf)
* [Visual AI Cookbooks (GitHub projects) For Visual Generative AI Model Customization](https://go.bria.ai/4hmC58K)

### Research & Innovation

[### NemoTron-H (23 minute read)](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/nemotronh/?utm_source=tldrai)

Nvidia has released a new set of hybrid Mamba style models trained on 20T tokens. They achieve strong performance, especially on long context tasks where they have extreme sequence scaling benefits. This represents the first successful fp8 large scale training of a hybrid attention model.

[### Synthetic Cities (12 minute read)](https://research.paulengstler.com/syncity/?utm_source=tldrai)

SynCity is a novel system that generates detailed 3D worlds from text prompts without any training. It combines a 2D image generator for artistic quality and a 3D generator for accurate geometry, building scenes tile-by-tile and seamlessly blending them into a navigable environment.

[### Large-Scale Outdoor Scene Generation (2 minute read)](https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/NuiScene/?utm_source=tldrai)

NuiScene introduces a new method for generating expansive outdoor environments that utilizes uniform vector-set encoding and explicit outpainting for better compression and faster generation.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model for Single Image to 3D in Seconds (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/aigc3d/LHM?utm_source=tldrai)

Code release for a method that takes a single image as input and creates a fully animatable 3D avatar. It is permissively licensed and seems to work quite well.

[### Tokenize an Image as a Set (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Gengzigang/TokenSet?utm_source=tldrai)

"Tokenize Image as a Set" is a new framework for image generation that uses set-based tokenization and a novel discrete diffusion method. The approach represents images as unordered token sets, enabling a unique and invertible generative modeling process.

[### Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/google-deepmind/latent-multi-hop-reasoning?utm_source=tldrai)

This research investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) perform multi-hop reasoning ‚Äì a process of connecting multiple pieces of knowledge ‚Äì when presented with complex prompts. The study found evidence of this latent reasoning process, particularly in the initial step, but utilization of the connected knowledge varied and showed a scaling trend with model size, suggesting both challenges and opportunities for future LLM development.
