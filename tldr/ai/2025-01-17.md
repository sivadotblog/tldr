[### FAST: Efficient Robot Action Tokenization (12 minute read)](https://www.pi.website/research/fast?utm_source=tldrai)

Physical Intelligence has released the efficient action tokenizer that it uses for the strong auto regressive policy for robotic control. The model allows for a much better representation of states. It uses the same technology as is used in JPEG and MP4 compression techniques.

[### Self-supervised Transformation Learning (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08712v1?utm_source=tldrai)

STL introduces a self-supervised approach to transformation learning by replacing transformation labels with representations derived from image pairs.

[### Iterative Depth Estimation (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08643v1?utm_source=tldrai)

MonSter combines monocular depth estimation and stereo matching in a dual-branch architecture to iteratively refine depth maps. While slightly slower, the method is as much as 49% better than the strong baselines presented in the paper.
