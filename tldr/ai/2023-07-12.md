### Headlines & Launches

[### Anthropic Releases Claude 2 (4 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic has released its newest model, Claude 2. Claude 2 offers improved performance, extended responses, and is accessible via API and a beta site. With enhanced reasoning, coding, and math capabilities, Claude 2 can process up to 100K tokens in each prompt, enabling it to tackle complex technical tasks and generate lengthy documents.

[### bitsandbytes releases 4-bit inference (4 minute read)](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/releases/tag/0.40.0?utm_source=tldrai)

AI models have many parameters which are represented in the computer with decimal numbers. The precision of these numbers determines how precise they are, and how much space they take. If you reduce the precision from 32 bits to 16, you get dramatic speed ups. Now we can go all the way to 4 and get a 4x speed up on some architectures. It is plug-and-play with HuggingFace models.

### Research & Innovation

[### An Improved Method for New Lesion Segmentation (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04513v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The researchers in this study propose CoactSeg, a new framework that improves the segmentation of new lesions in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) by utilizing a mix of data from single and two-time-point scans. By maintaining relationships among the inputs and outputs, and with the aid of a new MS-23v1 dataset, this method significantly improves the performance of identifying both new and all existing lesions in MS patients.

[### Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts (20 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172?utm_source=tldrai)

A recent study on language models revealed a performance drop when locating relevant information in the middle or long portions of the input context. Despite being designed for long-context handling, these models excel primarily at the beginning or end of the context. The findings offer an improved understanding of language model operations and suggest new testing protocols for long-context models.

[### Improving Machine Translation with TIM (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04408v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have created a new method called TIM that teaches language models to better translate text by showing them examples of right and wrong translations. This method, tested on the WMT2022 datasets, has been found to outperform existing techniques.
