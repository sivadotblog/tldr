Spencer Rascoff co-founded Zillow, scaling it into a $16B real estate giant. But everyday investors couldn't invest until after the IPO, missing early gains.

"I wish we had done a round accessible to retail investors prior to Zillow's IPO," Spencer later said.

Now he's doing just that. Spencer teamed up with fellow Zillow exec Austin Allison to launch [Pacaso](https://invest.pacaso.com/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=paid-partnership&utm_campaign=partnership30-520_05-27_10758330809). And they've already surpassed $110M in gross profit and $1B in transactions.

They also recently reserved their Nasdaq ticker PCSO. But unlike Zillow, [you can invest in Pacaso as a private company.](https://invest.pacaso.com/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=paid-partnership&utm_campaign=partnership30-520_05-27_10758330809)
