### Research & Innovation

[### Improving Text-to-Image Generation (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09466v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Turning long texts into images can be tough, especially when there are lots of items or details to show. This new method breaks down long descriptions into simpler steps and makes sure each detail fits perfectly in the picture, setting a new high standard for creating images from text.

[### Making Depth Estimation More Flexible (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09975v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Figuring out 3D depth from a single 2D image is tricky because many 3D scenes can look the same in 2D. This method separates camera details from the picture's content, making it easier to guess the depth in various situations.

[### 6T multilingual tokens (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09400?utm_source=tldrai)

Hot on the heels of Google's new dataset comes CulturaX. A cleaned dataset of trillions of multilingual tokens will be a great boost for multilingual language models.
