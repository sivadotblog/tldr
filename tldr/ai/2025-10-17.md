[### Close the GenAI security readiness gap with this blueprint by Rob T. Lee of SANS (Sponsor)](https://www.sans.org/mlp/ai-security-blueprint?utm_medium=Sponsored_Content&amp;utm_source=TLDR&amp;utm_content=SP_AI_Blueprint_10.17.25&amp;utm_campaign=SP_AI_2025&amp;utm_rdetail=Global&amp;utm_goal=Leads&amp;utm_type=Global_Campaign)

AI adoption is accelerating, but most teams still lack the guidance to secure, govern, and monitor it at scale.

Rob T. Lee, Chief of Research and AI Officer at SANS, developed the Secure AI Blueprint ‚Äî a 3-track model to help organizations protect, utilize, and govern AI responsibly. It's a practical framework built to close the AI security gap.

### Headlines & Launches

[### Claude's Skills (3 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic has unveiled Claude Skills, modular task-specific packages containing instructions, scripts, and resources. These make Claude more effective at specialized tasks by loading relevant context only when needed.

[### OpenAI develops shared ChatGPT prompts feature for Teams (1 minute read)](https://www.testingcatalog.com/openai-develops-shared-chatgpt-prompts-feature-for-teams/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's Prompts feature within team workspaces for ChatGPT appears to be aimed at organizations. It creates a library of shared prompts made by team members accessible across the team. Team members are able to create prompt templates, set custom instructions, and integrate variables. Teams will be able to package up complex, multistep tasks into single prompts using built-in tools.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP (5 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic's new Skills feature consumes only dozens of tokens per skill until needed compared to MCPs that can burn tens of thousands upfront. The design is incredibly simple: drop instructions in a folder and Claude figures out when to use them. This token efficiency and model-agnostic approach (any coding agent can read the files) will trigger a "Cambrian explosion" that makes the MCP rush look pedestrian, especially since skills transform Claude Code from a coding tool into a general automation agent capable of handling anything you could accomplish by typing commands.

[### AI at Work: OpenAI's Workforce Blueprint (10 minute read)](https://cdn.openai.com/global-affairs/f319686f-cf21-4b8e-b8bc-84dd9bbfb999/oai-workforce-blueprint-oct-2025.pdf?utm_source=tldrai)

GPT-5-level models now match human professionals on roughly half of economically valuable tasks, completing work in minutes that would take a human hours. OpenAI has proposed a retraining program targeting 10 million Americans by 2030, acknowledging evidence that AI is already displacing entry-level workers. The company frames AI as "more enabler than replacer" despite proposing a massive retraining initiative, which has historically failed to prevent job displacement from technological change.

Cognition trained specialized models that retrieve code context 10x faster than frontier models by using RL to issue up to 8 parallel tool calls per turn instead of the sequential searches typical agents use. Speed matters more than the industry realizes because it allows developers to stay in a flow state.

[### The Art of Scaling Reinforcement Learning Compute for LLMs (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13786?utm_source=tldrai)

ScaleRL is a framework for analyzing and predicting compute scaling in LLM reinforcement learning. Their large-scale study shows that stable training recipes yield predictable performance curves, aiding efficient resource allocation.

[### Recursive Language Models (35 minute read)](https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/?utm_source=tldrai)

Recursive Language Models (RLMs) can decompose and recursively interact with their input context as a variable. An RLM using GPT-5-mini outperforms GPT-5 with more than double the number of correct answers on OOLONG while being cheaper per query on average. RLMs outperform other methods ReAct + test-time indexing and retrieval over the prompt without any degradation in performance when given over 10 million tokens at inference time. RLMs trained explicitly to recursively reason are likely to be the next milestone in general-purpose inference time scaling.
