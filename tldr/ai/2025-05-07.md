Google has released a preview of Gemini 2.5 Pro, which has a stronger performance in building web apps, code transformation, and multimodal reasoning.

[### Pinterest New Visual Search (2 minute read)](https://newsroom.pinterest.com/news/introducing-new-visual-search-features/?utm_source=tldrai)

Pinterest has upgraded its image-based search with new tools that help users narrow results and explore styles, launching first in the women's fashion category across select regions.

[### Cognition KEVIN-32B (7 minute read)](https://cognition.ai/blog/kevin-32b?utm_source=tldrai)

KEVIN-32B is a model leveraging reinforcement learning for multi-turn code generation that outperforms existing models in developing CUDA kernels. It boosts kernel performance and correctness by optimizing intermediate feedback and using efficient reward distribution. Multi-turn training enhances the model's problem-solving capability over single-turn approaches, particularly in more complex tasks.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### How to train an AI model without falling into GDPR pitfalls? (5 minute read)](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b58d1d9a-4803-468e-90ff-160d26139c5e&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

AI model developers can ensure GDPR compliance during the development phase by using anonymous datasets or applying pseudonymization techniques. If anonymization isn't feasible, they can enhance data security and support data subjects' rights. Transparency measures, such as public communication about data usage, are also recommended.

[### Can AI-Generated Images Truly Be Considered Art? (6 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-art-whitney-museum?utm_source=tldrai)

Christiane Paul, curator at the Whitney Museum, highlights AI's role in digital art, contrasting historical programs like Harold Cohen's AARON with today's AI models. She stresses the importance of collaboration with engineers and the challenges of preserving digital art due to evolving technology. Paul argues that AI-generated visuals need a conceptual framework to be considered true art.
