### Headlines & Launches

[### Meta LLama 3 model planned for July (1 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-plans-launch-new-ai-language-model-llama-3-july-information-reports-2024-02-28/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta's Llama team is reportedly still working on alignment to enable the model to loosen up and answer more queries that aren‚Äôt actually controversial.

[### Modal adds websockets (5 minute read)](https://modal.com/blog/websocket-launch?utm_source=tldrai)

Most serverless GPU offerings require one POST request per model inference. However, this is a challenge in cases where you want to stream model outputs. Websockets make streaming possible.

[### Tim Cook Says Apple Will ‚ÄòBreak New Ground‚Äô In Generative AI (1 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/tim-cook-apple-generative-ai-break-new-ground/?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple CEO Tim Cook announced at the company's annual shareholders meeting that the company plans to break new ground in generative AI in 2024, promising transformative opportunities for users.

### Research & Innovation

[### Enhancing Visual Perception in AI Models (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06783v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This research focuses on advancing multi-modality foundation models like GPT-4V in low-level visual perception tasks. The large-scale experiment gathered feedback on 18,973 images from 58,000 humans and created the Q-Pathway dataset to analyze clarity, color, and brightness.

[### 1Bit LLMs (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764?utm_source=tldrai)

Most language models use 16 or more bits to represent a parameter in a model. This results in powerful models that can be expensive to run. This work proposes a method that uses 1.58 bits per parameter - each parameter is in {-1, 0, 1}. This method matches performance exactly up to 3B parameters. No code or models have been released yet.

[### Video as the New Language for Real-World Decision Making (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17139?utm_source=tldrai)

An amazing paper that frames video as a potentially better way for AI to interact with human users. It shows how video models can be used as planners, agents, compute engines, and environment simulators.

[### LLMs Handle 100K Tokens with Dual Chunk Attention (14 minute read)](https://github.com/hkunlp/chunkllama?utm_source=tldrai)

Dual Chunk Attention (DCA) extends the capabilities of large language models like Llama2 70B, allowing them to handle over 100k tokens without additional training. It breaks down attention computation into chunks, enhancing the model's understanding of both short and long-range context.

[### Distilabel framework for alignment data collection (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel?utm_source=tldrai)

Distilabel is a framework designed for AI engineers that aligns large language models using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)-related methods such as reward models and DPO. It primarily focuses on LLM fine-tuning and adaptation. Distilabel assists with data collection, cleaning, and training.

[### Drug Design with Graph Diffusion Policy Optimization (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/sail-sg/gdpo?utm_source=tldrai)

Graph diffusion policy optimization enhances graph generation models for drug design using a unique reinforcement learning technique. This approach promises better performance in creating complex and diverse graph structures and could set new standards in the field.

[### StarCoder v2 (4 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder2-15b?utm_source=tldrai)

The Big Code project has released another version of its flagship coding model. The model has a 16k context window and was trained on 4T tokens. Its performance is strong, but still under that of DeepSeek coder.

[### Online Shopping with Multi-modal Knowledge Distillation (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17188v1?utm_source=tldrai)

PromptMM improves recommendation systems on platforms like Amazon and TikTok by using Multi-modal Knowledge Distillation. It addresses inaccuracies in user preferences and simplifies systems by distilling important features from various content types (visual, textual, or acoustic) to prevent overfitting.

[### Learning from Heterogeneous Graphs (4 minute read)](https://higpt-hku.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

HiGPT is an approach to learning across diverse heterogeneous graphs without the need for fine-tuning. Its integration with a novel graph tokenizer and a vast corpus of graph instructions allows it to excel in adapting to various data distributions.
