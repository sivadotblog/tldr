### Research & Innovation

[### Language models are bad at moral reasoning (23 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14308?utm_source=tldrai)

Recently, some Silicon Valley big thinkers have argued that AI doesn't pose a significant risk because they claim moral reasoning improves as capabilities improve. This paper provides concrete arguments against that idea, showing that modern language models perform poorly at moral reasoning tasks.

[### FlashAttention-2 (20 minute read)](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/07/17/flash2.html?utm_sourcr=tldrai)

Flash attention came out a year or so ago and has quickly been adopted as the standard way to speed up attention calculations. Now, the second version of this amazing technique is out, with a purported 5-9x improved performance over traditional attention.

[### Learning to retrieve in-context examples (23 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07164?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces a new method for improving how large language models (LLMs) learn. The method uses a system that finds the best examples for LLMs to learn from. It uses feedback from an LLM to train a model, then it uses the model to train a 'retriever' to find good examples. Tests show that the method makes LLMs learn better across many tasks. It even works well on tasks it wasn't trained on and on LLMs of all sizes. The improved learning seems to come from the retriever finding similar examples to learn from.
