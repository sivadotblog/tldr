[### What Happened To OpenAI's Long-Term AI Risk Team? (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/05/what-happened-to-openais-long-term-ai-risk-team/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI dissolved its superalignment team after the departures of co-leads Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike and several other researchers. This team, created to address long-term AI risks, will have its work absorbed by other research efforts.

[### $16k G1 humanoid rises up to smash nuts, twist, and twirl (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/robotics/unitree-g1-humanoid-agent/?utm_source=tldrai)

Unitree has released the first few details on its G1 Humanoid Agent, a $16,000 robotic helper. The robot is equipped with 3D LiDAR sensors, a depth camera, three-fingered grippers, and a 9,000-mAh battery pack. It can recover from brutal kicks and punches, as seen in the short demo video in the article. At around 35 kg, the robot can fold itself down to 690x450x300-mm proportions for compact carry.

[### Open Release of Grok-1 (1 minute read)](https://x.ai/blog/grok-os?utm_source=tldrai)

xAI has released the weights and architecture for Grok-1. Grok-1 is a Mixture-of-Experts model with 314 billion parameters. The released model is a raw base model checkpoint from the Grok-1 pretraining phase, which means that it is not fine-tuned for any specific application. It was trained from scratch by xAI using a custom training stack.

[### LoRA Learns Less and Forgets Less (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09673?utm_source=tldrai)

LoRA is a popular way to fine-tune models to inject style or knowledge. This paper explores the trade off between power and forgetting when using LoRAs. The research finds that LoRAs are able to learn less than full fine tuning, but maintain more of the original ‚Äúout of distribution‚Äù performance.

[### Chameleon Early Fusion Multi-Modal (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09818?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta has announced a natively multi-modal model called Chameleon that operates on images and text simultaneously like GPT-4o. It outperforms many alternative models. The Meta team has since far surpassed this work on internal models.

[### Gemini 1.5 Technical Report (153 page PDF)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf?utm_source=tldrai)

Google's most recent family of models has an updated technical report. There is little information about the models or the data used, but there is significant information about the evaluation and safety measures taken, which is an interesting window into large-scale alignment.
