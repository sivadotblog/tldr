### Research & Innovation

[### gzip is state of the art for out of distribution sentence classification (3 minute read)](https://github.com/bazingagin/npc_gzip?utm_source=tldrai)

When you have sentences representing some information, there are sentences you care about, and sentences that are ‚Äúout of distribution‚Äù from your task. Oftentimes you want to figure out which sentences are anomalies so you can take action. Most methods use a big neural network to embed and classify sentences, but this requires expensive training and data collection. A cool fact is that if you concatenate two sentences and the gzip compression ratio doesn‚Äôt change much, the sentences are likely very similar. This, combined with a parameter free nearest neighbor search, provides a simple and clever algorithm to detect out of distribution sentences.

[### Simple voice conversion with frozen model (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18975?utm_source=tldrai)

[### Measuring global opinions about language (3 minute read)](https://llmglobalvalues.anthropic.com/?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic‚Äôs latest research asks the question, ‚ÄúWhose opinions are the responses of large language models most similar with when considering the perspectives of participants across the world?‚Äù This is important as AI infiltrates our daily life and it may not be equitably representative of humanity's opinions. Interactive visualizations of model output and RLHF steps are available.
