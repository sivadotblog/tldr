[### One-Minute Video Generation with Test-Time Training (12 minute read)](https://test-time-training.github.io/video-dit/?utm_source=tldrai)

This work introduces Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, featuring highly expressive hidden states, to overcome the limitations of standard Transformers and alternatives like Mamba in generating long, coherent videos. By integrating TTT layers into a pre-trained model, they demonstrate the generation of coherent one-minute videos from text storyboards that significantly outperform baseline methods in telling complex stories according to human evaluations. Tom and Jerry cartoons are the test bed.
