Venture capitalists know how difficult it is to spot promising early investment opportunities, and the story of Ring doorbells is the perfect example. Even the all-knowing Sharks from Shark Tank declined the offer to buy 10% of Ring for $700,000, and now the company has blown up, all thanks to retail distribution.

Next, let's turn our attention to RYSE: the brand set to follow a similar trajectory. The founder pitched on Canada's version of Shark Tank, Dragons' Den, [received two offers](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=aion,04-11-2024), and now their patented tech is currently sold in over 100 Best Buy stores.
