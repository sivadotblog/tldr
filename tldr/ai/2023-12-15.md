### Research & Innovation

[### Weak to Strong Generalization (8 minute read)](https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization?utm_source=tldrai)

This new result from the OpenAI super alignment team (with code) suggests that you can use much weaker supervisor models to steer or align a far more powerful model, an analog to weak humans aligning super intelligent models. They used GPT-2 to recover much of the alignment performance of GPT-4. One important point they note is that this method has a tractable path for dramatic improvement, unlike RLHF-like methods.
