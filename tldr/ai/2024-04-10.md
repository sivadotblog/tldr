### Headlines & Launches

[### Google Gemma Expanded Models (7 minute read)](https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/04/gemma-family-expands.html?m=1&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

Google has trained a code Gemma and Recurrent Gemma models. They get competitive performance and include FIM capabilities. The recurrent model is much faster and more memory efficient.

[### Meta Confirms That Llama 3 Is Coming Next Month (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/meta-confirms-that-its-llama-3-open-source-llm-is-coming-in-the-next-month/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta has confirmed plans to release Llama 3, the next generation of its large language model for generative AI assistants, within the next month.

[### Four Takeaways on the Race to Amass Data for A.I. (3 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/06/technology/ai-data-tech-takeaways.html?utm_source=tldrai)

The development of AI, particularly large language models like GPT-3, is heavily reliant on vast amounts of data, with companies like Meta and Google racing to gather more as high-quality online data may run out by 2026. Tech giants are employing controversial methods, including using YouTube data and considering the purchase of publishers, to fuel their AI advancements. The use of 'synthetic' data is a potential solution, though it carries the risk of amplifying AI errors.

### Research & Innovation

[### Enhancing Object Detection in Single-Domain (11 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12133v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Addressing the challenge of single-domain generalization (S-DG) in object detection, the new OA-DG method introduces OA-Mix for data augmentation and OA-Loss for training.

[### Improving Stable Diffusion with Unified Feedback (17 minute read)](https://uni-fl.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

UniFL is a method that improves the output quality of diffusion models using a fairly complicated cascade of feedback steps. These all serve to improve the visual quality, aesthetics, and preference alignment of the image generation models. The techniques are agnostic to the underlying model and can be used to improve any image generation models.

[### Swap Anything (11 minute read)](https://swap-anything.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

SwapAnything is a new algorithm that can replace things in a picture with other things you choose, without changing the rest of the picture. It's better than other tools because it can swap any object, not just the main subject, and it's really good at making the new object fit perfectly into the original picture. It uses inversion, concept vectors, and a pretrained diffusion model.

Despite the success, challenges in integrating AI into tangible products and competition from entities such as OpenAI's ChatGPT persist. Hassabis, recognized for his significant contributions to AI, must now navigate Google's product strategy to leverage DeepMind's research advancements.

[### ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs very easy to steal someone‚Äôs voice‚Äô: how AI is affecting video game actors (10 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/29/how-ai-is-affecting-video-game-actors?utm_source=tldrai)

Cissy Jones, a renowned voice artist, co-founded Morpheme to offer ethical AI voice modeling after her voice was used without consent. Morpheme ensures actors consent and are compensated for AI-generated vocal content. The broader industry's rush to AI adoption may sideline human talent and ignore actors' rights. As the video game industry integrates AI, Sag-Aftra union negotiations aim to protect performers' consent and fair compensation.
