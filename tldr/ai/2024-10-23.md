[### The Second $100B AI Company (9 minute read)](https://www.digitalnative.tech/p/the-second-100b-ai-company?utm_source=tldrai)

This article predicts that by 2034, new AI companies driven by advancements in AI applications, especially in consumer AI, will join OpenAI in surpassing a $100B market cap. Despite the current dominance of established tech giants in the AI infrastructure and model layers, the application layer remains ripe for innovation and growth, presenting opportunities for consumer AI to thrive. The potential for large-scale success in consumer AI, particularly in areas like video creation, online shopping, and gaming, mirrors previous tech revolutions in cloud and mobile sectors.

[### Introducing the prompt() Function: Use the Power of LLMs with SQL! (5 minute read)](https://motherduck.com/blog/sql-llm-prompt-function-gpt-models/?utm_source=tldrai)

The costs of running LLMs have significantly decreased, enabling the practical integration of small models like gpt-4o-mini into SQL functions. MotherDuck's PROMPT() function allows for streamlined text generation, summarization, and structured data extraction using OpenAI models. It offers flexibility in cost and performance and supports bulk operations with enhanced concurrency for efficient processing.

[### Use Prolog to improve LLM's reasoning (3 minute read)](https://shchegrikovich.substack.com/p/use-prolog-to-improve-llms-reasoning?utm_source=tldrai)

Current techniques like CoT and incorporating programming languages like Prolog can enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, addressing the limitations of autoregressive models. The "Reliable Reasoning Beyond Natural Language" paper introduces a neurosymbolic method that uses Prolog to convert requests into symbolic logic, improving explainability and problem-solving. ProSLM has demonstrated significant improvements on datasets, showing promising results for integrating Prolog with LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.
