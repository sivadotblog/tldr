### Headlines & Launches

[### Meta Movie Gen (6 minute read)](https://ai.meta.com/research/movie-gen/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta has trained a state-of-the-art movie model. It has 30B parameters and took 6,144 H100s to train. The model was trained on 1B images and 100m highly curated videos. Interestingly, it is a Temporal Autoencoder and Flow matching Llama. Meta released a 92 page paper, one of the most detailed research reports on the topic.

[### FinLLM Leaderboard (6 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-finbench?utm_source=tldrai)

The Open FinLLM Leaderboard offers a specialized evaluation platform tailored for financial language models. It focuses on tasks crucial for finance, such as stock movement prediction, sentiment analysis, and information extraction from financial reports.

### Research & Innovation

[### Embers of Autoregression for o1 (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01792?utm_source=tldrai)

Large language models have limitations due to next token prediction. However, OpenAI's o1 model was trained with a new objective over reasoning traces. Despite this change, o1 still shows signs of limitations due to next token prediction.

[### Contextual Document Embeddings (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02525?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper describes a method that is almost like a neutral TF/IDF in that it takes information from the entire corpus instead of just a single embedding document. It essentially encodes contextual information about neighboring documents. This method is state-of-the-art on MTEB.

[### ENTP: Encoder-only Next Token Prediction (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01600?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper shows a novel design architecture for using encoder-only transformers as next token prediction models. This has been done in other ways before, but the researchers find a great way to prevent cheating. The models have hints of strong performance at scale and also are capable of in-context learning.
