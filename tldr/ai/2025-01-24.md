### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI Operator (8 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/?utm_source=tldrai)

Operator is a newly released AI agent capable of performing tasks on the web by interacting with browsers, handling actions such as typing, clicking, and scrolling. Powered by the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, it uses GPT-4's vision capabilities and reinforcement learning to navigate graphical interfaces and execute user-defined tasks, such as filling forms or ordering groceries.

[### Anthropic Introduces Citations API (3 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-citations-api?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic's new Citations API helps AI models generate responses with detailed and verifiable citations, increasing the trustworthiness of outputs.

[### Luma AI releases Ray2 (3 minute read)](https://lumalabs.ai/ray?utm_source=tldrai)

Ray2 is a large-scale video generative model that's setting a new standard in realistic visuals with natural, coherent motion and logical event sequences. It was trained on Luma's new multi-modal architecture, scaled to 10x compute of Ray1. Ray2 is initially available to paid subscribers in Dream Machine with 5 second text-to-video generations.

[### Snowflake claims breakthrough can cut AI inferencing times by more than 50% (4 minute read)](https://siliconangle.com/2025/01/16/snowflake-claims-breakthrough-can-cut-ai-inferencing-times-50?utm_source=tldrai)

Snowflake has integrated SwiftKV, a technique from its AI Research, to optimize LLM inference, improving throughput by 50% and reducing costs by up to 75% for some Llama models. SwiftKV enhances efficiency by recycling hidden states in LLM layers, reducing memory usage and computational overhead without significant loss of accuracy. The technique will be available in other models within Snowflake's Cortex AI, boosting performance in tasks like summarization and real-time AI applications.

[### Virtuoso Small Beats Phi 4 (5 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/arcee-ai/Virtuoso-Small?utm_source=tldrai)

Virtuoso has the same number of weights as the newly released Phi model, scores strongly in benchmarks, and also seems slightly more useful in real world tasks where the synthetic data of Phi can fall over.

[### What features are coming next to the Gemini app? (5 minute read)](https://9to5google.com/2025/01/16/gemini-app-features/?utm_source=tldrai)
