[Pacaso](https://invest.pacaso.com/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=paid-partnership&utm_campaign=partnership30-520_08-06_10758330809) has built a tech platform that simplifies co-ownership of vacation homes ‚Äî a market worth $1.3 trillion.

Their model has:

* 41% YoY gross profit growth.
* $110M+ in gross profit to date.
* $1B+ in processed transactions and fees.
* [Just announced further expansion](https://invest.pacaso.com/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=paid-partnership&utm_campaign=partnership30-520_08-06_10758330809) into Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico.

This is a rare SEC-qualified public offering where retail investors can buy early-stage shares alongside the same VCs that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay.

The Nasdaq ticker PCSO is already reserved. Global expansion is happening now.

Ready to get on board? [Invest at $2.90/share](https://invest.pacaso.com/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=paid-partnership&utm_campaign=partnership30-520_08-06_10758330809)

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Building the #1 open source terminal-use agent using Letta (5 minute read)](https://www.letta.com/blog/terminal-bench?utm_source=tldrai)

Letta built an open source agent for terminal use that ranked 4th overall on Terminal-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents on real-world command-line tasks focused on real-world complexity. The startup provides a stateful agents API layer that is compatible with any model and provides tools for managing the context window over time. Its terminal-use agent uses Letta's built-in capabilities for context management and memory, specifically memory blocks. Agent developers can use Letta to rapidly specialize agents for specific tasks.

[### Strong Winds, Big Sails: Why Cline Wins (4 minute read)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mbn82eYa9lOFTHiW9s6vriwookSPYDmOEy1zOEdhXC4/edit?tab=t.0&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

Cline's model-agnostic architecture lets it ride two powerful tailwinds‚Äîbetter models and cheaper inference‚Äîrather than fighting frontier progress. The open-source coding assistant uses transparent pass-through pricing, automatically giving users the best available performance without margin-padding that plagues subscription competitors.

MetaStone AI released XBai o4, its fourth-generation open-source model, which now outperforms OpenAI-o3-mini in Medium mode. The model focuses on complex reasoning tasks and introduces a scalable, parallel test-time inference framework.

[### Code Index MCP (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/johnhuang316/code-index-mcp?utm_source=tldrai)

Code Index MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that helps large language models index, search, and analyze code repositories with minimal setup. It transforms how AI understands codebases with advanced search, analysis, and navigation capabilities. Code Index MCP is perfect for code review, refactoring, documentation generation, debugging assistance, and architectural analysis. It has support for a range of mainstream languages, mobile development platforms, web frontends, databases, and systems.

[### Feature Correlations and Memory Capacity in DAMs (4 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01395?utm_source=tldrai)

Structured input data affects the memory capacity of Dense Associative Memory models. Using datasets with varying feature correlation and Hamming distance, the study finds that while separation increases capacity exponentially, correlated features slightly reduce it.

[### Introducing AI Grounding with Brave Search API, providing enhanced search performance in AI applications (11 minute read)](https://brave.com/blog/ai-grounding/?utm_source=tldrai)

Brave has launched AI Grounding with the Brave Search API, an all-in-one solution for connecting AI system outputs to verifiable data sources. AI Grounding anchors responses from large language models to factual information from verifiable web sources, reducing hallucinations and increasing appropriate responses to nuanced inputs.
