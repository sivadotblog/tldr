### Headlines & Launches

[### Retool State of AI Report (35 minute read)](https://retool.com/reports/state-of-ai-2023?utm_source=tldrai)

Retool's State of AI report, which surveyed 1,500 tech workers, reveals generative AI's growing impact on business. MongoDB Atlas Vector Search leads in popularity among vector databases, vital for AI-powered apps enhancing productivity and customer experiences. However, challenges in AI adoption persist, notably in model accuracy and data security, with C-suite executives showing greater optimism than individual contributors.

[### You.com Launches New APIs To Connect LLMs To The Web (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/you-com-launches-new-apis-to-connect-llms-to-the-web/?utm_source=tldrai)

You.com has launched APIs starting at $100 per month, enabling large language models like Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 to access up-to-date internet data and offering enhanced answer accuracy through web search and news functionalities.

[### Microsoft and OpenAI partnership unveils new AI opportunities (3 minute read)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2023/11/07/come-build-with-us-microsoft-and-openai-partnership-unveils-new-ai-opportunities?utm_source=tldrai)

At OpenAI‚Äôs DevDay, Microsoft announced plans to offer the new GPT-4 Turbo on Azure OpenAI Service by year-end, providing enhanced control and efficiencies at lower costs. OpenAI's Custom Models program will seamlessly integrate with Microsoft's ecosystem, boosting enterprises‚Äô AI capabilities.

### Research & Innovation

[### Powerful Nous fine-tune of the 34B Yi model (HuggingFace Hub)](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Capybara-34B?utm_source=tldrai)

Nous research has released a very strong 34B model built on top of the bilingual Yi model. Capybara is trained primarily on multi-turn data with more than 1000 tokens per conversation, which makes it uniquely positioned for certain user-facing tasks with high information density.

[### LLM Decontaminaor (18 minute read)](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-11-14-llm-decontaminator/?utm_source=tldrai)

When new models come out with astounding capabilities, it is natural to question whether they actually trained on the validation data or on benchmarks. Decontamination is the process of removing such testing data from the input. The LMSYS group found that if you rephrase test data in a way that passes decontamination but still contains information about the benchmark, you can fake your way to amazing performance.

[### MonoDiffusion: Depth Estimation Without Ground-Truth (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07198v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study introduces MonoDiffusion, a novel framework for self-supervised monocular depth estimation, which uniquely approaches the challenge as an iterative denoising process. It utilizes a pseudo ground-truth diffusion process guided by a pre-trained teacher model to improve depth map accuracy without using actual depth ground-truth in training.
