[### Learning to Fly (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/arplaboratory/learning-to-fly?utm_source=tldrai)

A repository for training end-to-end control policies using deep reinforcement learning. The training is done in simulation and is finished within seconds on a consumer-grade laptop. The trained policies generalize and can be deployed on real quadrotors.

[### Guiding Instruction-based Image Editing via Multimodal Large Language Models (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/apple/ml-mgie?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple released code that uses multimodal language models to improve human-provided natural language edits to images.

[### Lag-Llama: Towards Foundation Models for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/time-series-foundation-models/lag-llama?utm_source=tldrai)

Lag-Llama introduces a breakthrough in time series forecasting with a transformer-based model that excels in zero-shot and few-shot generalization, pre-trained on a broad spectrum of time series data. It surpasses existing deep learning methods in state-of-the-art performance through fine-tuning on minimal data, marking a significant advancement in foundation models for time series analysis.

[### Packing for LLM training (6 minute read)](https://github.com/MeetKai/functionary/tree/main/functionary/train/packing?utm_source=tldrai)

Packing in training models is a way to improve training efficiently by concatenating examples. If done incorrectly, contamination can occur between examples because the attention doesn‚Äôt know where to stop. The community has found that EOS is often sufficient, but there still can be problems. This repository provides an implementation in Hugging Face for common models to properly pack input data.

[### Massed Muddler Intelligence (19 minute read)](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/massed-muddler-intelligence?utm_source=tldrai)

The concept of Massed Muddler Intelligence (MMI) represents a shift from traditional monolithic AI scaling towards a model based on distributed, agent-based systems that learn and adapt in real time. Grounded in principles of embodiment, boundary intelligence, temporality, and personhood, MMI advocates for AI development that emphasizes scalable, interactive agents with a degree of autonomy and mutual governance, moving away from the current focus on accumulating larger datasets and computational resources.

[### AI Could Actually Help Rebuild The Middle Class (16 minute read)](https://www.noemamag.com/how-ai-could-help-rebuild-the-middle-class/?utm_source=tldrai)

Elon Musk and Geoffrey Hinton's views on AI as a job-eliminating force contrast with the reality that the industrialized world faces a labor shortage exacerbated by demographic trends, suggesting a future where work is plentiful but the nature of expertise and employment will evolve. AI, rather than making human jobs obsolete, offers the potential to democratize and extend expertise, enabling a broader workforce to engage in high-stakes decision-making and restoring a middle-skill, middle-class job market hollowed out by automation and globalization.
