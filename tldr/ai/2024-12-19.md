### Research & Innovation

[### Alignment Faking in Large Language Models (12 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/alignment-faking?utm_source=tldrai)

Interesting research from Anthropic and Redwood that explores what models do if they know they are being aligned. Interestingly, they show alignment while still maintaining their original preferences. This is helpful to show holes in existing alignment methods.

[### Factorizing Transformers for Linear Time Inference (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11477v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces a new transformer design that achieves linear time complexity during inference by factorizing the attention mechanism, reducing computational costs while maintaining model performance.

[### Are your LLMs Capable of Stable Reasoning? (31 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13147?utm_source=tldrai)

Reasoning is a huge opportunity for models, especially for critical applications like real world deployment. However, benchmarks that are meant to test reasoning ability don't show how stable a model is across novel tasks. This paper introduces a new benchmark called G-Pass@k which evaluates a model's peak and stable reasoning ability.
