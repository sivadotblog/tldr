### Engineering & Resources

[### Complex Function Benchmarks for LLMs (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/thudm/complexfuncbench?utm_source=tldrai)

This repository contains benchmarks and tools for assessing AI models on complex function calls.

[### LLMs with Fewer Parameters (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/joaopauloschuler/less-parameters-llm?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers demonstrate that LLMs can maintain learning capacity while reducing non-embedding parameters by up to 77%. By replacing dense layers with optimized subnetworks, they achieve comparable performance with significantly fewer resources.

[### Better Reasoning with Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/scitix/MEAP?utm_source=tldrai)

MEAP integrates Masked Language Modeling into Next-Token Prediction using a decoder-only Transformer. By masking a small fraction of input tokens, it improves information retrieval tasks while maintaining reasoning capabilities.

### Miscellaneous

[### Why AI Is A Philosophical Rupture (41 minute read)](https://www.noemamag.com/why-ai-is-a-philosophical-rupture/?utm_source=tldrai)

Tobias Rees argues that generative AI challenges long-standing human-machine distinctions, presenting new forms of intelligence that require philosophical reconsideration. AI's ability to operate beyond traditional comprehension models suggests its potential to transform human cognition and self-awareness. Rees advocates for philosophical engagement in AI development to explore and navigate this new terrain of human-AI symbiosis.

[### Billionaires talk automating jobs away (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/this-week-in-ai-billionaires-talk-automating-jobs-away/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is collaborating with SoftBank to automate white-collar workflows using AI, sparking concerns about large-scale unemployment. OpenAI also launched a new AI agent for research and the o3-mini reasoning model, while the EU implemented a ban on risky AI systems. Additionally, ByteDance's YuE model generates music from prompts, and Anthropic introduces Constitutional Classifiers to enhance AI safety measures.

[### EU puts out guidance on uses of AI that are banned under its AI Act (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/eu-puts-out-guidance-on-uses-of-ai-that-are-banned-under-its-ai-act/?utm_source=tldrai)

The EU's AI Act compliance deadline has passed, prompting the Commission to release guidance for developers on adhering to new AI regulations. Breaches of prohibited use cases, such as social scoring, could incur severe penalties. The guidelines aim to provide clarity but are not legally binding. Formal adoption is pending translation.
