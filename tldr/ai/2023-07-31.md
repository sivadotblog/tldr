### Research & Innovation

[### Language models learn skills to learn language (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14430?utm_source=tldrai)

As part of the effort to figure out what language models do when pre-training, you can set up synthetic data tasks to test various skills and then curate data sets that contain data that helps inform those skills. If you train on 1 billion tokens, you can get the same performance as training on 3 billion tokens with a properly curated data set.

[### Google's new breakthrough in robotics (6 minute read)](http://robotics-transformer2.github.io?utm_source=tldrai)

Transformers used to see, Transformers used to plan, and Transformers used to control? It seems like Transformers are continuing to eat the world with this next iteration of robotics efforts from Google that use the powerful pre-trained models to improve various aspects of the robots performance.

[### AI Can Now Learn from a Simulated Environment (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14993v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The Thinker algorithm introduces a unique method allowing artificial intelligence to independently interact with and learn from a simulated environment, improving their ability to make strategic plans. Tested in the game of Sokoban and Atari 2600 benchmark, the algorithm displays top-tier performance, offering a new approach for reinforcement learning in AI and revolutionizing how planning is integrated into the decision-making process.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Text Generation Interface (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference?utm_source=tldrai)

A Rust, Python, and gRPC server for text generation inference. Used in production at HuggingFace to power Hugging Chat, the Inference API, and Inference Endpoint. Recently changed license to no longer be commercially usable.

[### Better Medical Imaging Through Self-Supervised Learning (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14725v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The study introduces vox2vec, an innovative approach that uses self-supervised learning to better understand medical imagery like CT scans on a voxel (3D pixel) level. The results show that vox2vec excels compared to other techniques in the field, offering a more efficient solution that requires fewer trainable parameters.

[### Google's Bard and the Challenge of Visual Understanding (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/htqin/googlebard-visunderstand?utm_source=tldrai)

Google's conversational AI, Bard, now has the capability to process visual inputs in addition to text, creating new possibilities for multi-modal generative models. However, this study across 13 diverse visual scenarios reveals that Bard struggles with visual understanding, showing considerable room for improvement in future development of AI models.

A report by McKinsey on how AI will fuel work in certain occupations and erode growth in others.

[### The AI Education Issue That Nobody Detected (6 minute read)](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/the-ai-generated-education-issue?utm_source=tldrai)

Teachers who want to stem the tide of AI cheating will have to look somewhere besides AI writing detectors as it is clear at this point that detectors are not effective.

[### The Paradox Of AI And Data Roles (2 minute read)](https://tomtunguz.com/why-data-teams-will-grow-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Tomasz Tunguz explains why, even though AI will automate some data work, it will also demand much more from data teams.

[### Llama 2 7B 32k context length (6 minute read)](https://together.ai/blog/llama-2-7b-32k?utm_source=tldrai)

Together compute, which recently raised $20 million, has fine-tuned Llama 2 with a linear extension on the positional embeddings to work up to 32k tokens in context. They tested on a number of interesting benchmarks, but cautioned that " forgetting the middle" is still very much a problem in modern day language models.
