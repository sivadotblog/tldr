[### OpenAI's $1 Trillion Infrastructure Spend (17 minute read)](https://tomtunguz.com/openai-hardware-spending-2025-2035/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has committed to spending $1.15 trillion on hardware and cloud infrastructure between 2025 and 2035. The estimated annual spending and commitments convey an absolutely enormous level of potential and ambition. OpenAI will need to grow from around $10 billion in 2024 revenue to $577 billion by 2029. This article takes a look at the numbers.

[### The state of AI in 2025: Agents, innovation, and transformation (21 minute read)](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai#/?utm_source=tldrai)

Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting phase. High performers use AI to drive growth, innovation, and cost. Redesigning workflows is a key success factor. The potential impact of AI on employment is still debated - 43% of workers in a survey expected no change in the overall size of the workforce in their organizations in the coming year.

[### Introducing Nested Learning: A new ML paradigm for continual learning (7 minute read)](https://research.google/blog/introducing-nested-learning-a-new-ml-paradigm-for-continual-learning/?utm_source=tldrai)

Continual learning, the ability to acquire new knowledge without forgetting old information, remains a major obstacle to AGI since current models suffer from “catastrophic forgetting,” where learning new tasks diminishes proficiency on previous ones. A proof-of-concept architecture called Hope, a self-modifying model that optimizes its own memory, outperformed modern recurrent models and transformers on language modeling and excelled particularly at long-context needle-in-a-haystack tasks.

[### Claude Code Infrastructure Showcase (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/diet103/claude-code-infrastructure-showcase?utm_source=tldrai)

This repository contains a curated reference library of production-tested Claude Code infrastructure. It contains production-tested infrastructure for auto-activating skills via locks, specialized agents for complex tasks, and more. Using this infrastructure, skills will suggest themselves based on context, hooks will trigger skills at the right time, modular skills stay under context limits, dev docs preserve knowledge across resets, and agents will streamline complex tasks.

[### Quantization is not a compromise — it's the next paradigm (3 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1987125624599970218.html?utm_source=tldrai)

K2-Thinking's release has led many developers to be curious about its native INT4 quantization format. INT4 accelerates RL training due to its low-latency profile. Quantization is no longer a tradeoff. Native low-bit quantization will become a standard paradigm for large model training with the evolution of param-scaling and test-time-scaling.

Companies are pouring billions of dollars into cutting-edge computing facilities. The sheer scale of spending is causing investors to be concerned. Tech giants are turning to financing maneuvers that may add to the risk. Hyperscalers are leveraging a growing list of complex debt-financing options, including corporate set, securitization markets, private financing, and off-balance-sheet vehicles.

[### OpenAI: AI progress and recommendations (5 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/ai-progress-and-recommendations/?utm_source=tldrai)

The gap between everyday use of AI and its core capabilities is massive. Chatbots are used to write emails or replace web searches, while the underlying models outperform human experts in math and coding competitions. OpenAI is advocating for light regulation now to cement its market position before the next leap in capability. Once systems become transformative enough to warrant a coordinated national response, there will be a shift to federal oversight that overrides state-level restrictions.
