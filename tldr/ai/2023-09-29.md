[### Billionaires wanted it, but 54,578 everyday investors got it first... and profited (Sponsor)](https://www.masterworks.com?utm_source=tldrai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=9-29-23&amp;utm_term=TLDR+AI+subscriber&amp;utm_content=billionaires+54578+)

When incredibly valuable assets come up for sale, it's typically the wealthiest that end up taking home an amazing investment. But not always...

One platform is taking on the billionaires at their own game, fractionalizing prized blue-chip artworks for its investors. In just the last few years, its investors have realized annualized net [returns of 17.8%, 21.5%, 35%](https://www.masterworks.com?utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=9-29-23&utm_term=TLDR+AI+subscriber&utm_content=billionaires+54578+) and more.

It's called [Masterworks](https://www.masterworks.com?utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=9-29-23&utm_term=TLDR+AI+subscriber&utm_content=billionaires+54578+). When Masterworks sells a painting ‚Äì like the 16 it's already sold ‚Äì investors reap their portion of the profits.

We all know SaaS is going to be impacted by AI but the question is what is the next wave going to look like? This in-depth discussion with Kristina Shen goes into why it‚Äôs more about insights than information and unlocking the real power of AI for SaaS.

[### New Forethought tool lets you build workflows with natural language (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/new-forethought-tool-lets-you-build-workflows-with-natural-language/?utm_source=tldrai)

Forethought unveils "Autoflows", a new AI-driven system for customer service tasks that goes beyond simple Q&A. Using natural language prompts, Autoflows determines steps and tasks across systems, differing from traditional no-code workflows. Powered by SupportGPT, which is based on OpenAI models, the system blends automation and human oversight.

### Research & Innovation

[### Meta's text to image model (6 minute read)](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/emu-enhancing-image-generation-models-using-photogenic-needles-in-a-haystack/?utm_source=tldrai)

Pre-trained on 1.1B image pairs and fine-tuned on just a few thousand highly curated images, Emu image generation outperforms SDXL in user preference surveys. It acts as the backbone to much of Meta‚Äôs new AI assistant play.

[### Simplifying VQ-VAE (30 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15505?utm_source=tldrai)

VectorQuantized-VAEs are typically the state of the art when trying to learn a specific discrete representation (e.g., tokens or codes). However, they are usually complex and fragile. This new paper proposes a simple quantization scheme that eliminates codebook collapse and complicated machinery such as commitment losses, codebook reseeding, code splitting, entropy penalties, etc.

[### Jointly training large multimodal models (23 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15564?utm_source=tldrai)

Models are usually trained separately on specific tasks (e.g., language vs image generation). The newly proposed joint autoregressive mixture (JAM) algorithm combines disparate models with a clever interleaved cross attention and gentle fine-tuning achieves dominant performance in many multimodal tasks.
