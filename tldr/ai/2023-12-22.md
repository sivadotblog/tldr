### Research & Innovation

[### PowerInfer for LLMs on Consumer GPUS (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12456?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper explores the idea that models have hot neurons used for almost all inputs and cold neurons that are used much less often. By preloading the hot neurons to the GPU, you can save memory without sacrificing much throughput. A companion code library is available.

[### Image Generation with Sequence-Aware Loss (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12431v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a 'sequence-aware' loss function to improve Denoising Probabilistic Models (DPMs), addressing the issue of timestep correlation in image generation. This new approach not only offers a tighter estimation of loss but also shows significant improvements in image quality on datasets like CIFAR10 and CelebA, as evidenced by better FID and Inception Scores.

[### UltraFast 3D reconstruction from a single image (4 minute read)](https://szymanowiczs.github.io/splatter-image?utm_source=tldrai)

Gaussian Splatting has pushed 3D reconstruction forward. However, it often requires 200+ images of an object for accurate reconstruction. This work moves to a single monocular image and a learning-based technique that maps each pixel of the image into a 3d gaussian. The cool novel piece here is the introduction of the ‚ÄúSplatter Image,‚Äù which encodes 3D information for downstream rendering.
