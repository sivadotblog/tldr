### Headlines & Launches

[### Viral AI-powered Drake and The Weeknd song is removed from streaming services (4 minute read)](https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/viral-ai-powered-drake-weeknd-song-removed-streaming-services-rcna80098?utm_source=tldrai)

An AI-voiced rap song imitating the voices of Drake and The Weeknd was removed from streaming services due to a copyright claim by Universal Music Group (UMG). The anonymous musician, ghostwriter, used AI to create the vocals for the song "heart on my sleeve." UMG recently urged streaming platforms to ban AI programs from using copyrighted music for training purposes. Media lawyer Edward Klaris explained that the song potentially infringes on the artists' right of publicity, but the legality of using copyrighted songs to train AI models remains uncertain.

[### Artist rejects photo prize after AI-generated image wins award (5 minute read)](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/ai-photo-win-sony-scli-intl/index.html?utm_source=tldrai)

German artist Boris Eldagsen rejected an award from the Sony World Photography Award after revealing that his submission, "Pseudomnesia: The Electrician," was generated by AI. Eldagsen hoped that his actions would prompt a conversation around AI-generated images and encourage separate competitions for such works. The World Photography Organisation, which runs the competition, stated that they recognized the importance of AI and its impact on image-making but emphasized that the awards would continue to focus on championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium.

[### New Adobe Lightroom AI innovations empower everyone to edit like a pro (4 minute read)](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/04/18/new-adobe-lightroom-ai-innovations-empower-everyone-edit-like-pro?utm_source=tldrai)

Adobe has introduced new AI-powered features for its Lightroom ecosystem, including Denoise and Curves in masking, enabling users to make highly customized and precise edits to their photos. Additionally, adaptive presets and expanded masking categories for Select People are available, along with Black & white for video and AI masking and adaptive presets on the web, making it easier for everyone to edit photos like a pro and bring their creative visions to life.

### Research & Innovation

[### Learning to Compress Prompts with Gist Tokens (7 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08467?utm_source=tldrai)

A new technique called "gisting" has been introduced as a way to utilize multitask capabilities of language models without requiring prompts or model retraining for each task. Gisting compresses prompts into smaller sets of tokens that can be reused, resulting in computational efficiency, FLOP reductions, and speedups without significant loss in output quality. This technique was tested on two LMs, achieving up to 26x compression of prompts and up to 40% FLOPs reductions.

[### DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection (7 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08069?utm_source=tldrai)

A new real-time end-to-end object detector called Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR) has been proposed to address the high computational cost issue of end-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs), which limits their practical application. RT-DETR uses an efficient hybrid encoder, IoU-aware query selection, and supports flexible adjustment of inference speed without retraining. RT-DETR achieves up to 54.8% AP on COCO val2017 and 74 FPS on T4 GPU, outperforming YOLO detectors and DINO-Deformable-DETR-R50 in both speed and accuracy.

### Engineering & Resources

[### OctoML: On-demand compute to run generative AI models in production (Sponsor)](https://octoml.ai/cp/model-serving-compute-access/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter)

OctoML is building a compute layer that's as [easy as OpenAI but flexible to run on any cloud](https://octoml.ai/cp/model-serving-compute-access/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter). The goal is to make developing apps with the latest generative AI models simple: pick your model, spin up a model serving API, and run an inference endpoint on the most cost-efficient compute.

[### Street Fighter AI (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/linyiLYi/street-fighter-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

There has been recent work in making RL agents less afraid. One paper specifically talks about mitigating cowardice in models trained in RL. This is interesting in the realm of self-driving cars and terrifying in other potential applications. This repository shows how we can now train RL agents to win in a fighting game. The full training and evaluation code is available.

Window AI is a browser extension that lets you configure AI models in one place and use them on the web.

[### Camel (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/lightaime/camel?utm_source=tldrai)

Camel explores the potential of building scalable techniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and provide insight into their "cognitive" processes.

[### Auto Evaluator (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/PineappleExpress808/auto-evaluator?utm_source=tldrai)

There is a task in ML called ‚ÄúQuestion Answering‚Äù which tries to automate the processes of responding to questions with proper answers. There are certain things that make this challenging such as determining factuality or handling rephrasings. This tool uses a language model to automate the generation and answering of questions. This follows the trend in language models today where it is easier for them to verify that something is correct rather than generate the correct thing.

[### How to use ChatGPT in your PM work (5 minute read)](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-use-chatgpt-in-your-pm-work?utm_source=tldrai)

Product managers are increasingly incorporating AI tools like ChatGPT into their work. In the future, learning to work alongside AI will become essential for knowledge work, as evidenced by tools like Grammarly for writing and Copilot for engineers. ChatGPT can be integrated into various aspects of product management, including summarizing user feedback and data, suggesting product names, and strengthening arguments by identifying critical questions, gaps, and hidden assumptions. As AI continues to develop, working with these tools will become increasingly important for professionals in the field.
