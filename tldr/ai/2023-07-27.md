### Headlines & Launches

[### Transformers for Audio free course (8 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter0/introduction?utm_sourfe=tldrai)

Generating things with Transformers is all the rage - but it's hard to get started and even harder to know where to look. This great new course from HuggingFace shows how to work with audio data and train Transformers.

[### Frontier model forum (4 minute read)](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-microsoft-openai-anthropic-frontier-model-forum/?utm_source=tldrai)

If you thought it was hard to keep up with all the new models being released, the different forums being launched for safety and alignment take the cake. Another group consisting of a selection of top labs training large models has been formed to oversee safety and alignment of large models.

[### OpenAI is hiring a lot of lawyers (6 minute read)](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2023/07/19/openais-lawyer-hiring-spree-drawing-from-tech-elite/?slreturn=20230626183254&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

There are a myriad of legal challenges to solve in the new generative AI world. Many top lawyers from big tech companies are moving to OpenAI to work on these novel problems.

### Research & Innovation

[### Enhance Anti-Money Laundering Systems with Graph Neural Networks (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13499v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study proposes a new method for detecting money laundering activities using Graph Neural Networks designed to work on large, varied networks constructed from real-world bank transactions.

[### Use language models without compromising your prompts (25 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.12533?utm_source=tldrai)

Many recent advances in language models are behind gated APIs. This means that you have to send sensitive data to the model provider to use their service. However, there are algorithms called multiparty communication that enable secure communication without leaks. They are, naturally, expensive to run. In this study, it took about 5 minutes to generate 1 token for Llama 7B, but it was the first time it actually worked!

[### Improving Medical Image Analysis with Swin Transformers (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ucsc-vlaa/swinmm?utm_source=tldrai)

This repository introduces SwinMM, a new method that improves the analysis of medical images by efficiently using information from multiple viewpoints in a self-supervised way, even when there's not much training data available.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Detecting Factual Errors in Text Generated by AI (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/gair-nlp/factool?utm_source=tldrai)

This repository introduces FacTool, a new framework designed to spot factual errors in text created by large language models regardless of the task or domain.

[### An Enhanced Approach for Referring Video Object Segmentation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/bo-miao/sgmg?utm_source=tldrai)

This repository introduces SgMg, a new method that improves the process of segmenting referred objects in videos by addressing an issue with feature drift and making use of visual details to better optimize the segmentation. The new approach also enables simultaneous segmentation of multiple objects in a video, making the process faster and more practical.

[### Neural networks help understand neural waves (8 minute read)](https://github.com/akandykeller/NeuralWaveMachines?utm_source=tldrai)

Human brains produce neural waves, but their exact function is unknown. By training sequence models to use dynamics known to produce similar waves, researchers found that these waves may help our brain have memory and computation happen at once.

[### Japan's METI to build new supercomputer to help develop AI at home (2 minute read)](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-s-METI-to-build-new-supercomputer-to-help-develop-AI-at-home?utm_source=tldrai)

Japan's METI plans to deploy a high-performance supercomputer through AIST to boost local generative AI development. The machine, which offers 2.5x more computational power than AIST‚Äôs existing machine, will be accessible to domestic companies via a cloud service, aiding in economic security and reducing foreign AI reliance.

AI has long played a role in games. From procedurally generated environments, to machine learning and NPC behavior. Generative AI is the next frontier in game development, enabling hyper personalization and adaptive environments. How about a game that designs itself and never ends?

[### Is GPT-4 getting worse over time? (8 minute read)](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/is-gpt-4-getting-worse-over-time?utm_source=tldrai)

A recent paper suggesting performance degradation in GPT-4 has been disputed, attributing the perceived decline to fine-tuning-induced behavioral changes rather than capability loss. The study emphasizes the challenge of quantitatively evaluating language models due to these fine-tuning variances.
