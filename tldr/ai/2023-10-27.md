### Research & Innovation

[### Evaluating GPT-4V's Optical Character Recognition Abilities (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16809v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The paper examines how well GPT-4V, a Large Multimodal Model, performs in various Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks, from reading scenes and handwritten texts to understanding complex document structures.

[### Image diffusion model trained on open data (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16825?utm_source=tldrai)

Most popular diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have been trained on a wide variety of data, but much of that data is subject to different copyright restrictions. This new model from MosaicML is trained purely on Creative Commons data and achieves similar performance to SD 2 while requiring only a fraction of the training data.

[### 4-bit Quantization in LLMs (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16836v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This research introduces LLM-FP4, a novel method to compress large language models by converting their weights and actions to 4-bit floating-point values after training.
