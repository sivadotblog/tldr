Cohere and Accenture are collaborating to bring cohere embedding technology to more than 9,000 enterprise clients.

[### Inflection 2.5 (8 minute read)](https://inflection.ai/inflection-2-5?utm_source=tldrai)

Inflection has launched a new model to power its personal assistant, Pi. The model performs within 94% of GPT-4 with impressive reasoning scores on benchmarks. Inflection claims it only took 40% of the compute to train relative to GPT-4. An interesting insight from this post is that the average conversation with Pi lasts 33 minutes.

[### Answer AI‚Äôs new open source fine-tuning tool (6 minute read)](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-03-06-fsdp-qlora.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Answer AI has released a new FSDP/QLoRA training tool that makes it possible to train 70B parameter models on consumer GPUs. It has open sourced the code and made it easy to run locally or on runpod.

### Research & Innovation

[### tinyBenchmarks: evaluating LLMs with fewer examples (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14992?utm_source=tldrai)

Evaluating language models is typically done with hand-curated benchmarks. Some of these benchmarks are quite large, with some at over 14k examples, which leads to high expense and noise in evaluation. This work shows that you can reliably evaluate language model performance with as few as 100 examples from popular benchmarks.

[### Deep dive: training models at scale (45 minute read)](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/scaling/JAX/overview.html?utm_source=tldrai)

A great tutorial on the different types of parallelism for training large models at scale.

[### Sora, Groq, and Virtual Reality (6 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2024/sora-groq-and-virtual-reality/?utm_source=tldrai)

A few years ago, the concept of the metaverse seemed like it was just fiction from Ernest Cline's book, and Facebook's metaverse push seemed ill-fated. Today, things feel different. Sora generates complex video scenarios and Groq's deterministic chips reduce machine-learning algorithms for faster processing. Together, the convergence of these advancements pushes us closer to achieving real-time video simulation and true virtual reality.

There is an almost 10x difference in speed between different implementations of the popular multi-headed attention module used in modern LLMs. This notebook shows a few and benchmarks their performance.

[### AI is like Water: Necessary, Ubiquitous, and so Similar (5 minute read)](https://www.nfx.com/post/ai-like-water?utm_source=tldrai)

Technology alone is no longer enough to provide a competitive advantage for GenAI companies. This makes GenAI and bottled water similar, as the underlying product is essentially the same. The key differentiators must come from factors such as user experience, distribution, perceived value to customers, branding, and marketing.
