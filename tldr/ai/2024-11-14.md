[### Venice: Private and Uncensored AI (Sponsor)](https://venice.ai/?utm_source=TLDRAI&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=Primary_placement_20percentoff_&amp;utm_term=Nov1424)

Before AI even had a chance to take off, it was taken over by groups that wished to control it - with policies, permissions, privacy-violating user tracking, and censored responses.

[Venice](https://venice.ai/?utm_source=TLDRAI&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_campaign=Primary_placement_20percentoff_&utm_term=Nov1424) is different.

Just like ChatGPT or Claude, Venice lets you search for information, have conversations, analyze documents, and create images and art.

However:

‚úÖ Venice doesn't spy on you

‚úÖ Venice doesn't censor AI responses

‚úÖ Venice lets you choose which open source model you want to use, and edit the System Prompt.
