[### The File System Is the New Database: How I Built a Personal OS for AI Agents (21 minute read)](https://x.com/koylanai/status/2025286163641118915?s=12&utm_source=tldrai)

Personal Brain OS is a file-based personal operating system that lives inside a Git repository designed to stop agents from forgetting important context information. It contains everything the AI assistant needs to recreate users' voice, brand, goals, content pipeline, research, and more. This article discusses how Personal Brain OS was built, why the architectural decisions matter, and the lessons the developer learned the hard way. The full architecture is available for anyone to clone and make their own.

[### Why Developers Keep Choosing Claude Over Every Other AI (6 minute read)](https://www.bhusalmanish.com.np/blog/posts/why-claude-wins-coding.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Developers keep choosing Claude Code because the alternatives keep failing them in the same way. Generating correct code is a major part of the job, but it isn't everything. Agents still need to edit files without corrupting the surrounding code, read the right files before making changes, complete multistep tasks without losing threads halfway through, know when to ask questions, and more, something no other coding agent does consistently. Claude Code stays on track more than other tools, making it the preferred choice.

[### The Coding Agent Is Dead (3 minute read)](https://ampcode.com/news/the-coding-agent-is-dead?utm_source=tldrai)

The current generation of coding agents isn't the future. The newest models can be powerful with nearly any tool thrown at them, with bash often being enough. Codebase organization is now the bottleneck. Amp plans to kill the Amp editor extensions for VS Code and Cursor on March 5. It will continue to work on the Amp CLI, which is flexible, light, easy to change, and can be run anywhere at anytime.

[### OpenAI First Proof Submissions (4 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/first-proof-submissions/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI detailed its end-to-end proof attempts on all ten First Proof research problems, a domain-specific challenge designed to test whether AI systems can produce fully checkable mathematical arguments. The post outlined evaluation feedback from field experts, revisions to earlier correctness claims, and included a preprint with all proofs plus an appendix documenting prompt patterns used to simulate iterative human–model collaboration.

[### AlphaEvolve Discovers New Multi-Agent Learning Algorithms (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16928?utm_source=tldrai)

Using an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models, the work automatically generated new algorithms for imperfect-information games across CFR and PSRO paradigms. The discovered VAD-CFR and SHOR-PSRO variants introduced adaptive discounting and hybrid optimistic meta-solvers, showing improved empirical convergence over strong baselines.
