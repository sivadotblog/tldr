üëã Say hi to Bland, [the world's most realistic AI phone-calling agent](https://www.bland.ai/?utm_campaign=TLDRAINov&utm_medium=paid&utm_source=TLDRhome)

Chances are, you've already spoken to it without even noticing... It can:

üó£Ô∏è Respond in any voice or language.

ü¶æ It's already handling 1M+ phone calls simultaneously - 24/7 - for some of the world's largest businesses.

For [enterprises](https://app.bland.ai/enterprise?utm_campaign=TLDRAINov&utm_medium=paid&utm_source=TLDRForm), it's been a financial game changer across sales, operations, customer support, you name it. It's like the perfect employee.

Pretty wild, huh? Here, [give it a call yourself](https://www.bland.ai/?utm_campaign=TLDRAINov&utm_medium=paid&utm_source=TLDRhome).

### Research & Innovation

[### Motion Prompting (6 minute read)](https://motion-prompting.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

Motion Prompting is a method that trains a video generation model with novel input types. Instead of just text or an image, it uses text, first image frame, and a tracking field of pixels. This then allows for novel control at inference time where it can provide a new pixel field (e.g., for an object moving in a new direction) and generate a video based on that. The method is extremely compelling, but not open sourced.

[### Genie 2: A large-scale foundation world model (9 minute read)](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/?utm_source=tldrai)

Genie 2 is a large scale latent diffusion model for world generation. It works with character control as input and is also classifier free. The outputs are stunning and maintain control and consistency over time.

[### A Comprehensive Survey for Remote Sensing VLMs (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/chen-yang-liu/awesome-rs-temporal-vlm?utm_source=tldrai)

This repository offers a comprehensive survey for remote sensing with the integration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

### Engineering & Resources

[### Free Process Rewards without Process Labels (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/lifan-yuan/ImplicitPRM?utm_source=tldrai)

Process reward models (PRMs) offer finer-grained feedback by evaluating reasoning trajectories step-by-step, unlike outcome reward models (ORMs), which assess entire responses. However, training PRMs requires detailed intermediate annotations, posing significant challenges. This paper shows that an implicit PRM can be derived at no additional cost by training an ORM on response-level labels using log-likelihood ratios of policy and reference models, enabling optimization without requiring specific loss objectives.

[### Dynamic 4-bit Quantization (18 minute read)](https://unsloth.ai/blog/dynamic-4bit?utm_source=tldrai)

The Unsloth team aims to shrink a 20GB language model into 5GB without sacrificing accuracy. There are many algorithms that attempt this, but there are a number of challenges around outliers and compressibility. Llama is a famously hard model to quantize. The method selectively avoids quantizing certain parameters, which greatly improves overall accuracy.

[### Tackling Repetitive Image Generation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/lzhxmu/accdiffusion_v2?utm_source=tldrai)

AccDiffusion v2 improves diffusion models for generating higher-resolution images without training, addressing challenges like object repetition and local distortion.

### Miscellaneous

[### Certain names make ChatGPT grind to a halt, and we know why (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/certain-names-make-chatgpt-grind-to-a-halt-and-we-know-why/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's ChatGPT employs hard-coded filters to prevent the AI from generating false statements about specific individuals, leading to broken conversations when these names are mentioned. This approach stems from past incidents like defamation lawsuits against OpenAI, prompting the company to restrict outputs related to contentious names. The hard-coded filters can pose challenges as they limit ChatGPT's functionality and leave the system vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

[### Finetuning LLM Judges for Evaluation (52 minute read)](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/finetuned-judge?utm_source=tldrai)

Evaluating LLMs has become challenging due to their complex and open-ended outputs. Traditional evaluation relies on human judgment, which is detailed but inefficient. Thus, automatic metrics and model-based evaluations like LLM-as-a-Judge are crucial for scalable assessment. Innovations such as specialized fine tuned judges (e.g., Prometheus) and synthetic data generation are enhancing LLM evaluation's precision and adaptability across diverse tasks and domains.

[### Optimizing AI inference at Character AI (18 minute read)](https://research.character.ai/optimizing-ai-inference-at-character-ai-part-deux/?utm_source=tldrai)

Character AI has a strong inference pipeline. In this post, the team walks through their int8 quantization and flash attention 3 implementation. It's a good read for folks interested in serving large language models at scale.
