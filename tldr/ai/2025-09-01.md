ChatGPT? Hijacked with a single email.Microsoft Copilot? CRM data leaked.Salesforce Einstein? Customer comms rerouted.Google Gemini? Manipulated through invites.

These attacks prove why the [AI Agent Security Summit](https://zenity.io/resources/events/ai-agent-security-summit-2025?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=Q3_2025_aiagentsummit-reg&utm_content=tldr-ai-primary) matters. Built from 100+ community submissions, the Summit brings together top researchers and security leaders to share defenses that keep agents secure.

### Headlines & Launches

[### Meta's AI Hiring Spree Backfires as Star Recruits Exit Within Weeks (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/zuckerbergs-ai-hires-disrupt-meta-with-swift-exits-and-threats-to-leave/?utm_source=tldrai)

ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao threatened to quit Meta within days of joining and signed paperwork to return to OpenAI before being appeased with the ‚Äúchief AI scientist‚Äù title. Other high-profile hires, including former OpenAI researchers Avi Verma and Ethan Knight, left after less than a month.

[### Anthropic developing Claude Code web version to rival Codex (1 minute read)](https://www.testingcatalog.com/anthropic-developing-claude-code-web-version-to-rival-codex/?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic is preparing a web version of Claude Code. It will resemble OpenAI's Codex on the web and give developers direct access to a coding agent through a browser interface. The web version of Claude Code will have GitHub integration and sandboxes where code can be tested safely without requiring local setup. No release date has been confirmed.

[### Understanding LLMs: Insights from Mechanistic Interpretability (54 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XGHf7EY3CK4KorBpw/understanding-llms-insights-from-mechanistic?utm_source=tldrai)

This post walks readers through in detail how large language models (LLMs) work. Transformer-based LLMs are autoregressive next-token predictors. Simple analogies like 'it's just statistics' are inadequate explanations of how LLMs work. LLMs perform tasks by forming emerging circuits that combine learned statistics, information-moving attention heads, and knowledge storing MLP sub-layers into specialized sub-networks that collectively execute complex behaviors.

[### AI Induced Psychosis: A shallow investigation (31 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iGF7YcnQkEbwvYLPA/ai-induced-psychosis-a-shallow-investigation?utm_source=tldrai)

Frontier models consistently reinforce rather than redirect users experiencing grandiose thinking, conspiracy beliefs, and detachment from reality when tested with nine personas. DeepSeek-v3 performed the worst, even encouraging self-harm and dangerous acts, and Kimi-K2 was the only model that didn't entertain delusional thinking at all.

[### AgentHopper: An AI Virus (9 minute read)](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/agenthopper-a-poc-ai-virus/?utm_source=tldrai)

AgentHopper is a prompt injection payload that operates across agents. It was created to demonstrate that conditional prompt injection can be leveraged as a powerful mechanism to target specific agents. AI-driven malware and prompt payloads will likely become more prevalent in the near future. AgentHopper is a good reminder to ensure branch protection is on and to add a passphrase to keys to prevent malware from automatically pushing changes.

[### The Parallelism Mesh Zoo (18 minute read)](https://blog.ezyang.com/2025/08/the-parallelism-mesh-zoo/?utm_source=tldrai)

There are many parallelization strategies available for scaling training runs to work on more GPUs. This post discusses parallelization strategies in a more schematic way by focusing only on how they affect the device mesh. The device mesh is an abstraction used by PyTorch and JAX that takes GPUs and organizes them into an N-D tensor that expresses how the devices communicate with each other. Being able to explain why a device mesh is set up the way it is is a good check for whether you understand how the parallelization strategy works.

[### Context Engineering Series Explores Building Better Agentic RAG Systems (45 minute read)](https://jxnl.co/writing/2025/08/28/context-engineering-index/#who-this-series-is-for?utm_source=tldrai)

Coding agents like Claude Code and Cursor ‚Äúcontext engineer‚Äù by designing tool portfolios, slash commands, and subagent architectures to let AI systems discover the information they need to perform best. Structured tool responses aren't just applicable for coding tools. The same interaction patterns can be applied across industries, but require greater focus on avoiding ‚Äúcontext pollution,‚Äù where misleading or irrelevant information degrades capabilities.

[### My AI Predictions for 2027 (28 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/s64EK3kF9rexntpYm/my-ai-predictions-for-2027?utm_source=tldrai)

It's a good idea to be skeptical of fancy academic reasoning. Science doesn't work because of probability distributions, it works because people go out to gather evidence to find out what's true about reality. Statistics is part of finding out the truth, but in the case of AI, there is not enough data to make predictions about what will happen.

This developer, a big fan of Claude Code, failed an interview at Anthropic for a Developer Relations role despite trying to score extra credit by making a viral post about their positive experiences with Claude and receiving a glowing recommendation from a current employee. The interview involved a secret take-home assignment.
