### Headlines & Launches

[### Introducing Claude Opus 4.5 (6 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5?utm_source=tldrai)

Claude Opus 4.5 is the first model to exceed 80% on SWE-bench Verified. It achieves state-of-the-art results across coding, tool use, and reasoning benchmarks. The model is priced at $5/$25 per million tokens, down from previous Opus pricing. It includes a new "effort" parameter letting developers trade speed for capability, automatic context compression enabling unlimited conversation length, and expanded availability for Claude for Chrome and Claude for Excel.

[### Introducing shopping research in ChatGPT (4 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-shopping-research/?utm_source=tldrai)

Just in time for the holidays, OpenAI launched an interactive product discovery feature that searches the web, asks clarifying questions, and generates personalized buyer's guides. Users can guide research in real-time by marking products "Not interested" or "More like this." The system draws on ChatGPT memory for personalization. It's powered by a GPT-5 mini model trained specifically on shopping tasks.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Nano Banana-pilled, Nano Banana-shilled for Spaceship Engineering (5 minute read)](https://angadh.com/inkhaven-23?utm_source=tldrai)

Nano Banana Pro can make good diagrams based on papers. It can also make pretty good presentations, even on the free tier. This post presents some examples of what happens when you feed the model essays on spaceship engineering. While the facts within the slides still need to be verified, it is clear that the technology is trending towards something impressive - it can only get better from here.

[### A tsunami of COGS (7 minute read)](https://betterthanrandom.substack.com/p/a-tsunami-of-cogs?utm_source=tldrai)

The AI industry is in correction mode. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cursor are subsidizing demand with negative margins. Google was surprised by the AI boom, and it took a while for it to get its act together, but it is now coming back strong. Its pockets are full, and it is better positioned to play the negative margin game. If challengers don't want to drown in a tsunami of costs, something has to change.

[### Universal LLM Memory Does Not Exist (7 minute read)](https://fastpaca.com/blog/memory-isnt-one-thing?utm_source=tldrai)

Semantic memory tracks preferences, long-term history, and rapport. Working memory tracks file paths, variable names, and immediate error logs. Semantic memory is brilliant for personalization across sessions, but bad for execution state within a task. Treat semantic memory and working memory as separate systems with separate requirements.

[### Introducing advanced tool use on the Claude Developer Platform (14 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic released three beta features for developers. Tool Search Tool discovers tools on demand rather than loading all definitions upfront, reducing token consumption by 85%. Programmatic Tool Calling lets Claude orchestrate multiple tools through Python code instead of individual API calls, cutting token usage 37%. Tool Use Examples provides concrete usage patterns beyond JSON schemas, improving accuracy from 72%-90% on complex parameter handling.

[### Building an AI-Native Engineering Team (20 minute read)](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/build-ai-native-engineering-team/?utm_source=tldrai)

AI coding agents are revolutionizing the software development lifecycle by managing tasks from scoping and prototyping to implementation and operational triage, allowing engineers to focus on architecture and product intent. These agents now sustain multi-hour reasoning, effectively contributing across planning, design, development, testing, code reviews, and deployment. Teams that adopt coding agents for well-defined tasks can achieve faster delivery and improved efficiency without drastically altering existing workflows.

[### Taking Jaggedness Seriously (25 minute read)](https://helentoner.substack.com/p/taking-jaggedness-seriously?utm_source=tldrai)

Uneven capability advances in AI will persist because some tasks have clear, verifiable rewards that can be used in reinforcement learning, but most real work doesn't. Most work requires gathering and synthesizing information across different systems and human relationships. Organizations redesigning workflows around AI's strongest current capabilities will gain power over those waiting for the industry's promised "drop-in remote worker" that can handle everything.

[### AI Meets Aggressive Accounting at Meta's Gigantic New Data Center (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-ai-data-center-finances-d3a6b464?st=CrBhT5&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrai)

Meta is building a $27 billion data center financed with debt. Neither the data center nor the debt will be on its own balance sheet. Meta will rent the data center for up to 20 years, beginning in 2029, starting with a four-year lease term with options to renew every four years. The lease structure minimizes the lease liabilities and related assets that Meta will recognize.
