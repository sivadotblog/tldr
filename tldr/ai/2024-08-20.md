### Headlines & Launches

[### Eric Schmidt's AI prophecy (4 minute read)](https://www.exponentialview.co/p/eric-schmidts-ai-prophecy?utm_source=tldrai)

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt predicts rapid advancements in AI, with potential to create significant apps like TikTok competitors in minutes within the next few years. He highlights the unpredictability and swift progress in AI, where large language models and agent-based systems with text-to-action capabilities could converge, causing tremendous economic and technological disruption. Schmidt's view reflects the substantial investments and energy requirements anticipated for leading-edge AI development, signaling a transformative period ahead.

[### Waymo is developing a roomier robotaxi with less-expensive tech (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/19/waymo-generation-6-robotaxi-geely-zeekr.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Waymo has unveiled its Generation 6 self-driving technology, which requires fewer cameras and sensors, integrated into Geely Zeekr EVs. The Alphabet unit plans to rapidly deploy this tech, leveraging machine learning and semiconductor advancements to withstand diverse weather conditions. This update supports Waymo's scaling efforts for its Waymo One service, which is currently providing 50,000 weekly trips.

[### Gemini Live could use some more rehearsals (8 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/19/gemini-live-could-use-some-more-rehearsals?utm_source=tldrai)

Gemini Live, Google's AI-powered voice interaction system, mimics natural conversation but struggles with hallucinations and inaccuracies. Despite incorporating professional actors for more expressive voices, it lacks the customizability and expressiveness found in competitors like OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode. Overall, the bot's reliability issues and limited functionality make its practicality and purpose unclear, particularly as part of Google's paid AI Premium Plan.

[### How to get from high school math to cutting-edge ML/AI (17 minute read)](https://www.justinmath.com/how-to-get-from-high-school-math-to-cutting-edge-ml-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Software professionals seeking to understand advanced ML/AI papers can follow a four-stage learning roadmap: 1) Foundational math (algebra, calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics), 2) Classical machine learning (basic regression, classification models), 3) Deep learning (multi-layer neural networks), and 4) Cutting-edge ML (Transformers, LLMs, diffusion models). Essential resources include author-created content for stages 1-2 and recommended external materials for stages 3-4. Mastery of each stage progressively equips learners to tackle complex ML papers and stay current with evolving AI research.

[### Why Neuralink's Blindsight and brain implants to restore sight won't work like human eyesight (4 minute read)](https://www.fastcompany.com/91168537/neuralink-blindsight-brain-implants-human-eyesight?utm_source=tldrai)

This research highlights the challenges of restoring vision with AI-powered cortical implants, emphasizing that neurons in the visual cortex do not function like pixels on a screen. While high-resolution simulations show potential, achieving natural vision through cortical implants requires replicating complex neuronal patterns, a task far beyond current capabilities, leading to grainy and imperfect outcomes.
