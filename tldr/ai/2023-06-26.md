### Headlines & Launches

[### Google Releases AudioPaLM (7 minute read)](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/audiopalm/examples/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google has introduced AudioPaLM, a large language model for speech understanding and generation. AudioPaLM fuses text-based and speech-based language models into a unified multimodal architecture that can process and generate text and speech, with applications including speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation.

[### Microsoft advances state of the art for LLM training and serving (7 minute read)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/deepspeed-zero-a-leap-in-speed-for-llm-and-chat-model-training-with-4x-less-communication/?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepSpeed is an algorithm and system that has been used to train some of the largest open models. With improvements to memory, throughput, and usability, it just got an upgrade. DeepSpeed is a standard piece of the toolkit for most developers working in AI.

[### Midjourney Update Wows AI Artists (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/stunning-midjourney-update-wows-ai-artists-with-camera-like-feature/?utm_source=tldrai)

Midjourney unveiled version 5.2 of its AI-powered image synthesis model, which includes a new "zoom out" feature that allows maintaining a central synthesized image while automatically building out a larger scene around it, simulating zooming out with a camera lens.

[### SoftGPT: Teaching Robots to Handle Delicate Things (7 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12677v1?utm_source=tldrai)

SoftGPT is a model that helps robots learn to handle soft, changeable objects (like clothes or pillows) which are often found in homes, a task that's usually tricky for robots. This model, trained with lots of exploration data, enables robots to understand object shape and movement and predict the outcome of actions.

[### Disentanglement is back for image editing (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13078?utm_source=tldrai)

Learning disentangled representation was an exciting area of research in computer vision. Large scale contrastive methods like CLIP took the wind out of those sales for a while. However, now, with open source diffusion models, we can use the power of text tokens to disentangle objects in an image and allow for single image editing for AI generated images.

[### Can modern code models self repair? (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09896?utm_source=tldrai)

Program synthesis is the process of writing computer code automatically. Most of the best models like GPT-4, Turbo, WizardCoder, and StarCoder are great at writing code. However, many models fail to repair their own code when it is wrong. This paper measures self repair ability and finds that GPT-4 is one of the only models that exhibits self repair. My guess is this was explicitly trained for by OpenAI and not emergent.

[### A Tool to Spot Fake News (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ni9elf/3han?utm_source=tldrai)

3HAN is a new tool created to help spot fake news. It takes an article and breaks it down into its words, sentences, and headline, paying extra attention to the most important parts when creating a "news vector" or representation of the article. 3HAN has proven to be very effective at detecting fake news and can even highlight the key parts of an article for further human fact-checking.

[### The Bigger-Is-Better Approach To AI Is Running Out Of Road (4 minute read)](https://archive.ph/XwWTi?utm_source=tldrai)

The traditional approach to AI, which involves building ever-larger models, is reaching its limits due to the high cost of training and deploying these models. As a result, researchers are now turning their attention to making AI models more efficient, rather than simply bigger. This could lead to a new era of AI development, where models are able to achieve superhuman performance without requiring massive amounts of resources.

[### AI And The Burden Of Knowledge (10 minute read)](https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/ai-and-the-burden-of-knowledge?utm_source=tldrai)

AI is fundamentally changing the way we think about knowledge. In the past, knowledge was scarce and difficult to acquire. However, AI is making it possible to access and process vast amounts of information quickly and easily. This is leading to a new "burden of knowledge," where we are expected to know more and more about a wider range of topics.
