[### 2025 Mid-Year LLM Market Update: Foundation Model Landscape + Economics (10 minute read)](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-mid-year-llm-market-update/?utm_source=tldrai)

Foundation models are shaping the future of computing. Model API spending has more than doubled in six months. Enterprises are increasing production inference rather than just model development, marking a shift from previous years. Code generation has become AI's first breakout use case. While open source continues to advance, Western labs have seen a slowdown in frontier breakthroughs, resulting in enterprise dollars consolidating around a few high-performing, closed-source models.

[### Learning the Bitter Lesson (5 minute read)](https://rlancemartin.github.io/2025/07/30/bitter_lesson/?utm_source=tldrai)

The design philosophy for building AI applications is still in its infancy. One thing we can predict is that models will get much better. Designing AI applications to take advantage of this is probably the most important thing. It's important to understand your application structure, re-evaluate that structure as models improve, and make it easy to remove structure.
