[### New research by Google: gen AI hits 98% enterprise adoption, but data quality and security concerns linger (Sponsor)](https://cloud.google.com/resources/content/state-of-ai-infrastructure?utm_source=cloud_sfdc&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=FY24-Q3-GLOBAL-ENDM467-website-dl-AIInfraTrends-8889&amp;utm_content=state_of_ai_infra_&amp;utm_term=tldr-ai-primary)

Google Cloud's [survey of 500+ global technology leaders](https://cloud.google.com/resources/content/state-of-ai-infrastructure?utm_source=cloud_sfdc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=FY24-Q3-GLOBAL-ENDM467-website-dl-AIInfraTrends-8889&utm_content=state_of_ai_infra_&utm_term=tldr-ai-primary) validates what everyone is feeling: generative AI is now mainstream (sorry AI hipsters), and it's present at the vast majority of larger organizations.

However, not all is smooth sailing, and many are still figuring out the best way to build an AI-ready cloud that's robust, secure, and cost-effective.

The [2025 State of AI Infrastructure report](https://cloud.google.com/resources/content/state-of-ai-infrastructure?utm_source=cloud_sfdc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=FY24-Q3-GLOBAL-ENDM467-website-dl-AIInfraTrends-8889&utm_content=state_of_ai_infra_&utm_term=tldr-ai-primary) offers a glimpse into how enterprises are preparing for the next tidal wave of AI adoption.

### Headlines & Launches

[### Introducing Codex (3 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI just launched Codex, an autonomous coding agent that writes features, fixes bugs, and submits pull requests in isolated cloud environments. Companies like Cisco and Temporal are already using it to handle entire codebases while their engineers focus on higher-level work. The agent can tackle multiple tasks simultaneously, run tests, and provide detailed citations of every change it makes.

[### Anthropic Receives $2.5 Billion, Five-year Credit Line from Wall Street (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/05/16/anthropic-ai-credit-facility.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic has secured a new line of credit to further accelerate its growth, adding to the $18.2 billion already raised from investors. The company reported that its annualized revenue doubled to $2 billion in the last 6 months. The move mirrors OpenAI's strategy, which established a $4 billion revolving credit line last October.

[### Trump Opens AI Chip Floodgates to Middle East After Reversing Biden-Era Restrictions (2 minute read)](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/18/trump-gulf-ai-deals-saudi-uae-security-china-risk?utm_source=tldrai)

President Trump's Middle East trip has yielded massive AI deals, including Nvidia shipping 18,000 Blackwell chips to Saudi Arabia and plans for the largest non-US AI data center in Abu Dhabi. Critics warn these partnerships could enable China to access restricted US AI technology through its extensive economic ties with Gulf states prompting new bipartisan legislation to prevent such transfers.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Large Language Models Are More Persuasive Than Incentivized Human Persuaders (35 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09662?utm_source=tldrai)

Claude 3.5 Sonnet significantly outperformed human persuaders in a controlled experiment where both attempted to influence participants' answers on quiz questions. Claude achieved 7.6% higher success rates when trying to convince participants to select specific answers and was more effective both at promoting correct answers (+12.2%) and incorrect answers (-15.1%).

[### Superhuman Coders in AI 2027 (9 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QdaMzqaBJi6kupKtD/superhuman-coding-in-ai-2027-not-so-fast?utm_source=tldrai)

Superhuman coding by AI will likely occur by 2033, later than AI Futures' estimates of 2028-2030. This delay is due to factors like handling engineering complexity, working without feedback loops, and achieving cost and speed. Unforeseen challenges, such as geopolitical issues or changes in lab priorities, could further push out timelines.

[### How Hardware Limitations Have, and Will, Prevent Rapid AI Takeoffs (8 minute read)](https://epochai.substack.com/p/how-fast-can-algorithms-advance-capabilities?utm_source=tldrai)

Major algorithmic breakthroughs for LLMs, like the transformer architecture, multi-query attention, and mixture-of-experts systems, only demonstrate substantial benefits (10-50x performance gains) when implemented with massive amounts of compute. This challenges predictions of rapid AI self-improvement since hardware constraints like chip export controls, power consumption limits, and cooling infrastructure bottlenecks would significantly limit any "intelligence explosion" scenario.
