### Headlines & Launches

[### Anthropic scales to 100k context tokens (2 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/index/100k-context-windows?utm_source=tldrai)

Following the trend, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude model can now operate over a dramatically longer context. This means your org can put full documents into the model and the language model will operate on them. They give an example of feeding 240 pages of coding docs into Claude and having it answer coding questions. The technical details of this change are not shared.

[### Stability AI text to animation (2 minute read)](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-animation-sdk?utm_source=tldrai)

SDK released to allow users to create animations using stable diffusion models. You can generate these animations unconditionally, conditioned in an image, or conditioned on a video. The results are lovely, are somewhat computationally expensive, and have a very distinctive style.

[### Bard Updates (5 minute read)](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-bard-updates-io-2023/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google's Bard, a collaborative tool powered by generative AI, is set to become even more versatile. Since its launch, Bard has been enhanced with the PaLM 2 large language model, improving its math and coding skills. Now, Google is making Bard available in over 180 countries and in Japanese and Korean, with 40 languages expected soon. The platform will soon support more visual responses, including image prompts, and incorporate Google Lens capabilities. Developers can also look forward to precise source citations, a dark theme, an "export" button, and more integration with Google's apps and services, as well as third-party platforms like Adobe Firefly.

### Research & Innovation

[### An In-Depth Look at Text-to-3D: The New Frontier in Generative AI (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06131?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper is a comprehensive survey of the emerging field of text-to-3D, a part of generative AI that turns written descriptions into 3D models. It introduces different types of 3D data, foundational technologies, and how they're combined in recent works, as well as how text-to-3D is used in various applications like creating avatars and generating scenes.

[### Creating Better Video Content Using AI and Sketches (5 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05845?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper describes a new way to make video content using artificial intelligence (AI), based on sketches and text. The method, which combines two technologies called Text-to-Video Zero and ControlNet, can create high-quality, consistent videos that closely match what the user intended, as demonstrated by various experiments.

[### Diffusion-based 3D Facial Reconstruction from a Single Image (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06077?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces a method that uses diffusion models, which have been successful in creating images, to reconstruct 3D facial features from just one image. The process involves using a dataset of facial textures, simulating various lighting conditions, and then using the diffusion model to fill in missing parts of the texture and unknown reflective properties, resulting in a more accurate and consistent 3D face.

Former Google senior program manager, Yiƒüit Ihlamur, founded Vela Partners, an AI-powered, product-led VC firm aiming to accelerate innovation. Vela's approach blends AI and expert heuristics to identify trends, source opportunities, and detect threats to its investments. Despite issues of bias in AI, which have been flagged as potential problems in the VC space, Ihlamur maintains that understanding underlying behaviors in the venture market is key. The firm differentiates itself with a "game-like" terminal to aid entrepreneurs and partners, and a public GitHub repo housing its algorithmic models.
