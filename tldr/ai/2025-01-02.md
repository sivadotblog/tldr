### Engineering & Resources

[### XModel-LM (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/XiaoduoAILab/XmodelLM?utm_source=tldrai)

Xmodel-LM is a compact and efficient 1.1B language model pre-trained on around 2 trillion tokens. Trained on a self-built dataset (Xdata), which balances Chinese and English corpora based on downstream task optimization, Xmodel-LM exhibits remarkable performance despite its smaller size. It notably surpasses existing open-source language models of similar scale.

[### SAE Interpretability tool (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/mwatkins1970/SAE_Feature_Interpretability_Tool?utm_source=tldrai)

Automatically figuring out what Sparse Autoencoder features mean can be challenging. This tool aims to help with some clever clustering and probability management algorithms.

[### Self-Assessed Generation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/hanlingsgjk/unifiedgeneralization?utm_source=tldrai)

SAG is a self-supervised framework designed to improve the generalization of optical flow and stereo methods in real-world applications. Unlike traditional approaches, SAG uses advanced reconstruction techniques to generate datasets from RGB images. It quantifies the confidence level of these results to address imperfections.
