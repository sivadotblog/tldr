[### AI is creating a golden age for scammers. Now is the time to get your personal details OFF the web (Sponsor)](https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=1151&amp;aff_id=16286)

Odds are, you've received a suspicious phone call, text, or email asking for money. The scam might have been easy to spot ‚Äî but with deepfakes and genAI, things are getting much weirder.

Sophisticated scams start with bad actors laying hands on your personal data. Often, they purchase this data legally from [data brokers](https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=1151&aff_id=16286) who profit from selling your phone number, DOB, SSN, and more.

[Incogni](https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=1151&aff_id=16286) scrubs your personal data from the web, confronting the 180+ data brokers on your behalf. And unlike other services, Incogni helps [remove your sensitive information from ALL broker types](https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=1151&aff_id=16286), including people search sites.

### Headlines & Launches

[### Claude's Character (37 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character?utm_source=tldrai)

Claude is more than just a middle-of-the-road, sycophantic AI that agrees with the user. Claude's personality and character have been specifically designed using a character variant of Constitutional AI. This post goes in-depth on how post-training is used to steer the type of output often generated by Claude to represent this desired character.

[### Apple To Launch ‚ÄúApple Intelligence‚Äù (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/07/report-apple-to-launch-ios-18-ai-features-marketed-as-apple-intelligence/?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple is set to introduce its AI initiatives under the brand name "Apple Intelligence" in iOS 18 and other operating systems, focusing on daily life enhancements rather than creative tasks. Features will include AI-generated notification summaries, rich auto-replies in Messages and Mail, intelligent email categorization, an emoji creator, AI-powered photo editing, and transcriptions in Voice Memos.

[### Databricks + Tabular (4 minute read)](https://www.databricks.com/blog/databricks-tabular?utm_source=tldrai)

Databricks has acquired Tabular, uniting key contributors to Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake to focus on data format compatibility for its lakehouse architecture. The goal is to achieve a single open standard for data interoperability to prevent data silos, starting with Delta Lake UniForm's compatibility solution.

### Research & Innovation

[### Object Detection with Open-Vocabulary Capabilities (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17270v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have upgraded the popular YOLO object detectors with YOLO-World, introducing open-vocabulary detection. This approach combines vision-language modeling and large-scale dataset training, allowing it to identify a vast array of objects quickly and accurately, even in scenarios it wasn't specifically trained for.

[### Improving Model with Synthetic Data (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04295?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a Synthetic-Domain Alignment (SDA) framework to enhance test-time adaptation (TTA) methods. SDA effectively aligns source and synthetic domains by fine-tuning pretrained models with synthetic data generated through a conditional diffusion model.

[### Boosting Text-to-Image Models with ReNO (15 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04312v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Reward-based Noise Optimization (ReNO) is a new approach to enhance Text-to-Image (T2I) models during inference that optimizes the initial noise using signals from human preference reward models.

### Miscellaneous

[### Building AI Products (8 minute read)](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/6/8/building-ai-products?utm_source=tldrai)

Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are not databases and can produce imprecise answers to questions, but they excel at generating responses that appear correct. The future of AI involves integrating LLMs into specialized tools or embedding them into existing applications, enhancing functionality while mitigating errors and improving user experience by contextualizing AI outputs within specific, manageable domains.

[### OmniPose 6D benchmark (5 minute read)](https://omni6dpose-pending.vercel.app/?utm_source=tldrai)
