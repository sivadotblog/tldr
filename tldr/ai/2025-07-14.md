### Headlines & Launches

[### Moonshot AI's Kimi K2 outperforms GPT-4 in key benchmarks (5 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/moonshot-ais-kimi-k2-outperforms-gpt-4-in-key-benchmarks-and-its-free/?utm_source=tldrai)

Chinese startup Moonshot AI released Kimi K2, a 1 trillion parameter open-source model that matches proprietary models on complex agentic tasks. The model was trained using a novel MuonClip optimizer that prevents training crashes that plague model development, potentially saving millions in computational costs.

[### Windsurf's CEO goes to Google; OpenAI's acquisition falls apart (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/windsurfs-ceo-goes-to-google-openais-acquisition-falls-apart/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google DeepMind hired Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and key researchers after OpenAI's $3 billion acquisition attempt failed. Google gains a nonexclusive license to Windsurf's technology, enhancing its AI coding capabilities without direct control. Windsurf faces uncertainty as it loses top talent, continuing to offer AI coding tools with Jeff Wang as interim CEO.

[### OpenAI delays the release of its open model, again (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/openai-delays-the-release-of-its-open-model-again/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is again delaying the release of its open model. The company had planned to release the model next week. The release has been pushed back indefinitely for further safety testing. The release of OpenAI's open model is one of the most highly anticipated AI events of the summer.

[### Apple Will Seriously Consider Buying Mistral (2 minute read)](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/apple-will-seriously-consider-buying-mistral-report/?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple is seriously considering acquiring Mistral, a French AI startup that has raised a total of ‚Ç¨1.1 billion over seven funding rounds. Mistral has launched a range of large and small language models over the years and achieved notable success with its optical character recognition features. It is currently Europe's biggest AI startup. The acquisition of an AI startup would provide a much-needed boost to Apple's AI ecosystem.

Asynchronous inference helps robotic policies run more smoothly by decoupling action prediction from execution, reducing idle time and improving responsiveness in real-world scenarios.

[### xAI's Grok 4: The tension of frontier performance with a side of Elon favoritism (12 minute read)](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/grok-4-an-o3-look-alike-in-search?utm_source=tldrai)

xAI launched Grok 4 on July 9. This post details everything about the model. It includes a performance overview, a survey of early vibe checks, tests of Grok 4 Heavy, and comparisons to OpenAI's o3 pro. The post also discusses xAI's lack of differentiated products, controversies, and culture risk. While Grok 4 is a very impressive model, it is plagued with serious behavioral risks and cultural concerns.

[### Scaling up RL is all the rage right now (2 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1944435412489171119.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Reinforcement learning (RL) will continue to lead to more gains because when done well, it is a lot more leveraged, more responsive to feedback, and superior to supervised fine-tuning. Researchers are likely to discover more about RL as rollout lengths continue to expand. There are a lot more S curves to discover, possibly specific to large language models and without analogues in game/robotics-like environments.

[### How to scale RL to 10^26 FLOPs (18 minute read)](https://blog.jxmo.io/p/how-to-scale-rl-to-1026-flops?utm_source=tldrai)

Reinforcement learning is the next training technique for building frontier-level AI models. Training it on more data will make it better. The current approach of scaling is messy and complicated. Finding a way to do next-token prediction on the web using RL would enable models to reason from general web data instead of just math and code.

[### The upcoming GPT-3 moment for RL (7 minute read)](https://www.mechanize.work/blog/the-upcoming-gpt-3-moment-for-rl/?utm_source=tldrai)

GPT-3 showed that scaling up language models unlocks powerful performance that often outperforms carefully fine-tuned models. Before GPT-3, achieving state-of-the-art performance meant first pretraining models, then fine-tuning them on specific tasks. Today's reinforcement learning is stuck in a similar pre-GPT paradigm. The approach suffers from the fundamental limitation where the resulting capabilities generalize poorly, leading to brittle performance that rapidly deteriorates outside of the precise contexts seen during training. The RL field will soon shift toward massive-scale training across thousands of diverse environments. Doing this effectively will produce RL models with strong abilities capable of quickly adapting to entirely new tasks - achieving this will require training environments at a scale and diversity that dwarfs anything currently available.
