### Headlines & Launches

[### Train a ChatGPT competitor for $85k and run it in your browser (8 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/17/beat-chatgpt-in-a-browser/?utm_source=tldrai)

Based on the calculations from the Llama paper, you could likely train your own 7 Billion parameter language model on purely public datasets for 82,000 GPU hours on A100 GPUs. Then by using self-instruct to further tune the model, you could have an open language model that is competitive with state of the art models.

[### Zapier launches Natural Language Actions (Product Launch)](https://zapier.com/l/natural-language-actions?utm_source=tldrai)

Zapier launched a general purpose, AI-powered API called Natural Language Actions (NLA) to integrate Zapier actions into any app. NLA is optimized for natural language based products, like chatbots or products built with LLMs, but can be used by any developer. Put Zapier's 5K+ apps and 20K+ actions inside your product and use simple natural language to move info between apps.

[### Midjourney v5 is here! (3 minute read)](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/midjourney-v5-language-model-adds-realism-to-human-hands/?utm_source=tldrai)

Midjourney announced version 5 of its commercial AI image-synthesis service, which can produce photorealistic images at a quality level that some AI art fans are calling creepy and "too perfect." Midjourney v5 offers a wider stylistic range, more prompt sensitivity, less unwanted text, and a 2x enhancement in image resolution. Midjourney v5 is available now as an alpha test for customers who subscribe to the Midjourney service, which is available through Discord.

### Research & Innovation

[### Comprehensive prompt engineering (22 minute read)](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/?utm_source=tldrai)

Prompt engineering is the process of steering language models to perform tasks. There are a number of different ways to do it from zero shot to few shot and chain of thought. This blog post contains extremely comprehensive citations and interesting ideas for future work.

[### Residual connection in Transformers has a privileged basis (18 minute read)](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/privileged-basis/index.html?utm_source=tldrai)

The skip connection in the Transformer architecture improves stability and trainability. Our theoretical understanding suggests that none of the dimensions in the residual connection should contain more information than others. In practice, however, this turns out to not be true with some dimensions having dramatically larger activation values. This post explores potential causes, and comes to the conclusion that the per-parameter memory in Adam might lead to this issue.

[### COLT5: Long-Input Transformer Model with Conditional Computation (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09752?utm_source=tldrai)

The article presents COLT5, a new long-input Transformer model that uses conditional computation to allocate more resources to important tokens, achieving state-of-the-art results on the long-input SCROLLS benchmark with faster training and inference, and effective processing of extremely long inputs.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Alpaca Lora (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora?utm_source=tldrai)

Low Rank Adaptation is a method to fine-tune language models by updating only a small subset of the parameters. This repo contains code that assists in tuning the popular Llama models via instruction tuning on consumer hardware due to the reduced computational requirements of Lora.

[### ML Commands (3 minute read)](https://www.craft.do/s/WaF8mlClNnheaM?utm_source=tldrai)

A list of extremely useful commands for ML research from a HuggingFace research scientist. It includes things like distributed training, environment set up, and configuration tasks. A useful reference for any practitioner.

[### GlueGen: Efficiently Upgrading Text-to-Image Models with GlueNet (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10056?utm_source=tldrai)

The article proposes GlueGen, a method that aligns features from different encoders with the latent space of an existing text-to-image (T2I) model using the GlueNet model and a new training objective. This allows for efficient integration of new functionality, such as multilingual language models and multi-modal encoders, into existing T2I models, enabling sound-to-image generation and upgrading the current text encoder for challenging case generation.

[### Khan Academy and OpenAI (4 minute read)](https://openai.com/customer-stories/khan-academy?utm_source=tldrai)

Khan Academy is a nonprofit that offers thousands of lessons in math, science and the humanities for students of all ages. Khan Academy announced that it will use GPT-4 to power Khanmigo, an AI-powered assistant that functions as both a virtual tutor for students and a classroom assistant for teachers. The nonprofit began testing the newest version of OpenAI‚Äôs language model in 2022 and will initially make the Khanmigo pilot program available to a limited number of participants, though the public is invited to join the waitlist.

[### Try out state of the art ASR system (HuggingFace Space)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/RamAnanth1/conformer-asr?utm_source=tldrai)

Assembly AI‚Äôs newest Conformer ASR system is a powerful model for a variety of tasks such as transcription, summarization, sentiment analysis, and topic detection - all from raw audio. The model is only accessible via API.
