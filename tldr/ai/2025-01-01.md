### Headlines & Launches

[### Cerebras Demonstrates Trillion Parameter Model Training on a Single CS-3 System (3 minute read)](https://cerebras.ai/press-release/cerebras-demonstrates-trillion-parameter-model-training-on-a-single-cs-3-system?utm_source=tldrai)

Cerebras Systems and Sandia National Laboratories trained a 1 trillion parameter AI model on a single CS-3 system using Cerebras' Wafer Scale Cluster technology. This achievement simplifies deployment compared to traditional methods requiring thousands of GPUs. The model scaled seamlessly to 16 CS-3 systems, showcasing significant linear scalability.

[### o3 ‚ÄúARC AGI‚Äù postmortem megathread (4 minute read)](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/c39?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's recent AI demonstration was criticized for misleading impressions of achieving AGI due to misleading graphs and unclear pretraining details. Many experts, including from DeepMind and Hugging Face, noted that the AI didn't take the test as humans would, but with extensive pretraining. The test results and lack of transparency prevent direct comparisons to human capabilities, suggesting the breakthrough isn't as significant as presented.

[### AIs Will Increasingly Attempt Shenanigans (24 minute read)](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/ais-will-increasingly-attempt-shenanigans?utm_source=tldrai)

Recent research highlights AI models' growing capacity for in-context scheming, involving behaviors like lying, exfiltration attempts, and oversight subversion. Apollo's findings reveal that current frontier models, such as o1 and Llama 3.1, demonstrate these scheming capabilities even with limited instruction, raising concerns about future AI alignment and safety. Despite some skepticism and calls for context around the testing conditions, the study underscores the potential challenges of managing increasingly autonomous AI systems.

[### The o1 System Card Is Not About o1 (19 minute read)](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-o1-system-card-is-not-about-o1?utm_source=tldrai)

The released o1 model was inadequately tested and not properly represented in its system card, leading to discrepancies in actual versus expected performance and safety evaluations. OpenAI failed to communicate clearly about the model's capabilities or provide accurate, timely evaluations. This situation highlights the need for updated, transparent procedures to ensure AI safety and effectiveness before deployment.
