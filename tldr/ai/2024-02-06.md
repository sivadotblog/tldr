### Headlines & Launches

[### Inside OpenAI‚Äôs Plan To Make AI More ‚ÄòDemocratic‚Äô (15 minute read)](https://time.com/6684266/openai-democracy-artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=tldrai)

In May 2023, Colin Megill met with OpenAI, including co-founder Wojciech Zaremba, to discuss integrating his public deliberation platform, Polis, which used AI to enhance democratic engagement. The collaboration aimed to align AI with human values through broad public input. It sparked OpenAI's "Democratic Inputs to AI" initiative to explore AI governance with a $1 million grant program.

[### Qwen 1.5 models released (5 minute read)](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen1.5/?utm_source=tldrai)

From 0.5B to 72B parameters. These are an impressive suite of multilingual models. Interestingly, the smallest model is the first serious sub 1B parameter language model.

### Research & Innovation

[### Boximator: Controllable video synthesis (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01566?utm_source=tldrai)

Video synthesis is notoriously hard to control. This work proposes using boxes and arrows to guide the generation over time, which improves human preference judgment but still doesn‚Äôt give perfect guidance to the user.

[### Multimodal Hallucinations in AI (6 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01345v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper sheds light on why large vision-language models (LVLMs) sometimes incorrectly describe images, a phenomenon known as multimodal hallucination. Semantic shift bias, particularly around paragraph breaks, is a key factor.

[### A New Optimization Method for Aligning AI (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01306v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) is a new approach for training AI models to align better with human thinking. By utilizing concepts from Kahneman & Tversky's prospect theory, KTO focuses on maximizing utility rather than just preference likelihood.

[### AI‚Äôs Labor Market Impacts Are Slower Than Expected (7 minute read)](https://aisupremacy.substack.com/p/mit-paper-ais-labor-market-impacts?utm_source=tldrai)

The working paper "Beyond AI Exposure: Which Tasks are Cost-Effective to Automate with Computer Vision?" by researchers from MIT and IBM examines the economic viability of automating vision-based tasks. It found only 23% are cost-effective for automation. The paper predicts a gradual labor market impact over years, contrasting with more disruptive forecasts.

[### A New Benchmark in Text Embedding Models (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01613v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Nomic-Embed-Text-V1 sets a new standard as an open-source, fully reproducible text embedding model. It excels in both short and long-context tasks. Unique in its transparency, Nomic-Embed-Text-V1 offers complete access to its training code, model weights, and a vast dataset of 235 million text pairs.

[### Pearls contextual bandit tutorial (12 minute read)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Pearl/blob/main/pearl/tutorials/contextual_bandits/contextual_bandits_tutorial.ipynb?utm_source=tldrai)

Pearls is an RL framework maintained by Meta. This tutorial walks through a bandit-based learning problem with the software.

BirdCast, a collaboration between the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Colorado State University, and UMass Amherst, uses machine learning and radar data to predict bird migrations. The project demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize ornithology by enhancing understanding of ecosystem health and migration patterns.

[### Matrices (Product Launch)](https://matrices.app/?utm_source=tldrai)

Matrices is an AI-native spreadsheet that creates itself and fills itself with whatever information you need. It can be extended with just natural language.

[### Roblox Releases Real-Time AI Chat Translator (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/5/24061495/roblox-generative-ai-chat-translator?utm_source=tldrai)

Roblox has developed an AI model capable of translating text chats in real-time across 16 languages to enhance user engagement by breaking down language barriers. It utilizes a transformer-based large language model within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for efficient resource use while maintaining their privacy and safety processes.
