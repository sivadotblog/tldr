[### Why Do AGI Timelines Vary So Widely? (12 minute read)](https://bluedot.org/blog/agi-timelines?utm_source=tldrai)

Many lab CEOs predict 2-5 years until AGI, while outside experts forecast decades or argue AGI is impossible with the current approach. Short-timeline advocates point to saturating benchmarks, AI task completion doubling every 7 months, and the potential for automated AI research to trigger an intelligence explosion. Long-timeline skeptics counter that benchmarks only measure easily defined tasks, that Moravec's Paradox suggests we've automated the "easy" cognitive work first, and that raw intelligence alone doesn't drive scientific breakthroughs.

[### Claude Code: An analysis (Book)](https://southbridge-research.notion.site/claude-code-an-agentic-cleanroom-analysis?utm_source=tldrai)

This is a report on Claude Code generated by Claude Opus 4 with the help of almost all of the major flagship models. Claude Code is an agentic coding tool with a few new novel components. It has a streaming architecture that handles real-time model responses, tool execution, and UI updates, safety systems that provide security without disrupting workflow, a tool design that bridges AI reasoning and system execution, and prompt engineering that reliably controls complex model behavior. The report covers the foundation of Claude Code's architecture, data structures and the information architecture, control flow and the orchestration engine, tools and the execution engine, and much more.

[### OpenAI Guide to A/B Testing LLMs for Startups (10 minute read)](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/stripe_model_eval/selecting_a_model_based_on_stripe_conversion?utm_source=tldrai)

HyperWrite's case study demonstrates A/B testing model performance based on actual payment conversions rather than offline benchmark scores. Its real-world tests revealed that GPT-4.1 matched Claude 3.5 Sonnet's conversion rate while reducing costs, proving that "good enough" performance at lower prices can be more valuable than benchmark leaders. The guide includes Python code for statistical testing and warns against common pitfalls like p-hacking and early result peeking.

[### How Much Do Language Models Memorize? (30 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24832?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers developed a method to separate true memorization from generalization by training models on random data where generalization is impossible versus real text. They discovered that models memorize training data until reaching capacity, then shift to learning general patterns, with GPT-style transformers storing ~3.6 bits of information per parameter. This explains why attempts to extract specific training data from modern LLMs often fail - their training datasets are much larger than their memorization capacity.

[### New Weights and Data for Vision-Language-Action Models (5 minute read)](https://impromptu-vla.c7w.tech/?utm_source=tldrai)

Impromptu VLA introduces a new dataset of 80,000 curated driving video clips to improve the performance of vision-language-action models in unstructured scenarios. It features planning-focused Q&A annotations and has shown measurable improvements in prediction and safety metrics across existing benchmarks.
