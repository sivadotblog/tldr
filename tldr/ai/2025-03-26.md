AI companies face a unique problem when it comes to pricing: On one hand, users expect a frictionless experience that allows experimentation without barriers. On the other, every product interaction comes at a very real price. Training models can cost millions, and expenses for API calls quickly add up.

That tension can make profitability a delicate balancing act ‚Äì but it doesn't have to. [As the billing engine powering OpenAI, Metronome wrote the pricing and billing playbook](https://metronome.com/blog/ai-pricing-and-billing-playbook-the-openai-case-study?utm_campaign=9129340-Killer%20Logos&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=tldr&utm_term=ai) that AI startups need to get their pricing right.

* Token-based pricing metrics to bridge resource consumption + user engagement
* Redefining billing as a product experience
* The nuances of OpenAI's PayGo + prepaid credits model
