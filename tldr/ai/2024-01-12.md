[### Improving Code Translation with Simple Language Help (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/pootiet/explain-then-translate?utm_source=tldrai)

This study demonstrates that adding simple language explanations to code significantly improves how language models translate between 19 different programming languages, especially for complex codes.

[### A New Method for Singing Voice Synthesis (9 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05064v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a new framework to better understand and analyze singing voices. By using self-supervised learning on isolated vocal tracks and focusing on out-of-domain generalization, they made progress in tasks like singing voice similarity and synthesis, improving upon existing technologies.

[### MiniMA, a New Efficient Language Model (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/genezc/minima?utm_source=tldrai)

This project tackles the challenge of distilling large language models into smaller student models. The researchers discovered a consistent optimal capacity gap for different student models and used the insight to create MiniMA, a 3B model distilled from a 7B teacher model. MiniMa sets new benchmarks in efficiency and performance.
