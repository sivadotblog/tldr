### Headlines & Launches

[### Oracle eyes $20 billion AI cloud computing deal with Meta, source says (2 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/business/oracle-talks-with-meta-20-billion-ai-cloud-computing-deal-bloomberg-reports-2025-09-19/?utm_source=tldrai)

Oracle is in talks with Meta for a multi-year cloud computing deal worth about $20 billion that would see Oracle provide Meta with computing capacity for training and deploying AI models. Oracle unveiled four multi-billion-dollar contracts last week. It expects to sign up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers in the next few months. Booked revenue at its OCI business will exceed half a trillion dollars.

[### Flooding the AI Frontier (8 minute read)](https://bturtel.substack.com/p/flooding-the-ai-frontier?utm_source=tldrai)

Chinese models are dominating the open-weight LLM space. Some of the models compete with or even outperform leading proprietary US models on common benchmarks. The Chinese government is promoting open models as part of its AI strategy. Flooding the market with free high-quality AI models helps China build its AI capabilities while making it harder for the US to sustain its lead.

[### The Extreme Inefficiency of RL for Frontier Models (15 minute read)](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/inefficiency-of-reinforcement-learning?utm_source=tldrai)

A key difference between pre-training and reinforcement learning (RL) is their information efficiency. Pre-training via next-token-prediction provides models with a token worth of information to learn from for every token the model produces during training, while RL requires a long chain of thousands and even millions of tokens before revealing to the model a single bit of information. RL provides models with much less information to learn from per GPU-hour. This has serious implications for how much the RL paradigm can achieve.

[### What GPT-oss Leaks About OpenAI's Training Data (21 minute read)](https://fi-le.net/oss/?utm_source=tldrai)

GPT-oss' weights are openly available, but the sources of training data are not clearly described in the model card. This article takes a look at the model's parameters to find out what the model was trained on. There is strong evidence that the models in the GPT-5 and GPT-oss family were trained on phrases from adult websites. There is weak evidence that part of the GPT training corpus was scraped off GitHub.

[### A postmortem of three recent issues (10 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/a-postmortem-of-three-recent-issues?utm_source=tldrai)

Between August and September, three overlapping infrastructure bugs caused Claude to produce degraded responses, including random foreign characters, misrouted requests to wrong server configurations, and an XLA compiler issue that dropped high-probability tokens.

[### LLM-Deflate: Extracting LLMs Into Datasets (14 minute read)](https://www.scalarlm.com/blog/llm-deflate-extracting-llms-into-datasets/?utm_source=tldrai)

Large language models compress massive amounts of training data into their parameters. This process can be reversed: structured data sets can be systematically extracted from trained models. This post discusses a decompression technique that can generate substantial training data sets from open-source models. The key is treating inference as a knowledge extraction tool rather than just a generation mechanism.

Nvidia paid $900 million to hire Enfabrica's CEO and other employees and to license the company's technology. Enfabrica's Technology can connect more than 100,000 GPUs together. It could help Nvidia offer integrated systems around its chips so clusters can effectively serve as a single computer. Nvidia had previously invested in Enfabrica as part of a $125 million Series B round in 2023.

[### Emad Mostaque on the End of Capitalism (14 minute read)](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/emad-mostaque-on-the-end-of-capitalism?utm_source=tldrai)

Emad Mostaque, former hedge fund manager and creator of Stable Diffusion, recently appeared in an interview where he discussed how Capitalism is about to become obsolete because of AI. He also talked about how AI will fundamentally transform the economy, replacing workers and making traditional economic structures obsolete - within 1,000 days. He advises people to build network capital and master AI now because human cognitive labor will become economically worthless soon.
