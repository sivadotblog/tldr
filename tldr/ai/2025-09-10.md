[### How Snowflake is adapting usage-based pricing to the AI era (Sponsor)](https://metronome.com/webinars/monetization-operating-model-webinar-series?utm_campaign=monetization-wp&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=tldr-ai&amp;utm_content=primary)

Snowflake's usage-based pricing has been one key driver of its market leadership. In this [webinar](https://metronome.com/webinars/monetization-operating-model-webinar-series?utm_campaign=monetization-wp&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_content=primary), you'll get an insider view of how the team managed its pricing and billing, and how they're preparing for the Al era of monetization.

Join Ryan Campbell, Director of Product Finance at Snowflake, and Scott Woody, Metronome CEO, to learn how Snowflake aligns finance, product, GTM, and engineering around pricing decisions. On the agenda:

* Reducing friction and accelerating pricing decisions
* Applying rigor and experimentation to your monetization model
* [Lessons from Snowflake](https://metronome.com/webinars/monetization-operating-model-webinar-series?utm_campaign=monetization-wp&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_content=primary) on designing pricing for predictability, visibility, and control

[### Claude Can Now Create and Edit Files (2 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files?utm_source=tldrai)

Claude can now generate and edit documents, spreadsheets, slides, and PDFs directly in the app, allowing users to turn prompts and data into downloadable files.

[### Microsoft to lessen reliance on OpenAI by buying AI from rival Anthropic (1 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/microsoft-to-lessen-reliance-on-openai-by-buying-ai-from-rival-anthropic/?utm_source=tldrai)

Claude will be integrated into Office 365 apps, ending Microsoft's exclusive reliance on OpenAI. OpenAI has continued to put strain on its relationship with Microsoft by announcing competitive products, including an AI-powered LinkedIn rival and custom chips built by Broadcom.

[### Nvidia unveils new GPU designed for long-context inference (1 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/nvidia-unveils-new-gpu-designed-for-long-context-inference/?utm_source=tldrai)

Nvidia has announced a new GPU called the Rubin CPX designed for context windows larger than 1 million tokens. The GPU, meant to be used as part of a broader 'disaggregated inference' infrastructure approach, is optimized for the processing of large sequences of context. It performs better on long-context tasks like video generation and software development. The Rubin CPX will be available at the end of 2026.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### The whole point of OpenAI's Responses API is to help them hide reasoning traces (5 minute read)](https://www.seangoedecke.com/responses-api/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's Responses API replaces the previous /chat/completions API for inference. The new API has a lot more features, but the main difference is that it is stateful. Users no longer have to pass the entire conversation history with each request, they just have to pass an ID representing the state of the conversation and the provider keeps models up to date. This allows OpenAI to keep its reasoning traces secret.

[### The Training Imperative (6 minute read)](https://sdan.io/blog/training-imperative?utm_source=tldrai)

Every serious AI company will eventually train its own models. The barrier to doing so is collapsing. Distillation, fine-tuning, and post-containing get easier every month. Soon, the only way to stay relevant will be to own your own models.

[### Thoughts on Evals (14 minute read)](https://www.raindrop.ai/blog/thoughts-on-evals?utm_source=tldrai)

Production monitoring reveals real issues that pre-deployment evals will inevitably miss, especially as AI products become more unpredictable and personalized. Evals are collections of already-known failure cases, but agents can and often do fail in ways that produce no error codes.
