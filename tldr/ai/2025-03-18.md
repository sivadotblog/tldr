[### This tech company grew 32,481%... (Sponsor)](https://invest.modemobile.com/?utm_source=dmrregahome&amp;utm_medium=Partner82-01-nvidia_growth&amp;utm_campaign=Newsletter_ID3650&amp;utm_content=nvidia_growth&amp;tnames=Partner82-01-nvidia_growth)

No, it's not Nvidia‚Ä¶ It's Mode Mobile, 2023's fastest-growing software company according to Deloitte.

Just as Uber turned vehicles into income-generating assets, Mode is [turning smartphones into the easiest passive income source](https://invest.modemobile.com/?utm_source=dmrregahome&utm_medium=Partner82-01-nvidia_growth&utm_campaign=Newsletter_ID3650&utm_content=nvidia_growth&tnames=Partner82-01-nvidia_growth), already helping 45M+ users earn $325M+ through simple, everyday use.

The technology behind it all is the EarnPhone, and it could be the biggest disruption to smartphones since the iPhone.

Mode has recently secured their Nasdaq stock ticker $MODE, [but you can still invest in their pre-IPO offering at just $0.26/share](https://invest.modemobile.com/?utm_source=dmrregahome&utm_medium=Partner82-01-nvidia_growth&utm_campaign=Newsletter_ID3650&utm_content=nvidia_growth&tnames=Partner82-01-nvidia_growth). They are over 95% towards their $20M February investment goal, with limited space left in the offering.
