[### Pilotless FedEx, Reliable Robotics Plane Completes Flight (5 minute read)](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/pilotless-fedex-plane?utm_source=tldrai)

Reliable Robotics Corp. has flown a small cargo plane without a human on board. The 12-minute flight, made with a plane on loan from FedEx, was Reliable Robotics' second automated flight. The startup is working to gain full approval from the FAA. Its system will restrict remote pilots to only supervising one aircraft at a time rather than managing multiple autonomous flights. Remote piloting will boost efficiency and allow planes to be repositioned more easily to match where demand is strongest.
