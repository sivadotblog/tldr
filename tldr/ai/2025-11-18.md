[### Lovart hits $30M ARR with Figma-like editing for AI designs (Sponsor)](https://www.lovart.ai/?sourceId=900187)

Lovart's design agent is the biggest revelation since Midjourney, and it's absolutely exploding: 3M+ users are now turning prompts into [brand-ready visuals, videos, and decks](https://www.lovart.ai/?sourceId=900187).

New features drops include:

🧑‍💻 Edit Elements is Lovart's new generation of [AI-powered design precision](https://www.lovart.ai/?sourceId=900187).Users have full control over their creations without regenerating from scratch - including Live Editable Text (LET) and Layer Separation - isolate text, subjects, and backgrounds to move, resize, and remix.

🎨 Multi-Model Blending integrates Sora 2, Veo 3.1, and Nano Banana to seamlessly combine motion, sound, and visuals.

⏩ Fast Mode boosts creation speed by up to 80%, enabling instant, high-quality outputs.

### Headlines & Launches

[### Grok 4.1 (6 minute read)](https://x.ai/news/grok-4-1?utm_source=tldrai)

Grok 4.1 is the top model on LMArena. xAI touted its large-scale post-training infrastructure as responsible for targeted improvements to emotional intelligence and creative writing, which suggests it is pursuing consumer-focused AI companion use cases currently dominated by ChatGPT.

[### Arm custom chips get a boost with Nvidia partnership (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/arm-nvidia-nvlink-partnership-custom-cpu.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Arm-based Neoverse CPUs can now be paired with Nvidia's GPUs using Nvidia's NVLink Fusion technology. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are all developing or deploying Arm-based CPUs in their clouds. The partnership will make it easier for customers of both companies to pair hardware together. The announcement signals that Nvidia has decided to open up its NVLink platform instead of forcing customers to use its CPUs.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Roadmap for Video-Based World Models (9 minute read)](https://world-model-roadmap.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

This roadmap outlines the progression of video generation systems into full-fledged simulators that combine internal physics-aware world models with visual rendering. It defines four developmental stages toward interactive and stochastic virtual environments.

[### The Agent Labs Thesis (12 minute read)](https://www.latent.space/p/agent-labs?utm_source=tldrai)

Agent Labs primarily research and sell agents. They put product first and use outcome-based pricing, as opposed to Model Labs, which put models first and price per token. Agent Labs have better cashflow economics, but it might take longer to see exit valuations. The Model Lab mission may be shifting, at least until the next big algorithm shift.

[### CUDA, Shmuda: Running AlphaFold on a MacBook Air (8 minute read)](https://latentspacecraft.com/posts/mlx-protein-folding?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple's MLX framework is great for science workloads because it was designed from the ground up to take advantage of Apple's unified memory architecture. Models like AlphaFold are memory-intensive, and almost all protein software is heavily optimized for CUDA. This post shows how a developer got AlphaFold to run on an Apple M chip machine. ARM chips like the Apple M are extremely fast and use only a fraction of the wattage that a single CUDA card needs, and getting a Mac device is a lot easier than getting a Blackwell GPU.

[### RL is even more information inefficient than you thought (12 minute read)](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/bits-per-sample?utm_source=tldrai)

It takes way more FLOPs to get a single sample in RL than it does in supervised learning. RL requires unrolling a whole thinking trajectory tens of thousands of tokens long to get a single reward signal at the end. In pretraining, you get a signal on every single token you train on. For most of training, the information density per sample is way lower for RL compared to supervised learning.

[### Replicate is joining Cloudflare (5 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/replicate-joins-cloudflare/?utm_source=tldrai)

Replicate, a platform for running AI models, is joining Cloudflare. Existing Replicate users will be able to continue work without interruption. Existing Workers AI users will soon receive a massive expansion of the model catalog and the new ability to run fine-tunes and custom models directly. Cloudflare's AI Gateway will provide users with a single control plane for observability, prompt management, A/B testing, and cost analytics across all of their models, whether they're running on Cloudflare, Replicate, or any other provider.

[### AA-Omniscience (7 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1990455484844003821.html?utm_source=tldrai)

AA-Omniscience is a benchmark for knowledge and hallucination across more than 40 topics. It punishes hallucinations by deducting points when models guess rather than admitting they do not know the answer. The benchmark complements the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index by incorporating the measurement of knowledge and probability of hallucination. This thread contains the benchmark results from testing cutting-edge models against AA-Omniscience.
