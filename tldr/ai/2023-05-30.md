### Headlines & Launches

[### Barkour: Google's 4 legged agility test (12 minute read)](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/05/barkour-benchmarking-animal-level.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Benchmarks are used to measure performance of various techniques in a standardized way. 4 legged robotic motion is an active area of research, but a lot of progress is hard to measure due to dissimilarities in evaluation environments. Google has presented an agility test for their own work and are now showcasing its usefulness.

[### Nvidia Unveils More AI Products (2 minute read)](https://archive.ph/V7pe3?utm_source=tldrai)

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently unveiled a new batch of products and services tied to artificial intelligence, including a new supercomputer, looking to capitalize on a frenzy that has made his company the world‚Äôs most valuable chipmaker.

[### The world‚Äôs biggest ad agency is going all in on AI with Nvidia‚Äôs help (4 minute read)](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/29/tech/nvidia-wpp-ai-advertising/index.html?utm_source=tldrai)

WPP, the world's largest advertising agency, is teaming up with Nvidia to use generative AI for creating personalized, scalable ads. The platform combines content from various sources, allowing for efficient production of highly adaptable advertising campaigns. The move has stirred concerns over potential job displacement in the advertising industry.

[### A Framework to Catch Factual Errors in Language Models (20 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13281?utm_source=tldrai)

This study presents a new way to automatically detect factual errors in text generated by artificial intelligence, or language models, by using a method inspired by truth-seeking processes in law known as cross-examination. The approach involves having two models interact, with one checking the claims made by the other through questions, proving significantly more effective in catching errors than existing methods, demonstrating the potential for improving the accuracy of AI-generated text.

[### Using 'According-to' Prompts to Keep Large Language Models Fact-Based (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13252?utm_source=tldrai)

This research proposes a new approach, called "according-to" prompting, to prevent AI from generating fake information by directing them to base their responses on previously seen text. We introduce a new evaluation score (QUIP-Score) that measures how much the AI's responses come directly from its training data, and show that these prompts help the AI stay more factual, with the added benefit of often improving its performance in given tasks.

[### How Large Language Models React to Conflicting External Information (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13300?utm_source=tldrai)

This study explores how large language models (LLMs), or AI that generates human-like text, respond when given new information that contradicts what they 'know'. Our research found that these models can be very receptive to the new information, provided it's coherent and convincing, but they also tend to confirm their existing 'knowledge' if the new data contains any elements that agree with it, a behavior known as confirmation bias. These findings are important for further improvements and applications of augmented LLMs.

[### Sophia (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Liuhong99/Sophia?utm_source=tldrai)

The official implementation of ‚ÄúSophia: A Scalable Stochastic Second-order Optimizer for Language Model Pre-training‚Äù

[### Niche models still outperform generalist ones (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/minosvasilias/godot-dodo?utm_source=tldrai)

The Godot engine is an open source game engine. It has a custom scripting language that allows users to code up gaming interactions. Generalist models don‚Äôt do super well when working with this language. This repository shows how to fine-tune open models on high quality instructions. This tuning let's star coders and other models dramatically outperform GPT4.

[### Docta (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Docta-ai/docta?utm_source=tldrai)

Docta is an advanced data-centric AI platform that offers a comprehensive range of services aimed at detecting and rectifying issues in your data.

### Miscellaneous

[### Meet Samantha (6 minute read)](https://erichartford.com/meet-samantha?utm_source=tldrai)

Language models have an odd ability to imitate agents. This means you can ask them to take on a persona. With some careful construction, you can distill this persona into a training data set for another model to use. In this case, GPT4 was distilled into Samantha - the prompt construction for that process is interesting.

[### Winning The AI Products Arm Race (17 minute read)](https://www.reforge.com/blog/ai-products-arms-race?utm_source=tldrai)

A full guide to creating AI products that people actually use, with key questions answered including why so many AI products fail and how to overcome the disadvantages of AI.

[### 100 terabyte GPU system (6 minute read)](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/announcing-nvidia-dgx-gh200-first-100-terabyte-gpu-memory-system/?utm_source=tldrai)

The new DGX is here! NVLink between nodes creates a system with 256 Grace CPUs (each with 480GB of LPDDR5) and 256 Hopper GPUs (each with 96GB of HBM3). Each GPU can directly access the memory of any other GPU or CPU at 900 Gbps. This leads to an amazing system for training models.

[### How The Media Is Covering ChatGPT (5 minute read)](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/media-coverage-chatgpt.php?utm_source=tldrai)

The article discusses the media coverage of ChatGPT, a large language model chatbot developed by OpenAI. The article argues that the media coverage of ChatGPT has been largely positive, and that the chatbot has been praised for its ability to generate human-quality text. However, the article also notes that some experts have expressed concerns about the potential for ChatGPT to be used to spread misinformation or to create harmful content.

[### Dreamore AI (Product Launch)](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/dreamore-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

Bring your dreams to life with Dreamore, the app that interprets and paints your subconscious thoughts. You can choose from different dream interpreters, such as Freud and Lord Shiva.

[### AI Allows Paralyzed Person To Write With His Mind (1 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/article/ai-allows-paralyzed-person-handwrite-his-mind?utm_source=tldrai)

The system uses electrodes implanted in the brain to detect brain activity related to imagining hand movements. This activity is then used to control a cursor on a computer screen, which can be used to write text. The system has been tested with a few paralyzed people, and it has been able to help them write at speeds of up to 66 characters per minute.

[### AI Is Already Making Functional Music (2 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/robots-ai/soundscapes?utm_source=tldrai)

UMG has teamed up with an AI startup called Endel to turn its artists' music into ‚Äúsoundscapes‚Äù designed to help listeners sleep, focus, and more. Endel uses AI to analyze a user's environment and preferences to create a personalized soundscape. The soundscapes are designed to help users relax, focus, or sleep.
