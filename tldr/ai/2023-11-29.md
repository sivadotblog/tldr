### Headlines & Launches

[### Meta AI Introduces CICERO (5 minute read)](https://ai.meta.com/research/cicero?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta‚Äôs CICERO is the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in the strategy game Diplomacy.

[### Stability AI releases SDXL Turbo (3 minute read)](https://stability.ai/news/stability-ai-sdxl-turbo?utm_source=tldrai)

Stability AI has released a new model that can generate high resolution images in 207ms. It doesn‚Äôt use LCM, which is what most of the field has moved towards. Instead, it uses a novel distillation technique called Adversarial Diffusion Distillation. Its weights and code have been used for research.

[### MLCommons AlgoPerf Training Benchmark Competition (7 minute read)](https://mlcommons.org/2023/11/mlc-algoperf-training-algorithms-competition/?utm_source=tldrai)

AlgoPerf is a new competition that aims to optimize for wall clock time. This means that if you can come up with a method that beats existing setups (e.g., faster than ADAM), you can win cash prizes. It‚Äôs an exciting challenge backed by some of the largest AI organizations today.

### Research & Innovation

[### Advanced Video Super-Resolution Through Diffusion Models (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15908v1?utm_source=tldrai)

StableVSR is a novel approach to video super-resolution (VSR) that leverages Diffusion Models and a Temporal Conditioning Module to enhance the quality of upscaled videos.

[### Enhancing Privacy in Sign Language Videos (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16060v1?utm_source=tldrai)

DiffSLVA is an innovative method for anonymizing sign language videos while preserving linguistic content. This technique, which uses pre-trained diffusion models and a specialized module for facial expressions, overcomes previous limitations by not requiring precise pose estimation.

[### Enhancing Dataset Distillation with Generative Diffusion Techniques (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15529v1?utm_source=tldrai)

A new method using generative diffusion techniques has been developed to create surrogate datasets that are more representative and diverse while requiring significantly less computational resources.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Tanuki (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Tanuki/tanuki.py?utm_source=tldrai)

Easily build LLM-powered apps that get cheaper and faster over time.

[### Effective prompting library for large multimodal models (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/roboflow/multimodal-maestro?utm_source=tldrai)

Set of Mark prompting is a clever way to dramatically improve vision+language model performance. This library from Roboflow gives you similar control and makes it easier to build robust vision pipelines with these models. It even supports open models like LLaVa.

[### Creating Realistic 3D Human Avatars from Videos (3 minute read)](https://animatable-gaussians.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

This project proposes "Animatable Gaussians," a novel technique that combines 2D CNNs and 3D Gaussian splatting to create more lifelike and detailed human avatars from videos.
