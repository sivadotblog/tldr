Voice is multi-dimensional. Tone and timing can change the meaning of a conversation and transcript-reliant LLMs miss it all.

So meet [Ensemble Listening Models](https://ensemblelisteningmodel.com/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=ai_newsletter&utm_campaign=elmlaunch) (ELMs), a new AI architecture built by Modulate, that orchestrates 100+ voice-specific models to better understand conversations. Modulate's ELM, [Velma](http://preview.modulate.ai/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=ai_newsletter&utm_campaign=elmlaunch), is now publicly available so you can harness human-level, real-time voice intelligence.

4 benefits of using Velma:

* Decode intent, emotion, stress, and authenticity in messy, multilingual audio.
* 100x faster, cheaper, and more accurate than LLMs.
* Traceable outputs with an explainable path. No black box, just evidence you can trust.
* Placed #1 on benchmarks for contextual understanding.

[### Lessons from Building AI Agents for Financial Services (23 minute read)](https://www.nicolasbustamante.com/p/lessons-from-building-ai-agents-for?utm_source=tldrai)

Building AI agents for financial services requires rigorous technical infrastructure and data normalization to avoid costly errors. Key insights include the essentiality of sandbox environments for secure multi-step workflows and the transformation of raw financial data into structured, searchable context through markdown and metadata. Skills systems, using markdown instead of code, allow dynamic, user-specific instructions for models, which is crucial as AI models rapidly improve and reduce the need for complex scaffolding.

[### Unrolling the Codex agent loop (17 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/unrolling-the-codex-agent-loop/?utm_source=tldrai)

Codex CLI is a cross-platform local software agent designed to produce high-quality, reliable software changes while operating safely and efficiently on users' machines. This is the first part in a series of posts that explores how Codex works. It focuses on the agent loop, which is the core logic responsible for orchestrating the interaction between the user, the model, and the tools the model invokes to perform work. The post provides a view into the role the Codex harness plays in making use of a large language model.

[### Challenges and Research Directions for Large Language Model Inference Hardware (1 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05047?utm_source=tldrai)

Large language model inference is hard. The primary challenges are memory and interconnect rather than compute. This paper highlights four architecture research opportunities: High Bandwidth Flash for 10X memory capacity with HBM-like bandwidth, Processing-Near-Memory and 3D memory-logic stacking for high memory bandwidth, and low-latency interconnect to speedup communication. The paper focuses on datacenter AI, but it also reviews the architectures' applicability for mobile devices.

[### Reinforcement Learning at Test Time (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/test-time-training/discover?utm_source=tldrai)

TTT-Discover applies reinforcement learning during inference, allowing LLMs to adapt to each task on the fly. It sets new performance benchmarks across math, biology, algorithms, and GPU kernels.

[### Diffusion-Based Code Modeling (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Stable-DiffCoder?utm_source=tldrai)

Stable-DiffCoder introduces block diffusion continual pretraining for code LLMs, showing performance gains over autoregressive models across several programming benchmarks, especially for editing, reasoning, and low-resource languages.

Clawdbot is an autonomous AI agent that runs locally and can execute real actions, not just generate text. Some features work immediately out of the box, like file management, basic research, and document processing, while advanced automations require hours or days of setup.

[### The Duelling Rhetoric at the AI Frontier (7 minute read)](https://deadneurons.substack.com/p/the-duelling-rhetoric-at-the-ai-frontier?utm_source=tldrai)

One CEO of a frontier AI lab might say AI will replace all software engineers within the next few months, while another will say that current AI systems are nowhere near human-level intelligence. Neither is probably lying, they're just making statements that benefit their businesses. AI executives aren't neural experts. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle.
