[### AI is writing more code. Someone still has to review it. (Sponsor)](https://www.greptile.com/?utm_source=tldr_ai&amp;utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=tldr_ai)

That review step is where bugs slip through, context gets lost, and teams slow down.

[Greptile](https://www.greptile.com/?utm_source=tldr_ai&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=tldr_ai) reviews each PR with full repo context and learns your team's conventions over time from comments, reactions, and what gets merged. It flags issues and suggests fixes that match your team, not generic best practices.

[### Meta's new AI team delivered first key models internally this month, CTO says (3 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-new-ai-team-has-delivered-first-key-models-internally-this-month-cto-says-2026-01-21/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta's new artificial intelligence lab has delivered its first high-profile models internally. The company's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, says the models show a lot of promise. There is still a tremendous amount of work required in the post-training phase before the models can be delivered in a way that's usable internally and by consumers. Meta is starting to see favorable returns from its big gambits in 2025. The next two years will be important for bringing consumer products to market.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Pass@k is Mostly Bunk (3 minute read)](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2026/01/21/pass-k.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Pass@k is the probability that at least one of k different attempts will succeed. It is one of the most common metrics used for agents. The problem with the metric is that it's exponentially forgiving, and humans interacting with agents aren't nearly that forgiving. Pass@k should be a metric that's rarely used, and carefully justified every time it is used.
