### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI's Board, Paraphrased: ‚ÄòTo Succeed, All We Need Is Unimaginable Sums of Money' (2 minute read)](https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/openai_unimaginable?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's shift from a public-benefit focus to for-profit resembles the early transitional story of Netscape as it leads the AI chatbot market but lacks a sustainable technical moat, suggesting funding is driven by an investment bubble. Despite already raising significant capital, OpenAI's board claims the need for even more funding, mirroring patterns of an unsustainable financial model.

[### Deepseek: The Quiet Giant Leading China's AI Race (26 minute read)](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/deepseek-ceo-interview-with-chinas?utm_source=tldrai)

Deepseek, a Chinese AI startup led by CEO Liang Wenfeng, has developed a model, the R1, that outperformed OpenAI's O1 on reasoning benchmarks. With backing from the quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer, Deepseek prioritizes research over commercialization and is committed to open sourcing. It has triggered price competition in China's AI market by offering affordable API rates. Focused on AGI, Deepseek emphasizes architectural innovations like Multi-Head Latent Attention and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts, challenging traditional models and fostering local talent in China's tech scene.

[### ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/chatgpt-now-lets-you-schedule-reminders-and-recurring-tasks/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has introduced a "tasks" feature for ChatGPT that allows paid users to set reminders and recurring requests. This beta lets the AI schedule notifications, such as weekend plans based on location or daily news briefings, marking a step towards more autonomous AI agents. The feature is initially available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users, with expansion plans underway.

[### Riffing on Machines of Loving Grace (21 minute read)](https://an1lam.substack.com/p/riffing-on-machines-of-loving-grace?utm_source=tldrai)

Dario Amodei's vision of "geniuses in a datacenter" suggests superhuman AI could revolutionize biology, from molecular design to experimental planning. Such AI could dramatically accelerate progress, particularly in molecular engineering, by overcoming current bottlenecks and unlocking new therapeutic platforms. These systems could also lead to paradigm-shifting discoveries, challenging existing scientific frameworks.

[### 1 step video generation (4 minute read)](https://seaweed-apt.com/?utm_source=tldrai)

This research uses an adversarial post training technique to transform an existing video model into a single step generation system. It works quite well using an adversarial post training technique that seems to approximate consistency tuning. The resulting model can generate 2 seconds of high quality video in real time. Note, the website is slow to load due to the high amount of videos.

[### Silicon Valley's turn of fortune: Intel has worst year ever, while Broadcom enjoys record gain (9 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/31/silicon-valley-turn-of-fortune-intel-worst-year-broadcom-record-gain.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Intel's stock plummeted 61% in 2024 due to its failure to capitalize on the AI wave, while Broadcom thrived with a 111% increase fueled by custom chips for major tech firms. Broadcom's XPUs have become crucial in the AI ecosystem, with collaborations with Google and others, whereas Intel struggles with outdated strategies and leadership changes. The contrasting fortunes highlight pivotal tech industry shifts and the significant market impact of AI advancements.
