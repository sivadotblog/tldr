### Headlines & Launches

[### Building LLM applications (18 minute read)](https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Chip Huyen has a wealth of knowledge and a huge amount of insightful blog posts. This is another in that long line of useful content. Specifically, there are two insights - it is easy to build something cool with LLMs and it is exceedingly hard to get that cool thing ready for production. A lot of the challenge comes from the ambiguity of natural language, and how to store prompts. There is also a list of promising use cases.

[### AWS Bedrock (11 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/announcing-new-tools-for-building-with-generative-ai-on-aws/?utm_source=tldrai)

Amazon has announced a new service for AWS called Bedrock that allows you to use foundation models from various companies such as anthropic and stability AI. The idea is to take an open model and bring your data (just point it to s3). There's been a lot of discussion recently around data privacy and security, with this service it might be possible to run the models in your own infra in AWS which is attractive from a privacy perspective. Amazon also announced two new models and free access to their code model for individual developers.

### Research & Innovation

[### Vicuna: An Open-Source Chatbot Impressing GPT-4 with 90% ChatGPT Quality (5 minute read)](https://vicuna.lmsys.org/?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces Vicuna-13B, an open-source chatbot trained by fine-tuning LLaMA on user-shared conversations. Vicuna-13B outperforms other models like LLaMA and Stanford Alpaca in over 90% of cases while achieving a quality of over 90% compared to OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard. The cost of training Vicuna-13B is around $300, and the code and demo are publicly available for non-commercial use.

[### DreamPose: Fashion Image-to-Video Synthesis via Stable Diffusion (3 minute read)](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/dreampose/?utm_source=tldrai)

DreamPose is a diffusion-based image-to-video synthesis model. Given an input image of a person and pose sequence, DreamPose synthesizes a photorealistic video of the input person following the pose sequence.

[### Dataset for Animated Kid‚Äôs drawings (4 minute read)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-dataset-animating-kids-drawings/?utm_source=tldrai)

In 2021, Meta released a cool demo of animating kid‚Äôs drawings with AI. Now they‚Äôve open sourced the dataset of 100k+ examples, animation code, pose finding, etc. It seems to be permissively licensed and useful for those interested in working in the automated animation space. It‚Äôs also nice to see some extra effort taken to preserve privacy when filtering the dataset.

[### Video editing with VidStyleODE (2 minute read)](https://cyberiada.github.io/VidStyleODE/?utm_source=tldrai)

VidStyleODE combines StyleGAN and Neural-ODEs for disentangled video representation, enabling applications like appearance manipulation, motion manipulation, image animation, and video interpolation/extrapolation.

[### Continual Diffusion (3 minute read)](https://jamessealesmith.github.io/continual-diffusion/?utm_source=tldrai)

Text-to-image diffusion models face catastrophic forgetting when customizing with sequential concepts, leading to poor image generation for past concepts. Our proposed C-LoRA method overcomes this issue with a continually self-regularized low-rank adaptation, outperforming baselines in continual diffusion and setting new state-of-the-art performance in rehearsal-free continual learning for image classification.

[### Adaptive Human Matting for Dynamic Videos (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06018?utm_source=tldrai)

AdaM, an Adaptive Matting framework for Dynamic Videos, tackles the limitations of trimap-free methods by simultaneously differentiating foregrounds from backgrounds and capturing alpha matte details in diverse, unstructured videos. Utilizing an interconnected encoder-decoder network and a transformer network, AdaM improves matting realism and temporal coherence, achieving best-in-class generalizability for complex real-world videos.

[### The Mounting Human And Environmental Costs Of AI (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/generative-ai-is-cool-but-lets-not-forget-its-human-and-environmental-costs/?utm_source=tldrai)

This article makes the argument that while generative AI is an exciting development, it is crucial to consider its human and environmental costs, such as increased energy consumption, carbon emissions, and the risk of eroding creative professions or exploiting human-generated content.

[### Chroma‚Äôs hacker in residence (2 minute read)](https://www.trychroma.com/blog/hir-2023?utm_source=tldrai)

On the tails of a recent fundraise, the vector database startup Chroma is looking to hire a hacker for 3 months to build cool AI applications that require long-term memory. Specifically, they hope this hacker can be mostly self driven and build something powerful! I expect to see more of these sorts of positions pop up, given the ease of MVP development on top of language models.
