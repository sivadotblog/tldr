[### Technical whitepaper: Extending Netflix Conductor to enterprise scale (Sponsor)](https://orkes.io/whitepapers/orkes-whitepaper-from-netflix-conductor-to-enterprise-scale/?utm_campaign=TLDR-flagship-Dec&amp;utm_source=Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=referral)

As services multiply, retries, cron jobs, and glue code can make orchestration brittle and hard to operate. Netflix Conductor was designed to solve this, but it's tricky to run at enterprise scale and security.

This whitepaper explains [how the creators of Netflix Conductor built Orkes Conductor](https://orkes.io/whitepapers/orkes-whitepaper-from-netflix-conductor-to-enterprise-scale/?utm_campaign=TLDR-flagship-Dec&utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=referral) -- the control tower for microservices that adds enterprise capabilities to the proven workflow engine. Read it for a deep dive into Orkes, including:

* Delivering durable event driven workflows with clear SLAs, and automatic recovery.
* [Scaling to millions of tasks per second](https://orkes.io/whitepapers/orkes-whitepaper-from-netflix-conductor-to-enterprise-scale/?utm_campaign=TLDR-flagship-Dec&utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=referral) with up to 99.99% uptime
* Enabling agentic orchestration that pulls humans in at the right moment

### Headlines & Launches

[### Shopify merchants can now sell products through AI chatbots (4 minute read)](https://betakit.com/shopify-merchants-can-now-sell-products-through-ai-chatbots/?utm_source=tldrai)

Shopify merchants' products can now be discovered on AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot. Agentic storefronts allow merchants to sell their products across popular API chatbots. Agents can answer customers' questions while giving merchants insight into search trends and topics customers are asking about. Shopify plans to make every Shopify store agent-ready by default.

[### Inside Meta's Pivot From Open Source to Money-Making AI Model (10 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/inside-meta-s-pivot-from-open-source-to-money-making-ai-model?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTQzNDQ0NCwiZXhwIjoxNzY2MDM5MjQ0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNzI0OE1LR0NUSTEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBOEExRDhFQTI5OTc0OTRGQTQ1QUE2REJBMjAwNTM3MSJ9.NRRnLMXFzQRSMMNYBa_aBBsRg9nBTaZQ3G2VJvzrlPM&utm_source=tldrai)

Meta is developing a closed model codenamed Avocado, expected next spring, after years of loudly supporting open-source. The new model is trained on the outputs (or “distilled”) from rival models, including Google's Gemma, OpenAI's gpt-oss, and Alibaba's Qwen. New Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang is reportedly chafing under Zuckerberg's “micromanagement”. Long-time AI head Yann LeCun left last month after being sidelined under the new org structure.

[### Google DeepMind Will Open a Robotic AI Lab in the UK to Discover New Materials (2 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/google-deepmind-will-open-a-robotic-ai-lab-in-the-uk-to-discover-new-materials?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTQzNDY3NiwiZXhwIjoxNzY2MDM5NDc2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNzFWVlZUOU5KTFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBOEExRDhFQTI5OTc0OTRGQTQ1QUE2REJBMjAwNTM3MSJ9.-vwf6ocQ_RMCLEh3Wq6HwGQ5MKtHTg0tYkNKyH5Q6pk&utm_source=tldrai)

Google DeepMind will open a research lab for discovering new materials in the UK as part of Alphabet's newly announced partnership with the British government. The agreement involves Alphabet tailoring several of its AI models for scientists, teachers, and public employees in the UK. The new lab will research materials that could improve medical imaging, solar panels, and chips. Using AI to unearth novel materials could drastically reduce costs and time.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### I Reverse Engineered ChatGPT's Memory System (5 minute read)](https://manthanguptaa.in/posts/chatgpt_memory/?utm_source=tldrai)

No vector databases, no RAG over conversation history. The system uses four layers: ephemeral session metadata (device, location, and usage patterns), long-term facts stored via a dedicated tool, lightweight summaries of recent messages, and a sliding window of the current conversation. OpenAI prioritizes speed and token efficiency over detailed historical context.

[### Is It a Bubble? (58 minute read)](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/is-it-a-bubble?utm_source=tldrai)

No one can definitively say whether we are currently in a bubble or not. No one should go all-in without acknowledging that they face the risk of ruin if things go badly. At the same time, no one should stay all-out and risk missing out on one of the great technological steps forward. A moderate position seems like the best approach. Intelligent investment requires sober, insightful judgment and skillful implementation.

[### Cursor Debug Mode (3 minute read)](https://cursor.com/blog/debug-mode?utm_source=tldrai)

Cursor has introduced Debug Mode, a new agent loop that incorporates runtime logs and human interaction to fix stubborn bugs. Inspired by expert debugging workflows, the mode generates multiple failure hypotheses, instruments code with logs, and loops in the user to reproduce errors and verify fixes.

[### Vectorized MAXSCORE over WAND: building faster text search for humans and agents (19 minute read)](https://turbopuffer.com/blog/fts-v2-maxscore?utm_source=tldrai)

Designing fast search engines is a subtle optimization problem. It takes effort to select the right algorithm and then tune it to get the best out of the CPU. Agents write longer queries than humans, so it is becoming increasingly important for text search to scale well with the number of terms. For text search, this means the cursor has shifted more and more from WAND to MAXSCORE.

[### Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems (2 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08296?utm_source=tldrai)

Agents are becoming the dominant paradigm for real-world AI applications. However, practitioners still rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. This study attempts to derive quantitative scaling principles for agent systems.

### Miscellaneous

[### Getting a Gemini API key is an exercise in frustration (11 minute read)](https://ankursethi.com/blog/gemini-api-key-frustration/?utm_source=tldrai)

Gemini is aimed at large organizations, not individual developers. It is designed for maximum compliance with government regulations, not for efficiency or productivity. Google doesn't want your business unless you're an organization that employs tens of thousands of people. OpenAI and Anthropic are much smaller and more nimble. They are able to make the process of setting up a developer account quick and easy.

[### AI World Models Reshape Interactive Storytelling (3 minute read)](https://x.com/Tocelot/status/1998791674353656257?utm_source=tldrai)

Advances in AI world models like Marble and Genie 3 generate explorable 3D environments from text, enabling creators to build interactive worlds and game mechanics with natural language. These systems open the door to generative multiverses where players act as co-creators and participate in emerging digital economies built on interoperable assets. The shift promises new storytelling formats and valuable training grounds for agents and robotics.

[### Nvidia-backed Starcloud trains first AI model in space as orbital data center race heats up (6 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/nvidia-backed-starcloud-trains-first-ai-model-in-space-orbital-data-centers.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Nvidia-backed Starcloud successfully trained the first AI model in space, using an Nvidia H100 GPU to run Google's Gemma LLM on their Starcloud-1 satellite. These orbital data centers promise significant energy savings compared to Earth-based facilities, addressing the growing power demands and environmental impact of terrestrial data centers. Starcloud plans a 5-gigawatt orbital data center to capture constant solar energy, with implications for both commercial AI workloads and real-time data analysis for military and emergency response operations.
