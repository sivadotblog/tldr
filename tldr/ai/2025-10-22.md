[### Mini Models Battle: Claude Haiku 4.5 vs GLM-4.6 vs GPT-5 Mini (8 minute read)](https://blog.kilocode.ai/p/mini-models-battle-claude-haiku-45?utm_source=tldrai)

Claude Haiku 4.5, GLM-4.6, and GPT-5 Mini all fall within a similar price bracket. They are mid-tier models optimized for cost and speed rather than maximum capability. GPT-5 Mini delivers the strongest concurrency safeguards, Haiku 4.5 is the fastest with the most features, and GLM-4.6 produces multi-file architecture but requires disabling reasoning mode for tool calls. Each model makes different trade-offs.

[### The Continual Learning Problem (22 minute read)](https://jessylin.com/2025/10/20/continual-learning/?utm_source=tldrai)

Memory layers are a natural architecture for models that are always training and continually learning from experience over time.
