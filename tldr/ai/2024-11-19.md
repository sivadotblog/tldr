[### Vector Databases Are the Wrong Abstraction (Sponsor)](https://www.timescale.com/blog/vector-databases-are-the-wrong-abstraction/)

You're building a RAG system, using Pinecone as a vector database to store and search embeddings.

But your text data doesn't fit well into Pinecone's metadata, so you're also using DynamoDB. And for lexical search, you need OpenSearch. Now you're juggling three systems, and syncing them is a nightmare.

Sound familiar? It's an [inherent problem with vector databases](https://www.timescale.com/blog/vector-databases-are-the-wrong-abstraction/) - and the solution might come from thinking about indexes, rather than vector data types.
