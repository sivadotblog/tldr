In The State of Observability 2025 report by Dynatrace, research findings show that 98% of ITOps leaders use AI for security compliance, but only 28% align observability data to business KPIs.

As enterprises scale AI, observability is shifting from reactive monitoring to a strategic intelligence layer.

[### Beyond Standard LLMs (46 minute read)](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/beyond-standard-llms?utm_source=tldrai)

The largest and most capable open-weight large language models today are autoregressive decoder-style transformers. Some alternatives have popped up in recent years. While some are geared toward better efficiency, others are aimed at improving model performance. This article gives an overview of alternative models that exist, from text diffusion models to the most recent linear attention hybrid architectures.

[### Chaining ffmpeg with a Browser Agent (4 minute read)](https://100x.bot/a/chaining-ffmpeg-with-browser-agent?utm_source=tldrai)

100x included ffmpeg into its Chrome extension to make complex media processing a single, serverless, and stateless step in any workflow. It already had a browser agent for automation - ffmpeg became another 'tool call' for the agent. This enabled the agent to deal with complex editing tasks like mixing audio and video and adding text over video. This post gives readers a look at how the integration works.

[### How We Built a Custom Vision LLM to Improve Document Processing at Grab (10 minute read)](https://engineering.grab.com/custom-vision-llm-at-grab?utm_source=tldrai)

Grab developed a lightweight, specialized Vision LLM from the ground up to address the limitations of traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems. Traditional OCR systems struggle with the variety of document templates they have to process and often fall short in understanding South East Asian languages. Grab's model can effectively replace traditional OCR pipelines, opening new possibilities for document processing at scale. This post details how the company built its new model and also provides performance results.

AI agents are rapidly becoming business-critical, but enterprise success is far from guaranteed. In fact, a new [Dataiku/Harris Poll survey](https://pages.dataiku.com/global-ai-confessions-report-data-leaders-edition?utm_campaign=23868186-GLO%20CONTENT%20Data%20Leaders%20Survey%20October%202025&utm_source=glo-tldr&utm_medium=paid-email&utm_content=data-primary) of 800+ global data leaders found that 95% admit they cannot fully trace AI decisions for audit purposes.The “[Global AI Confessions Report: Data Leaders Edition](https://pages.dataiku.com/global-ai-confessions-report-data-leaders-edition?utm_campaign=23868186-GLO%20CONTENT%20Data%20Leaders%20Survey%20October%202025&utm_source=glo-tldr&utm_medium=paid-email&utm_content=data-primary)” uncovers the hidden risks, misalignments, and urgent corrections leaders need to turn agents from a liability into measurable business value.

[### Exploring a space-based, scalable AI infrastructure system design (5 minute read)](https://research.google/blog/exploring-a-space-based-scalable-ai-infrastructure-system-design/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google will launch two satellites carrying its AI chips, called TPUs, in 2027, in hopes that in the mid-2030s space-based data centers will become more cost efficient since solar panels are up to 8x effective in orbit. Project Suncatcher envisions a constellation connected by optical inter-satellite links to power distributed ML tasks, like AI inference.

[### Run Any LLM with a Single API: Introducing any-llm v1.0 (2 minute read)](https://blog.mozilla.ai/run-any-llm-with-a-single-api-introducing-any-llm-v1-0/?utm_source=tldrai)

any-llm is an interface that can use any model, cloud or local, without requiring a rewrite of the stack every time. It makes it easy for developers to use any large language model without being locked into a single provider. any-llm decouples project logic from model provider with a stable and consistent API surface.

[### Profiling with Cursor 2.0: The Missing Layer in AI Code Generation (5 minute read)](https://ryanperry.io/post/cursor-profiling-missing-layer?utm_source=tldrai)

Profiling is the best way to separate code that looks good from code that is actually good. The Pyroscope Performance Profiler is a Cursor extension that takes profiling data and paints it right on the code. It allows developers to look at multiple solutions generated by different agents and pick the best based on real numbers. Performance comparisons across deployments, trend analysis, and incident inspection can all be done inside the editor without going to a separate UI.

[### Code execution with MCP: Building more efficient agents (15 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp?utm_source=tldrai)

Code execution can enable agents to interact with MCP servers more efficiently. When too many servers are connected, tool definitions and results can consume excessive tokens, reducing agent efficiency. Many of the problems with MCP feel novel, but they have known solutions from software engineering. Code execution applies established patterns to agents, letting them use familiar programming constructs to interact with MCP servers more efficiently.

Amazon has demanded that Perplexity stop its agentic web browser from buying products on behalf of humans. It claims that the Comet browser degrades the shopping and customer service experience that Amazon provides. Amazon has accused Perplexity of violating its terms of service and committing computer fraud by failing to disclose when an AI is shopping for a user. Perplexity responded by accusing Amazon of bullying and using litigation to stifle innovation.

[### The Company Quietly Funneling Paywalled Articles to AI Developers (10 minute read)](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/11/common-crawl-ai-training-data/684567/?gift=iWa_iB9lkw4UuiWbIbrWGQv84IP0_-K67yuVC013Fx4&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

At the heart of AI web scraping is Common Crawl, a small nonprofit that supplies, and is funded by, major AI labs with internet data while flagrantly disregarding paywalls and removal requests. The organization has gathered millions of articles from The New York Times, The Atlantic, and other publishers (many of them now suing AI companies), but has avoided compliance by making its search tool return "no captures" for domains that actually contain thousands of articles.
