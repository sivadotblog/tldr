### Research & Innovation

[### Reka Vibe-Eval (12 minute read)](https://www.reka.ai/news/vibe-eval?utm_source=tldrai)

Reka trains large foundation models and has quickly caught up to some of the best players despite having a fraction of the funding. It has released a subset of its internal evaluation suite, which it uses to determine how strong its models are.

[### KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (60 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756?utm_source=tldrai)

Multi-Layer Perceptrons are used widely in AI today, including in the Transformer between Attention layers. However, they use fixed activation functions. This paper suggests using learned activation functions on edges using the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation (functions can be represented by a superposition of simpler functions). In this case, the researchers replace weights with splines. The architecture is much more complicated, but has some interesting properties that potentially make it more interpretable.

[### A.I. Start-Ups Face a Rough Financial Reality Check (6 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/29/technology/ai-startups-financial-reality.html?utm_source=tldrai)

High-profile AI startups like Inflection AI, Stability AI, and Anthropic are facing financial pressures as they struggle with the high costs of developing generative AI models. While OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, has shown revenue growth, competitors like Anthropic and Stability AI grapple with substantial gaps between revenue and operating expenses. Microsoft's investment in AI hints at the tech industry's belief in AI's long-term profitability, despite the current challenges in monetizing these expensive technologies.

[### GPT-2? (7 minute read)](https://rentry.co/GPT2?utm_source=tldrai)

A mysterious AI model named gpt2-chatbot, displaying capabilities akin to GPT-4.5, has emerged on lmsys.org, prompting speculation of it being an unofficial OpenAI test for their next iteration. Key identifiers such as response quality, OpenAI-specific traits, and rate limits suggest a high level of sophistication, potentially hinting at a discreet benchmarking initiative by OpenAI. Investigations and discussions around gpt2-chatbot's origins and capabilities are ongoing in the AI community.
