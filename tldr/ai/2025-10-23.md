[### Roll up your sleeves to build the next wave of agentic AI at BUILD 2025 (Sponsor)](https://www.snowflake.com/en/build/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=snowflake-build25)

You can't have an AI strategy without a data strategy. The most powerful agents are grounded in your data, connected across pipelines, and deployed securely at scale.

Join [BUILD](https://www.snowflake.com/en/build/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=snowflake-build25) (Nov 4-7), a free virtual developer conference where you'll learn how build reliable, production-ready agentic applications on Snowflake. Expect:

* Deep dives on the latest Snowflake AI capabilities and cool OSS use cases with LlamaIndex, CrewAI, LangGraph, Postgres, Streamlit, TruLens, and more.
* Hands-on labs using Snowflake managed MCP and optimizing Llama for performance, cost, and architecture.
* Inspiration from industry leaders like Andrew Ng, Mark Russinovich (Microsoft Azure), Guillermo Rauch (Vercel), and Anahita Tafvizi (Snowflake).

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Meta lays off 600 from ‚Äòbloated' AI unit as Wang cements leadership (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/meta-layoffs-ai.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta will lay off roughly 600 employees to reduce layers and operate more nimbly. The cuts will impact workers across Meta's AI infrastructure units, the Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research unit, and other product-related positions. They will not impact employees within TBD Labs. Meta will pay 16 weeks of severance plus two weeks for every completed year of service, minus the notice period.

[### Snapchat makes its first open prompt AI Lens available for free in the US (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/snapchat-makes-its-first-open-prompt-ai-lens-available-for-free-in-the-us/?utm_source=tldrai)

Snapchat's new "Imagine Lens" AI, initially exclusive to paid users, is now free in the US, allowing users to edit or generate Snaps by inputting custom prompts. This expansion comes amid competition from Meta and OpenAI's advanced AI video features. Snap aims to attract users by offering limited free AI-generated images with plans to expand access to other countries.

[### Why Cohere's ex-AI research lead is betting against the scaling race (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/22/why-coheres-ex-ai-research-lead-is-betting-against-the-scaling-race/?utm_source=tldrai)

AI labs are racing to build giant data centers due to a deep belief that adding more compute power to existing AI training methods will eventually yield superintelligent systems. A growing group of AI researchers are saying that the scaling of large language models may be reaching its limits and that other breakthroughs may be needed to improve AI performance. Cohere's former VP of AI Research has launched a new startup, Adaption Labs, to build thinking machines that adapt and continuously learn. If the startup is right about the limitations of scaling, the implications could be huge - billions of dollars have already been invested in scaling.

Helion is a Python-embedded domain-specific language (DSL) for authoring machine learning kernels that compiles down to Triton. It makes it easier to write correct and efficient kernels while enabling more automation in the autotuning process. Helion combines a familiar and high-level PyTorch-like syntax with a powerful ahead-of-time autotuning engine to provide a unique balance of developer productivity, fine-grained control, and performance portability. It is currently in beta.

[### Reddit sues Perplexity for allegedly ripping its content to feed AI (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/news/804660/reddit-suing-perplexity-data-scrapers-ai-lawsuit?utm_source=tldrai)

Reddit is suing Perplexity, SerpApi, Oxylabs, and AWMProxy to stop them from scraping its data. It claims Perplexity will apparently do anything to get Reddit's data except enter into an agreement with Reddit directly. Reddit sent a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity in May last year, demanding it stop scraping Reddit data, but Perplexity claimed it didn't use Reddit content. This was shown to be untrue after content posted on Reddit was produced by Perplexity within hours of the post being made.
