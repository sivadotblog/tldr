Smart-doorbell pioneer, RING, pitched on the hit show Shark Tank at a valuation of just $7 million ‚Äî the sharks shut them down.

5 years later, the company sold to Amazon for more than $1 Billion. Turning the 10% stake initially offered to the sharks from $700K into $100M!

[A similar story is brewing](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=aion,09-13-2023) in the Smart Shades segment of the industry, with a company called [RYSE](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=aion,09-13-2023) pitching on the Canadian version of Shark Tank called Dragon‚Äôs Den.

The difference? [They received two offers](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=aion,09-13-2023) and have an addressable market that could be significantly larger than that of RING‚Äôs!

Arcus scales RAG to planet scale by using a hierarchical retriever. After clustering documents into groups based on their semantic content, you can progressively filter over these groups to narrow the search space. This results in much more relevant context being retrieved, fewer hallucinations, and better reliability over planet-scale corpuses of data.
