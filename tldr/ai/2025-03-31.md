[### Reasoning augmented generation code (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/superagent-ai/reag?utm_source=tldrai)

Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on a two-step process: first, semantic search retrieves documents based on surface-level similarities. Then, a language model generates answers from those documents. While this method works, it often misses deeper contextual insights and can pull in irrelevant information. ReAG ‚Äì Reasoning Augmented Generation ‚Äì offers a robust alternative by feeding raw documents directly to the language model, allowing it to assess and integrate the full context. This unified approach leads to more accurate, nuanced, and context-aware responses.
