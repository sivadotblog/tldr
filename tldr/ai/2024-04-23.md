### Research & Innovation

[### MoVA: A New Multimodal Language Models (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13046v1?utm_source=tldrai)

MoVA is a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that improves image content understanding by selectively integrating different vision encoders. It addresses the limitations of current encoders like CLIP by using a context-aware expert routing strategy and a mixture-of-vision-expert adapter to dynamically fuse expertise from various sources.

[### ByteDance's DecoupleQ for Model Compression (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12759v1?utm_source=tldrai)

DecoupleQ is a quantization approach that significantly enhances the accuracy of large models at ultra-low bit levels. This method restructures the quantization process by splitting model parameters into integer and floating-point parts that are then optimized using traditional methods.

[### LiDAR-Based Moving Object Segmentation (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12794v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed MambaMOS, a new approach for segmenting moving objects in LiDAR point clouds.
