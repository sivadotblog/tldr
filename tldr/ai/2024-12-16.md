### Research & Innovation

[### Phi-4 (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08905?utm_source=tldrai)

A synthetically trained language model from Microsoft that excels at a number of challenging benchmarks. The weights are coming this week. Interestingly, it confirmed the suspicion that ‚ÄúMid Training‚Äù can be used for context length extension.

[### Efficient Scene Understanding via Modular Design (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09530?utm_source=tldrai)

A new modular framework that enhances scene understanding by decomposing tasks into specialized modules, achieving efficiency and improved interpretability in complex environments.

[### BLT: Token Free Language Model Training (33 minute read)](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/byte-latent-transformer-patches-scale-better-than-tokens/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta has released details and training code for the Byte Latent Transformer which uses learned patches instead of tokens for training, essentially eliminating a challenging portion of language modeling. Importantly, it found that its paradigm scales better to small Llama 2 sized models.

### Engineering & Resources

[### But where's the ROI? The True Costs of Poor LLM Strategy, Evaluation, and Training (Sponsor)](https://go.turing.com/resources/maximizing-llm-roi?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=syndicate&amp;utm_campaign=20241216_TLDR_customer&amp;utm_content=maximizing-llm-roi&amp;utm_term=client-gen-edu_ai-secondary)

GenAI is projected to drive $7tn by 2030. But for companies to realize this value, they need an ROI-driven LLM strategy. Grab a copy of Turing's whitepaper for practical ways to [turn underperforming LLMs into competitive assets](https://go.turing.com/resources/maximizing-llm-roi?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=syndicate&utm_campaign=20241216_TLDR_customer&utm_content=maximizing-llm-roi&utm_term=client-gen-edu_ai-secondary), including: reasoning, multimodality, and coding; key evaluation/training techniques; and avoiding common pitfalls.

[### Convert any Microsoft Office file to Markdown (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft has released a package that can convert any docx, xslx, or ppt files to markdown for efficient use as context for a language model.

[### Best of N Jailbreaking (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/jplhughes/bon-jailbreaking?utm_source=tldrai)

Jailbreaking is when you bypass a model's trained-in refusals to get it to generate text for something deemed inappropriate. This is surprisingly easy to achieve - simply brute force random capitalization and punctuation in the input prompt until the model responds with the results you want to extract.

[### DeepSeek VL2 (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL2?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepSeek has released another great model, this time in the form of a new MoE vision language model. It is extremely efficient and outperforms a number of dense models.
