[### Here's How Much OpenAI Spends On Inference and Its Revenue Share With Microsoft (8 minute read)](https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai_docs/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI spent $5.02 billion on inference alone with Microsoft Azure in the first half of 2025. This pattern continued through the end of September. The company's inference costs have risen consistently over the last 18 months. OpenAI's inference costs easily eclipse its revenues.

[### Common Ground between AI 2027 & AI as Normal Technology (15 minute read)](https://asteriskmag.substack.com/p/common-ground-between-ai-2027-and?utm_source=tldrai)

Surprisingly, the authors of "AI 2027" (who predict superintelligence within a decade) and "AI as Normal Technology" (who expect gradual diffusion like electricity) agree on many areas. They say most benchmarks will be saturated by 2027-2028 with AI matching expert humans, yet systems will still regularly fail at mundane tasks like "book me a flight to Paris" through 2029 due to long-tail errors. The world will look basically the same in 2029, even with AGI right around the corner.

The 2025 automation landscape is confusing. Many solutions can deliver quick wins, but also trap value in silos, create technical debt, and block visibility. [This guide](https://page.camunda.com/wp-camunda-compared-to-alternatives-guide?utm_medium=paid_leadgen&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=Whitepaper.CamundaVsAlternatives.24Q3.EN&utm_content=nov13_email) provides a comprehensive comparison of leading automation technologies and platforms, highlighting what truly matters when orchestrating complex, cross-functional processes.

[### Baidu just dropped an open-source multimodal AI that it claims beats GPT-5 and Gemini (18 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/baidu-just-dropped-an-open-source-multimodal-ai-that-it-claims-beats-gpt-5?utm_source=tldrai)

ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking is a 28-billion-parameter multimodal AI model that only activates 3 billion parameters during operation. It has a sophisticated routing architecture that allows it to match or exceed the performance of much larger competing systems on several categories of tasks. The model's most distinctive feature is 'Thinking with Images', a capability that allows the AI to dynamically zoom in and out of images to examine details. The feature dramatically elevates the model's ability to handle long-tail visual knowledge. The model has been released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, which allows unrestricted commercial use.

AlphaProof reached silver medal performance in the International Mathematical Olympiad 2024. This post shares details about how the model works. AlphaProof demonstrates how test-time compute can be scaled to obtain improved answers over many orders of magnitude. The researchers developing it were entirely limited by how many TPUs they could get their hands on.
