### Headlines & Launches

[### Adept AI releases an open source LLM (7 minute read)](https://www.adept.ai/blog/persimmon-8b?utm_source=tldrai)

Persimmon, originally Adept, has released Persimmon-8B, an extremely performant 8b parameter model. It has also released inference code. There are a number of niceties - one particularly interesting tidbit is 70k unused embeddings, which allows for multimodal extensions.

[### Claude Gets A Paid Plan (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23862848/anthropic-claude-pro-ai-chatbot-paid-plan-google?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic has launched a paid version of its Claude chatbot priced at $20 per month.

### Research & Innovation

[### HyperDiffusion: Generating Implicit Neural Fields with Weight-Space Diffusion (28 minute read)](https://ziyaerkoc.com/hyperdiffusion/?utm_source=tldrai)

Neural fields use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to represent a 3D scene. It turns out you can apply diffusion directly to the weights of the MLP and generate a novel 3D scene.

[### Using LLMs to Predict Stock Trends (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03079v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces a way to use large language models to quickly analyze long Annual Reports from companies, making it easier to understand their financial health and even predict stock prices.

[### One Wide Feedforward is All You Need (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01826?utm_source=tldrai)

The feedforward layers of the transformer make up a significant portion of the total weights in the network. However, if you use a single large feedforward layer shared between the encoder and decoder, you can dramatically improve inference time with minimal drops in performance.

### Engineering & Resources

[### OnPrem.LLM (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/amaiya/onprem?utm_source=tldrai)

OnPrem.LLM is a simple Python package that makes it easier to run large language models on non-public or sensitive data and on machines with no internet connectivity.

[### A Better Understanding of 3D Scenes Over Time (4 minute read)](https://markomih.github.io/ResFields/?utm_source=tldrai)

ResFields is a new kind of neural network that's really good at understanding complex 3D scenes as they change over time. By adding something called 'temporal residual layers,' it can deal with a lot more information and still stay accurate.

[### Generative image restoration (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/DiffBIR?utm_source=tldrai)

Powerful upscaling and restoration models that use diffusion to reduce blur and sharpen image details. Model checkpoints included.

ProteinQure revolutionizes chemotherapy using advanced ML and molecular simulations on supercomputers. Using their platform - ProteinStudio - they designed PQ-001, a precision drug targeting breast cancer. This drug, akin to a guided missile, zeroes in on cancer cells, sparing the healthy ones and avoiding common chemo side effects. Following successful animal trials, they're now developing this drug further towards the first dose in humans.
