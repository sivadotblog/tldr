[### Mitigating AI risks: a governance strategy for new technologies, new threats, and new regulations (Sponsor)](https://domino.ai/resources/mitigating-ai-risks-governance-strategies-for-ai-new-threats?&amp;utm_medium=sponsored_email&amp;utm_source=TLDR&amp;utm_campaign=mitigating_ai_risks_webinar&amp;utm_content=newsletter_email)

Current governance processes are a poor fit for AI and data science. They waste resources, delay initiatives and leave too much residual risk. A new strategy is needed.

[Join the webinar next Tuesday](https://domino.ai/resources/mitigating-ai-risks-governance-strategies-for-ai-new-threats?&utm_medium=sponsored_email&utm_source=TLDR&utm_campaign=mitigating_ai_risks_webinar&utm_content=newsletter_email) (October 22nd) to learn about identifying threats, governance strategies, and evolving AI regulations.

As part of the webinar, the Domino team will also discuss recently-announced additional governance capabilities, [Domino Governance](https://domino.ai/topics/enterprise-ai-governance?&utm_medium=sponsored_email&utm_source=TLDR&utm_campaign=governance&utm_content=newsletter_email). These allow you to define policies from scratch or templates, capture/review evidence, and get a global view of policies and compliance.

Learn how you can shorten the time to comply with new policies from months to weeks.
