[### Interaction Processing Units (8 minute read)](https://nilscrm.github.io/ipu.html?utm_source=tldrai)

This article explores the development of computer hardware based on Interaction Nets, a computational model that represents calculations as interacting graph nodes. While current implementations like HVM show promise for parallel processing, traditional hardware isn't optimized for graph-based operations. The author proposes that custom hardware architecture could better utilize Interaction Nets' inherent parallelism and local memory access patterns, particularly benefiting algorithms with non-homogeneous parallelism like optimization problems and graph processing.
