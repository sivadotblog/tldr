[### AGI Trades (3 minute read)](https://dcgross.com/agitrades?utm_source=tldrai)

Advanced AIs like GPT-5 could have significant impacts across markets, real estate, labor, energy, national economies, geopolitics, and the economy's inflationary dynamics, leading to a reevaluation of value accrual, global power shifts, and changes in employment and economic structures.

[### The Techno-Industrial Revolution (18 minute read)](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-techno-industrial-revolution?utm_source=tldrai)

As AI tooling and business use cases become more sophisticated, we‚Äôll start to see more and more real-world applications of the tech. One lens to look at the opportunity here is how AI will make processes cheaper and more efficient whilst growing margins substantially. This might unlock a whole new way of doing things that previously didn‚Äôt make economic sense because margins were too thin. This article explores a few of these examples.
