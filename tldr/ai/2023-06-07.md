### Headlines & Launches

[### Help make AI that's not just English based (4 minute read)](https://txt.cohere.com/aya-multilingual/?utm_source=tldrai)

Language modeling startup Cohere's research arm is leading an instruction tuning endeavor to bring state of the art generative modeling performance to more languages than just English. They're engaging with the community in this cross organization effort.

[### Why AI Will Save the World (12 minute read)](https://pmarca.substack.com/p/why-ai-will-save-the-world?utm_source=tldrai)

He doesn‚Äôt post often, but when he does, Andreessen is always full of gems. Marc Andreessen makes the case that AI is the greatest invention of all time, as the technology can be used to make every single aspect of human life better.

[### RedPajama 7B model finished training (6 minute read)](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama-7b?utm_source=tldrai)

The RedPajama dataset along with partially trained models was released a few weeks ago. The 7B model just finished its training on 3000 V100s. The instruction tuned version is the most performant open model of its size. The team has lots of plans for continued model development.

### Research & Innovation

[### StableRep: Using Artificial Images to Improve Visual Learning (23 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00984?utm_source=tldrai)

This research investigates the effectiveness of learning visual concepts using artificially generated images from a text-to-image model called Stable Diffusion. The authors introduce StableRep, a method that treats images produced from the same text prompt as related, which leads to improved performance over existing methods like SimCLR and CLIP, even with synthetic images alone.

[### Almost 100B multilingual legal tokens (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02069?utm_source=tldrai)

A huge new corpus of legal documents in 24 languages just arrived. Also, trained models and training code are available. They found that models trained on this 689GB corpus achieve a new state of the art for legal language models.

[### MotionDiffuser: A Technique for Predicting Future Movements of Multiple Agents (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03083?utm_source=tldrai)

MotionDiffuser is a new technology that uses diffusion processes to predict different possible future movements of multiple entities, such as vehicles or robots. It learns to forecast these movements effectively, handles various scenarios with a straightforward design. Its sampling feature allows us to guide these forecasts under different rules or simulations, showing remarkable results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

### Engineering & Resources

[### End-to-end test coverage with zero flakes (Sponsor)](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=DeveloperPlacement07062023&amp;utm_source=tldrai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter)

AI can't get you to high automated test coverage fast - but QA Wolf can. They write everything in open-source Playwright (you own the code!) and provide the infra to run your entire test suite in parallel on every deploy. Plus, they take care of maintenance (even full refactors!) so your team can stay focused on shipping features. [It‚Äôs like magic but it‚Äôs QA Wolf.](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=DeveloperPlacement07062023&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter) ‚ú®

[### Aviary (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ray-project/aviary?utm_source=tldrai)

Aviary is an app that lets you interact with a variety of large language models (LLMs) in a single place. You can compare the outputs of different models directly, rank them by quality, get a cost and latency estimate, and more.

[### InstructZero: Improving Instruction Giving for LLMs Using Soft Prompts (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/lichang-chen/instructzero?utm_source=tldrai)

The research introduces InstructZero, a new method for making large language models (LLMs) better at following instructions, even when you can't directly tweak them (known as "black-box" models). This method uses "soft prompts" which are optimized to create better instructions, and our tests show that it works better than current top methods in different tasks with various LLMs, including Vicuna and ChatGPT.

[### HQ-SAM: Improving 'Segment Anything Model' for Better Object Segmentation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/syscv/sam-hq?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers developed HQ-SAM, an upgrade to the recent 'Segment Anything Model' (SAM), which enhances its ability to outline any object, even those with complex structures, while keeping its original benefits.

### Miscellaneous

[### OpenAI Is Staying Private (1 minute read)](https://archive.ph/hNAdV?utm_source=tldrai)

Sam Altman said he‚Äôs not interested in taking OpenAI public because he wants to maintain full control over the technology as it becomes more powerful.

[### GGML forms a company (2 minute read)](https://ggml.ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Large language models are often expensive to run locally. GGML is a framework written in pure C that makes it easy to run instead of their language models on MacBook computers. It is used by the hobbyist community currently, but has many applications for Enterprise deployment of models.

[### Apple Avoids AI At WWDC (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/at-apples-wwdc-keynote-ai-never-came-up-by-name-but-it-was-there/?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple avoided using the term "AI" at its WWDC keynote, but the company's new products and features were still powered by machine learning. For example, the new iOS 17 autocorrect feature uses a transformer language model, which is a type of AI that has been powering recent generative AI innovations.
