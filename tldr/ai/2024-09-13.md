### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI's newest model (8 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has released its next model, which was trained to think before it answers. The new model was trained with reasoning traces and spends time considering before it answers. In some domains, this has led to super human performance. The model will be rate limited to 30 or so queries per user per week, but OpenAI hopes to lift that restriction soon.

[### Google is now rolling out Gemini Live to free users on Android (2 minute read)](https://9to5google.com/2024/09/12/gemini-live-android-free-users/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google is rolling out Gemini Live, its conversational AI feature, to free Android users after a month of advanced user access. Users can interrupt responses with new information and receive text transcripts of their interactions. Although Gemini Live doesn't support extensions like Gmail yet, it offers ten new voice options, and more features are promised soon.
