### Research & Innovation

[### Text Classification with LLMs (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10523v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The Smart Expert System is a new approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) for text classification. This system streamlines the process by reducing the need for extensive preprocessing and domain expertise.

[### Dictionary Learning on Claude Sonnet (35 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic has made a breakthrough in mechanistic interpretability by mapping millions of concepts inside of Sonnet. It even found that you could push on the internal concepts and change Sonnet's sense of self (e.g., researchers made it believe it was the Golden Gate Bridge).

[### Phi-3 14B (Hugging Face Hub)](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct?utm_source=tldrai)

The powerful small series of models got an upgrade with the 14B version. It performs on par with Command R (a 104B model).

### Engineering & Resources

[### OctoAI outperforms vLLM for self-hosted GenAI (Sponsor)](https://octo.ai/blog/acceleration-is-all-you-need-techniques-powering-octostacks-10x-performance-boost/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=octostack-perf)

Open source LLMs like Llama 3 and Mixtral are game-changing. But getting them to run efficiently on vLLM requires a ton of manual optimizations. [OctoStack](https://octo.ai/blog/acceleration-is-all-you-need-techniques-powering-octostacks-10x-performance-boost/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=octostack-perf) from OctoAI achieves better throughput, lower latency, and efficient GPU utilization by baking the latest optimization techniques into an inference stack you control.

[### Enhanced Video Summarization (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/thswodnjs3/CSTA?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces a novel CNN-based SpatioTemporal Attention (CSTA) method to improve video summarization. Unlike traditional attention mechanisms, CSTA effectively captures the visual significance of frames using a 2D CNN to understand relationships and key attributes in videos.

[### Debiasing Vision-Language Models (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/yfzhang114/llava-align?utm_source=tldrai)

This project identifies a critical bias in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where outputs lean more towards language model priors than actual visual inputs. The project effectively reduces this bias by introducing "calibration" and "debias sampling" techniques, leading to more accurate and vision-focused responses across various tasks.

[### A Vision-Language Model for Real-World Applications (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-vl?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepSeek-VL is a new open-source Vision-Language Model tailored for real-world uses with an emphasis on diverse data from web screenshots to charts and OCR.

[### Ask HN: If you've used GPT-4-Turbo and Claude Opus, which do you prefer? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39735108&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

This Hacker News thread compares GPT-4-Turbo, the default model in ChatGPT Plus, to Claude Opus, Anthropic's competing model. Most developers seem to prefer Claude as it is apparently better at coding and engineering work. Its writing style also seems to be preferred, but part of that is due to the recognizability of GPT-4-Turbo's style. OpenAI's app functionalities, like its code interpreter and ability to search the internet, are still big reasons to continue using ChatGPT Plus.
