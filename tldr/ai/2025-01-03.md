### Research & Innovation

[### An analytic theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models (21 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20292?utm_source=tldrai)

A fascinating paper that explores closed form equations that can model generated images from diffusion models. This means that with a high degree of confidence you can predict the image that will be generated, in a simpler setting.

[### Centaur: a foundation model of human cognition (45 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20268?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have trained a language-like model that can predict cognitive reactions in human participants better than an MRI. This can be used to continue study in behavioral science and neuroscience.

[### Parallel Genetic Algorithm (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20980v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study suggests a method for reconstructing the genetic operation and designing a development framework for efficient parallel acceleration.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Dynamic 3D Gaussian Tracking for Graph-Based Neural Dynamics Modeling (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/robo-alex/gs-dynamics?utm_source=tldrai)

This code uses advances in general 3D vision techniques to improve the niche of robot vision. Specifically, it can predict the dynamics of objects being manipulated by a robotic arm which then in turn improves the system's overall manipulation performance.

[### Process Reinforcement Through Implicit Rewards (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/PRIME-RL/PRIME?utm_source=tldrai)

There are very few promising open replications of o1 reasoning. This work is quite promising in that it uses implicit rewards that don't require a formal reward method or model, but also rewards the outcome which is inline with what we know about reasoning models. The code is in progress, but its developers have released the data and models.

[### Single Modality 3D Object Detection (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/zcablii/sm3det?utm_source=tldrai)

This repository contains a 3D object detection framework designed for single modality inputs, particularly catering to simplified and efficient scenarios.
