[### Decoding Biases in Large Language Models (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07378?utm_source=tldrai)

Understanding how AI language models react to slight changes in their inputs is vital for ensuring fairness and usefulness, but it's not an easy task. A new method called Contrastive Input Decoding (CID) has been introduced to shed light on these subtle differences by generating text that reflects the unique characteristics of two slightly different inputs, thus making the AI's responses more understandable and manageable.

[### RL4F: Improving AI Performance with Collaborative Feedback (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08844?utm_source=tldrai)

RL4F is a new method that uses a smaller, critique-generating AI to help a much larger AI like GPT-3 fix its mistakes, much like how humans improve from feedback. By studying different tasks like planning, summarizing, and alphabetizing, researchers found that this approach improved the big AI's performance by about 5% on average.

[### Can foundation models label data like humans? (18 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/llm-leaderboard?utm_source=tldrai)

The recent hype in language models has led to statements like "our model is preferred to ChatGPT N% of the time". This statement usually hides the fact that GPT4 was the model doing the preferring. Wrapped up in that is all sorts of questions about calibration, reliability, and the plain fact that GPT4 prefers models that output more tokens per response. This blog dives into these details and the Open LLM leaderboard.
