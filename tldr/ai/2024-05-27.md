Silicon Valley AI firms are fighting to partner with Character.ai, a fast-growing role-playing startup founded by AI pioneer Noam Shazeer. This comes as many large firms are pouring money into smaller companies.

[### Scarlett Johansson told OpenAI not to use her voice (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24161253/scarlett-johansson-openai-altman-legal-action?utm_source=tldrai)

Scarlett Johansson alleges that OpenAI created a voice for ChatGPT that mimics hers without consent, leading her to seek legal advice. OpenAI has since paused using the voice and is discussing the issue with her representatives. The situation highlights concerns over the use of celebrity likenesses in AI applications.

[### Golden Gate Claude (2 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/golden-gate-claude?utm_source=tldrai)

A new research paper details the mapping of AI model Claude 3 Sonnet's inner workings, revealing "features" activated by concepts like the Golden Gate Bridge. By adjusting these features' strengths, researchers can direct Claude's responses to incorporate specific elements, demonstrating a novel method of modifying large language models. The research aims to enhance AI safety by precisely adjusting model behaviors related to potential risks.

[### Reinforcement Learning at Lyft (21 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13810?utm_source=tldrai)

The Lyft team used online reinforcement learning, rewarded by driver future earnings, to match drivers with riders. They were able to dramatically improve in real time and made an estimated $30m/year extra for riders.

[### Lessons on Reproducible Evaluation of Language Models (45 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14782?utm_source=tldrai)

Evaluating language models is hard and details on how to do it are hard to find outside of the largest firms. This paper shows a reproducible and powerful set of evaluation criteria. It includes a valuable discussion of perplexity evaluation in the appendix.

[### Image Personalization with Classifier-Guided Diffusion Models (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14677v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers introduce a new approach to customize diffusion models for generating identity-preserving images from user-provided references. Unlike traditional methods that require extensive domain-specific training, this technique uses classifier guidance to steer diffusion models without additional training.
