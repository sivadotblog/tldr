### Headlines & Launches

[### SoftBank's Intel AI processor plans in doubt as insiders say it is now considering a TSMC partnership (3 minute read)](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/softbanks-intel-ai-processor-plans-in-doubt-as-insiders-say-it-is-now-considering-a-tsmc-partnership?utm_source=tldrai)

Intel failed to produce AI processors for SoftBank's Project Izanagi, leading SoftBank to explore a partnership with TSMC. Despite setbacks, SoftBank remains committed to challenging major AI players with its own hardware and data center ecosystem, potentially backed by significant investment from global partners. The move could strain SoftBank's relationship with Arm clients as it risks direct competition.

[### Nouse Hermes 3 (5 minute read)](https://nousresearch.com/hermes3/?utm_source=tldrai)

Nous Research has released its flagship model. Trained on top of Llama 3, the model has strong performance and a great personality like many of the company's original models.

[### California AI bill SB 1047 aims to prevent AI disasters, but Silicon Valley warns it will cause one (8 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/15/california-ai-bill-sb-1047-aims-to-prevent-ai-disasters-but-silicon-valley-warns-it-will-cause-one/)

California's SB 1047, designed to prevent "critical harms" from large AI models, faces pushback from Silicon Valley, with stakeholders divided over its potential impact on innovation. Major industry figures and companies debate the bill's merits and consequences on AI development and safety. The bill, which requires AI model safety protocols and third-party audits, with enforcement and hefty fines outlined for non-compliance, is heading to a final Senate vote.

### Research & Innovation

[### Mutual Reasoning makes small models smarter (34 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06195?utm_source=tldrai)

Tree search is an extremely active area of research for inference time computation for language models. This paper from Microsoft shows a particularly compelling case that enables small models to improve dramatically on mathematics problems.

[### Anchored Preference Optimization (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06266?utm_source=tldrai)

Tuning models to align with human preferences usually requires some post training. However, when training these models it is not clear why one example is better than another. APO is a way for models to degrade existing examples and then use that degraded example to anchor the difference in preference.

[### Semantic Segmentation with MetaSeg (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07576v1?utm_source=tldrai)

MetaSeg is a powerful semantic segmentation network built on the MetaFormer architecture that enhances both the backbone and decoder of the network.

[### Brands should avoid ‚ÄúAI‚Äù (3 minute read)](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/10/business/brands-avoid-term-customers/index.html?utm_source=tldrai)

A recent study found that labeling products as "AI-powered" can decrease consumer intent to purchase due to trust issues and fears of the unknown. The research suggests that both cognitive and emotional trust are factors, with people wary of AI's inner workings and risks, especially regarding personal data privacy. Companies are advised to focus on clear messaging about AI benefits rather than using "AI" as a buzzword.
