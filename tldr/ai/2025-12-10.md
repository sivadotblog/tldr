### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI testing new Image-2 models on LM Arena (2 minute read)](https://www.testingcatalog.com/openai-testing-new-image-2-models-on-lm-arena/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is preparing to roll out its next generation of image generation models along with GPT-5.2. Two new models have appeared on online evaluation platforms. Early testers note a substantial increase in image detail and fidelity. The upgrade brings OpenAI's image generation closer to the standard set by Google Nano Banana 2. Examples of images generated with the models are available in the article.

[### GLM-4.6V: Open Source Multimodal Models with Native Tool Use (7 minute read)](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.6v?utm_source=tldrai)

GLM-4.6V (106B), a foundation model designed for cloud and high-performance cluster scenarios, and GLM-4.6V-Flash (9B), a lightweight model optimized for local deployment and low-latency applications, have been open-sourced. GLM-4.6V scales its context window to 128k tokens in training. It achieves SoTA performance in visual understanding and reasoning among models of similar parameter scales. The model has native Function Calling capabilities.

[### Introducing Devstral2 and Mistral Vibe CLI (5 minute read)](https://mistral.ai/news/devstral-2-vibe-cli?utm_source=tldrai)

Devstral 2 hits 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified with 123B parameters, making it one of the best open-weight coding models despite being a fraction of the size of its peers. The 24B Devstral Small 2 scores 68.0% and runs on consumer hardware. Mistral also launched Vibe CLI, an open-source terminal agent that orchestrates multi-file changes across codebases.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### How People Use AI at Work (12 minute read)](https://dejan.ai/blog/report-ai-workplace/?utm_source=tldrai)

Professionals use AI for grunt work and first drafts. It is never trusted without supervision. Artists use AI to handle admin work so they have more time for creative work. Researchers find that the time required to fact-check AI output often negates the efficiency gains. The primary barrier to AI adoption is hallucination.

[### 2025: The State of Generative AI in the Enterprise (32 minute read)](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/?utm_source=tldrai)

The shift to enterprise AI is no longer speculative. Enterprise AI is now a $37 billion market. It is the fastest-scaling category in software history. AI is becoming the core of how work gets done across industries, and enterprises, seeing real returns, are doubling down.

[### There is no data-generating distribution (8 minute read)](https://www.argmin.net/p/there-is-no-data-generating-distribution?utm_source=tldrai)

The data-generating distribution is a convenient mnemonic crutch for machine learning engineers. However, it isn't necessary for understanding machine learning. The same methods are used regardless of whether the world is producing randomness. We need to figure out when we actually need statistical models of data.

[### How People Use AI Agents (7 minute read)](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/how-people-use-ai-agents?utm_source=tldrai)

A large-scale usage study from Perplexity and Harvard reveals that over half of AI agent tasks involve deep cognitive work like research and productivity, challenging the stereotype of agents as simple task-doers.
