[### Together Mixture Of Agents (7 minute read)](https://www.together.ai/blog/together-moa?utm_source=tldrai)

Together has introduced Mixture of Agents (MoA), a novel method that combines multiple LLMs for superior performance that achieves a 65.1% score on AlpacaEval 2.0, surpassing GPT-4o. MoA uses a layered structure where initial responses from various models are refined by aggregators in successive layers, enhancing output quality through collaboration. Despite higher accuracy, MoA faces latency challenges. Future directions include optimizing model architecture and reducing latency.
