### Headlines & Launches

[### Apple cancels self-driving car project (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084907/apple-electric-car-project-titan-shuts-down?utm_source=tldrai)

After a decade of effort and billions of dollars, Apple is canceling its unsuccessful attempt at building a car to rival Tesla. Many of the employees are expected to move to generative AI projects.

[### Berkeley function calling leaderboard (12 minute read)](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/8_berkeley_function_calling_leaderboard.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Function calling is when a language model can access tools via synthesized functions to complete its given instructions. This requires proper synthesis of arguments to pass to those functions. This leaderboard is designed to assess model capability on function calling tasks.

### Research & Innovation

[### ChatMusician (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16153?utm_source=tldrai)

Music understanding typically relies on adding a modality-specific encoder to a language model. This is expensive and unstable. This work found that music understanding increased substantially without impact to base language ability when music was tokenized into ABC notation.

[### Information Retrieval with Advanced Reranking (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15838v1?utm_source=tldrai)

ListT5 introduces a cutting-edge reranking method that not only improves the precision of information retrieval but also offers an efficient solution to the challenges faced by previous listwise rerankers.

[### MegaScale (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15627?utm_source=tldrai)

Bytedance has produced a system called MegaScale that can be used to train massively parallel large language models. It succeeded in training a 175B LLM on 12,288 GPUs with 55.2% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU), which is extremely impressive. Bytedance plans to open source some aspects of the codebase.
