### Headlines & Launches

[### Transformers JS v3 (16 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/transformersjs-v3?utm_source=tldrai)

Transformers JS is a JavaScript library for running models. It now uses WebGPU, which is up to 1,000x faster in some cases. The new version has 1,200+ models ready to use for edge and browser-based applications.

[### Simplifying, Stabilizing, and Scaling Consistency Models (12 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/simplifying-stabilizing-and-scaling-continuous-time-consistency-models/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has released some work discussing improvements to consistency models (which generate in two steps as opposed to 1,000 for diffusion). They still rely on distillation from an existing diffusion model, but this work aims to improve and stabilize them as they scale.

[### DeepMind Open Sources SynthID (8 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/synthid-text?utm_source=tldrai)

SynthID is a way to statistically watermark generated text. It uses a pseudorandom function after top-k and top-p in the sampling process to mark text. Then you can use a probabilistic bayesian method to detect if text has been watermarked - meaning it was generated by a language model.
