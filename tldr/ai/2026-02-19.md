How can you best use AI to build better software? In 2026, this is the question on everyone's mind. At the [Sonar Summit virtual conference](https://events.sonarsource.com/the-sonar-summit/?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=ss-sonar-summit26&utm_content=newsletter-tldr-primary-sonarsummit-26-260219-x&utm_term=ww-psp-x&s_category=Paid&s_source=Paid%20Other&s_origin=tldr), you'll get to hear answers from some of the most respected voices in tech.

This event will grapple with the reality of AI writing the majority of new code and what it means for teams, with featured speakers including:

* Gergely Orosz (The Pragmatic Engineer),
* Santiago Valdarrama, AWS AI Hero
* Laura Tacho (CTO at DX, co-author of the Core 4 developer productivity framework).
* And many others - [see the full agenda](https://events.sonarsource.com/the-sonar-summit/?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=ss-sonar-summit26&utm_content=newsletter-tldr-seeagenda-sonarsummit-26-260219-x&utm_term=ww-psp-x&s_category=Paid&s_source=Paid%20Other&s_origin=tldr)!

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Improving Deep Agents with Harness Engineering (8 minute read)](https://x.com/Vtrivedy10/status/2023805578561060992?utm_source=tldrai)

LangChain's coding agent went from Top 30 to Top 5 on Terminal Bench 2.0 with just a harness change. This post discusses the team's approach to harness engineering. The goal of a harness is to mold the intelligence of a model for tasks you care about. Self-verification and tracing help a lot.

[### Prompt Caching 201 (10 minute read)](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/prompt_caching_201?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI published a detailed guide explaining how prompt caching reuses repeated prompt prefixes to skip prefill compute, reducing latency and input token costs. It outlines cache mechanics, routing considerations, KV reuse, and practical strategies for increasing cache hit rates in production workloads.

[### On Universe, Life, and AI (3 minute read)](https://x.com/ivanhzhao/status/2024083641685385324?utm_source=tldrai)

Ivan Zhao frames AI as the latest “tool of life” after language, markets, and the internet. Humanity uses culture, capital, and computation to impose its values on an indifferent universe, and AI extends this by accelerating idea discovery and coordination. In this view, AI is not separate from life but a continuation of life organizing matter and energy through intelligence.

Give it a question, and it gets to work: Subagents deeply interrogate your topic, scour a wide range of credible sources, and package it all up into [boardroom-ready reports, slides, docs, or websites](https://www.superagent.com/?utm_ID=recN0X1nG7xY8JFQL&utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paidnewsletter&utm_campaign=superagentlaunchairtable&utm_content=secondary).

[### Google Proposes Random Masking for LLM Optimization (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15322?utm_source=tldrai)

Google researchers showed that randomly masking parameter updates can outperform dense adaptive optimizers, with a masked RMSProp variant exceeding recent state-of-the-art methods. Their proposed Magma optimizer uses momentum-aligned gradient masking to improve pre-training efficiency.

[### Introducing EVMbench (6 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/introducing-evmbench/?utm_source=tldrai)

EVMbench is a benchmark that evaluates the ability of AI agents to detect, patch, and exploit high-severity smart contract vulnerabilities. Smart contracts routinely secure hundreds of billions of dollars in crypto assets. As AI agents improve, it becomes increasingly important to measure their capabilities in economically meaningful environments. This also means using AI systems to defensively audit and strengthen deployed contracts.

[### GLM-5 Technical Report (42 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15763?utm_source=tldrai)

GLM-5 technical report outlines the details of the model development, combining DSA-based efficiency improvements with asynchronous reinforcement learning to decouple generation from training.
