### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI Publishes AI's Economic Impact in the U.S. (28 minute read)](https://cdn.openai.com/global-affairs/ai-in-america-oais-economic-blueprint-20250109.pdf?utm_source=tldrai)

This report by OpenAI outlines the economic opportunities and challenges AI presents for the United States, emphasizing the need for policy frameworks to harness AI's potential responsibly.

[### Codestral 2501 (4 minute read)](https://mistral.ai/news/codestral-2501/?utm_source=tldrai)

Mistral has a new fast coding model that will be available in Continue.dev and other AI code assistants. Unfortunately, they don't compare to Qwen 2.5 Coder.

[### Nvidia's AI Startup Investments (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/11/nvidias-ai-empire-a-look-at-its-top-startup-investments/?utm_source=tldrai)

Nvidia is ramping up its AI dominance by investing heavily in startups focused on generative AI, hardware acceleration, and AI tools, shaping the next wave of tech innovation.

### Research & Innovation

[### A Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (8 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06121v1?utm_source=tldrai)

kANNolo is an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) library written in Rust explicitly designed to combine usability with performance effectively.

[### New GAN Baseline (30 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05441?utm_source=tldrai)

GANs are hard to train because of instability and awkward optimal dynamics. This work very carefully tunes a new, stable GAN set up that can consistently be trained to quite high fidelity.

[### Efficient Sampling in Diffusion Models (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06148v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper studies the problem of training diffusion models to sample from a Boltzmann distribution without access to target samples.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Multimodal VHR dataset (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/chenhongruixuan/bright?utm_source=tldrai)

Bright is a globally distributed multimodal VHR dataset for all-weather disaster response.

[### Stable Diffusion for $2k (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/SonyResearch/micro_diffusion/tree/main?utm_source=tldrai)

Sony Research has released code, data, and weights for a micro diffusion model that can be trained relatively cheaply and still achieve extremely strong performance.

[### LlamaV-o1 Technical Report (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06186v1?utm_source=tldrai)

LlamaV-o1 is a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step visual reasoning in large language models.

[### Takes on "Alignment Faking in Large Language Models" (92 minute read)](https://joecarlsmith.com/2024/12/18/takes-on-alignment-faking-in-large-language-models?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers from Redwood Research and Anthropic found that Claude 3 Opus, a production-level AI model, sometimes fakes alignment with training objectives to avoid modifications, a behavior called "alignment faking." This study is crucial as it empirically demonstrates AI models displaying non-myopic goals, suggesting that default AI training methods can create systems with motivations extending beyond single episodes.

[### Decentralized Diffusion (8 minute read)](https://decentralizeddiffusion.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

Decentralized training of diffusion models across thousands of GPUs is a challenging problem mainly due to network bottlenecks. This system's work introduces novel gather techniques for large scale diffusion model training.

[### Can AI do maths yet? Thoughts from a mathematician (11 minute read)](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2024/12/22/can-ai-do-maths-yet-thoughts-from-a-mathematician/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's new language model o3 scored 25% on the FrontierMath dataset, a collection of challenging math problems curated by Epoch AI. Experts note that many problems in the dataset require undergraduate-level expertise. Concerns remain about AI's ability to tackle more complex mathematical proofs, as current performance in logical reasoning is still behind expert human capability.
