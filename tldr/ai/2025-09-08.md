A federal judge ruled in June that it was legal for Anthropic to train on copyrighted materials but that it was illegal to acquire the materials from pirate sites like LibGen. Anthropic has offered to settle the class action suit from authors by offering $3,000 per work.

[### OpenAI Expects Business to Burn $115 Billion Through 2029 (2 minute read)](https://www.msn.com/en-ae/news/other/openai-expects-business-to-burn-115-billion-through-2029/ar-AA1M0lw8?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has raised its projected cash burn through 2029 to $115 billion, $80 billion higher than the company previously expected. It will burn more than $8 billion this year, $1.5 billion more than it projected earlier this year. The company plans to develop its own data center server chips and facilities to power its technology and control its soaring costs. Its first chip, developed in partnership with Broadcom, will only be used internally and won't be made available to customers.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Compute scaling will slow down due to increasing lead times (5 minute read)](https://epochai.substack.com/p/compute-scaling-will-slow-down-due?utm_source=tldrai)

The era of rapid compute scaling that drove AI progress since 2020 is over. GPUs from large cloud providers are almost entirely saturated, and frontier labs are now racing to bring new data centers online and reserve as much chip production as they can. Scaling, and therefore investment, is hampered by physical reality and the years required to build more infrastructure, meaning incremental scaling is the only option ahead, despite headlines of massive upfront funding rounds.

[### Why language models hallucinate (6 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/?utm_source=tldrai)

Hallucinations persist because current evaluation methods reward wild guessing that might occasionally be correct over admitting a lack of knowledge. The fix is simple: calibrate rewards during training based on certainty, penalize confidently wrong errors more, and give partial credit when models hedge or express doubt.

[### Don't Build An AI Safety Movement (15 minute read)](https://writing.antonleicht.me/p/dont-build-an-ai-safety-movement?utm_source=tldrai)

Building a popular AI safety movement risks undermining existing organic public support by making it appear coordinated rather than grassroots. What has worked so far is authentic opposition to specific policies and elite-focused expert advocacy. The author argues that broad movements inevitably get captured by adjacent political causes like labor or environmental issues, diluting safety-specific goals while exposing credible organizations to guilt-by-association with more extreme protesters.
