### Headlines & Launches

[### Intel shows off first fully integrated optical compute interconnect, designed to scale up AI workloads (4 minute read)](https://siliconangle.com/2024/06/26/intel-shows-off-first-fully-integrated-optical-compute-interconnect-designed-scale-ai-workloads/?utm_source=tldrai)

Intel has presented the industry's first fully integrated optical compute interconnect (OCI) chiplet designed to significantly boost high-bandwidth data interconnect performance. Essential for growing AI demands, the milestone represents a step forward in silicon photonics, combining integrated circuits with lasers to enhance data transfer rates and support AI infrastructure scaling. The OCI chiplet aims to overcome the limitations of current electrical I/O interconnects by enabling higher bandwidth and longer-distance data transmission.

[### LLM101n: Let's build a Storyteller (2 minute read)](https://github.com/karpathy/LLM101n?utm_source=tldrai)

Andrej Karpathy announced a new course that guides learners in building a Storyteller AI Large Language Model from scratch. It covers the fundamentals of web app implementation using Python, C, and CUDA. The content spans language modeling, deep learning frameworks, and AI deployment including multimodal applications.

[### How Big Tech is swallowing the AI industry (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/1/24190060/amazon-adept-ai-acquisition-playbook-microsoft-inflection?utm_source=tldrai)

Amazon has hired most of Adept's team, another aspiring OpenAI competitor, and licensed its technology, following a pattern that mirrors Microsoft's acquisition approach with Inflection. This move reflects a trend where big tech companies absorb AI talent and innovations without formal acquisitions to navigate antitrust scrutiny. Such strategies may become commonplace as the AI industry faces consolidation and high development costs.

### Miscellaneous

[### Contra Acemoglu on AI (6 minute read)](https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/contra-acemoglu-on-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

Economist Daron Acemoglu's working paper on AI suggests a modest 0.06% annual increase in TFP growth, challenging more optimistic forecasts. He distinguishes AI's productivity impact through four channels but discounts deepening of automation and creation of new labor-intensive products, arguably underestimating AI's full economic potential. Critics find his approach overly narrow, potentially misrepresenting the broader macroeconomic implications of AI advancements.

[### Boosting Smartphone Camera Clarity (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/cszhilu1998/selfdzsr_plusplus?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces a method for enhancing image resolution on smartphones using a self-supervised learning model that improves reference-based super-resolution (RefSR).

[### Speech Enhancement with SEMamba (8 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06573v1?utm_source=tldrai)

SEMamba is a new speech enhancement system that leverages the Mamba state-space model to improve the clarity of speech signals.
