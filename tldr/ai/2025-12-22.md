Many financial systems of record (like ERP) were built at a time when AI tools were the stuff of science fiction. Now, they need to work together.

On the latest episode of [Unpack Pricing](https://metronome.com/podcast/unpack-pricing/why-ai-demands-a-new-approach-to-financial-systems-of-record?utm_campaign=unpack-pricing-podcast&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_content=), Metronome CEO Scott Woody talks with Rillet CEO Nicolas Kopp about why old financial systems often have a "garbage in, garbage out" problem for modern companies running AI.

They get into [why gen AI is famously bad with numbers](https://metronome.com/podcast/unpack-pricing/why-ai-demands-a-new-approach-to-financial-systems-of-record?utm_campaign=unpack-pricing-podcast&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_content=) (and where it actually helps), why 20 years of finance experience might now be a hiring red flag, and how one customer went from six-month pricing changes to two-hour launches.

[### Evaluating Context Compression for AI Agents (10 minute read)](https://factory.ai/news/evaluating-compression?utm_source=tldrai)

What happens when agents run out of memory determines whether they continue productively or have to start from scratch. This post explores an evaluation framework that measures how much context different compression strategies preserve. Structured summarization retains more useful information than alternative methods without sacrificing compression efficiency.

[### Understanding AI Benchmarks (25 minute read)](https://blog.sshh.io/p/understanding-ai-benchmarks?utm_source=tldrai)

Benchmarks are the most widely misunderstood part of the AI ecosystem. The narrative keeps implying a universal increase in intelligence, but the numbers can be misleading. To navigate this noise, look at the aggregate, look at the relative, and verify with your own tasks. The only benchmark that matters at the end of the day is your own workload.

[### The changing drivers of LLM adoption (15 minute read)](https://epochai.substack.com/p/the-changing-drivers-of-llm-adoption?utm_source=tldrai)

LLM use is rising. People are increasingly using different LLMs, different products, and in different places. ChatGPT remains dominant and keeps acquiring new users, but Gemini's growth has been faster over the last few months. OpenAI's revenue seems to be on track, but consumer revenue is likely decreasing as a share. A substantial share of workplace AI use involves workers adopting tools on their own rather than waiting for employer-provided access.

[### Experiment Diary (3 minute read)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sm-XUZ4MvYHcOw7gsoIpdEu38GhCpgNCMnx6Fa0grks/edit?tab=t.3awwxw6mhl75#heading=h.xy9wi236lxm&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

This document contains a diary for an experiment aimed at teaching an LLM using GRPO to generate regex given a description. It details the performance, learnings, modifications, and key takeaways from each experiment. The initial training run was on December 17. It saw the model quickly learning how to generate valid regex tags, but the model was basically generating random regex strings.

[### How to game the METR plot (9 minute read)](https://shash42.substack.com/p/how-to-game-the-metr-plot?utm_source=tldrai)

METR topics are public, making it easy to game METR horizon length measurements for a frontier lab. The horizon length under METR's assumptions might be adding little information beyond benchmark accuracy. There is a meme going around based on a team achieving a one to four hour range on the METR plot. This post explains why the plot has been interpreted incorrectly.
