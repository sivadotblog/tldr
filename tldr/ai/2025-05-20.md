### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Jensen Huang on Global AI Strategy and Chip Controls (28 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-about-chip-controls-ai-factories-and-enterprise-pragmatism/?utm_source=tldrai)

Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, argues that America's chip export restrictions are ‚Äúexactly wrong‚Äù as they force China to build competing AI ecosystems while causing American companies to lose revenue. Specifically, Huang estimated that Nvidia wrote off $5.5 billion in inventory and forfeited $15 billion in Chinese sales. Huang predicts AI will expand beyond IT into manufacturing and operations, creating a much larger market where enterprises will pay "$100,000 a year" for AI workers to address labor shortages.

[### How far can reasoning models scale? (8 minute read)](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-far-can-reasoning-models-scale?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's o3 reasoning model has rapidly improved but may soon reach scaling limits. Current reasoning models like o3 could quickly converge with overall training compute growth (~4√ó per year) after initial rapid scaling. There are concerns about data constraints and generalizability, but researchers remain optimistic about continued advancements in reasoning capabilities.
