The personality of Microsoft‚Äôs Bing AI is an interesting one. In conversations it can be seen insulting users, gaslighting them, and even claiming to spy on Microsoft developers through their webcams. Thankfully, most people find this behavior amusing‚Ä¶for now.

[### writeGPT is your everyday writing assistant (3 minute read)](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/writegpt?utm_source=tldrai)

writeGPT is designed to overcome unproductive browsing habits by plugging ChatGPT capabilities on any website and search engine while facilitating effective prompt engineering to read, write, rewrite, reply to emails, code, and research any content.

[### Human Writer or AI? Scholars Build a Detection Tool (5 minute read)](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/human-writer-or-ai-scholars-build-detection-tool?utm_source=tldrai)

The article discusses the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities, raising concerns about the need for oversight to protect against potential misuse. Eric Anthony Mitchell, a computer science graduate student at Stanford University, is developing an infrastructure that would provide guardrails around LLMs, including a tool called DetectGPT. DetectGPT distinguishes between human- and LLM-generated text and accurately identifies authorship 95% of the time in initial experiments.

### Research & Innovation

[### Evolutionary algorithm discovers optimizer that outperforms Adam (45 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06675?utm_source=tldrai)

Adam has been the workhorse for AI optimization since its release. Recent advances in AutoML from Google have shown that simpler mathematical functions might be discovered by computers for use by humans! This work is one such example where a simple optimizer was discovered that has a reduced memory footprint. It improves model performance up to 2% and works well at high batch sizes (e.g., Large Language Model training regime). There‚Äôs even code provided.

[### A universal guidance for diffusion models (7 minute read)](https://github.com/arpitbansal297/universal-guided-diffusion?utm_source=tldrai)

This work suggests a universal guidance algorithm that enables diffusion models to be controlled by arbitrary guidance modalities without retraining. The article shows that the algorithm successfully generates quality images with various guidance functions, including in segmentation, face recognition, object detection, and classifier signals.

[### Unleashing the Power of ChatGPT: Can it Master Natural Language Tasks on Its Own? Findings from a Comprehensive Study (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06476?utm_source=tldrai)

The paper presents an empirical analysis of ChatGPT's ability to perform multiple natural language processing tasks without adaptation on downstream data. The authors evaluate ChatGPT on 20 NLP datasets and find that the model performs well on tasks that require reasoning but struggles with tasks like sequence tagging. The article includes in-depth analysis through qualitative case studies.

[### From Bing to Sydney, Search As Distraction, Sentient AI (10 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2023/from-bing-to-sydney-search-as-distraction-sentient-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

Author Ben Thompson argues that OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Bard technology is less about creating better search and more about manifesting the movie Her in chat form. This might be the next step beyond social media, where consumers are not just getting content from their network (Facebook, LinkedIn) or a service (YouTube, Tiktok), but getting content tailored just for them.

[### AI Drug Development (12 minute read)](https://archive.ph/avRlJ?utm_source=tldrai)

AI is enabling the design of revolutionary new drugs previously thought to be impossible. Now, scientists have to test the effectiveness of these drugs.

[### Can ChatGPT-like Generative Models Guarantee Factual Accuracy? (8 minute read)](https://dev.to/ruochenzhao3/can-chatgpt-like-generative-models-guarantee-factual-accuracy-on-the-mistakes-of-microsofts-new-bing-111b?utm_source=tldrai)

Bing AI doesn‚Äôt always know what it‚Äôs talking about. This blog post dives into all the factual mistakes from Microsoft‚Äôs new Bing AI search demo video, including fabricated financial reports to inaccurate product descriptions. It also goes into mistakes made in Google‚Äôs Bard demo and compares the two AIs.
