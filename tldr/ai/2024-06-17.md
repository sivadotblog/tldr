### Headlines & Launches

[### AI will make money sooner than you'd think (54 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/24173858/ai-cohere-aidan-gomez-money-revenue-llm-transformers-enterprise-stochastic-parrot?utm_source=tldrai)

This article contains a transcript of an interview with Aidan Gomez, CEO of Cohere, where he discusses Cohere's path to profitability, the benefit of competition in the enterprise space, AI's current abilities, the future of large language models, and more.

[### Nvidia launches GPT-4 quality model (8 minute read)](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nemotron-4-synthetic-data-generation-llm-training/?utm_source=tldrai)

NVIDIA's Nemotron-4 340B is a family of open models that developers can use to generate synthetic data for training LLMs for commercial applications. The state-of-the-art reward model matches the original GPT-4 model and can run on 8 H100s.

[### Apple to ‚ÄòPay' OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash (5 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/apple-to-pay-openai-for-chatgpt-through-distribution-not-cash?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxODIzODgyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzE4ODQzNjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRVhOTjlUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.Ger9daQzJU8oCPduPpYyIv09c-rH3LP0NnsfH5mYCSo&amp;utm_source=tldrai)

Apple and OpenAI's partnership isn't expected to generate meaningful revenue for either party, at least at the beginning. Apple believes that pushing OpenAI's brand and technology to its devices is of equal or greater value than monetary payments so it isn't paying OpenAI as part of the deal. The deal isn't exclusive - Apple is already discussing offering other chatbots as additional options. Apple eventually plans to make money from AI by striking revenue-sharing agreements with AI partners.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Llama 3 8B matches GPT 4 math performance with MCTS (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/trotsky1997/MathBlackBox?utm_source=tldrai)

The current Holy Grail of research is figuring out how to integrate search into language model generation. This work is extremely promising and shows that small models with search can match much more powerful models on math performance.

[### Video Understanding with VideoGPT+ (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/videogpt-plus?utm_source=tldrai)

VideoGPT+ is a model that combines image and video encoders to enhance video understanding. Image encoders capture detailed spatial information, while video encoders provide temporal context.

Aiyana Rainbow, a Romanian AI model, is a finalist in the inaugural Miss AI pageant, an event that features AI-generated models on social media. Organized by FanVue, the event is part of "The FanVue World AI Creator Awards," which showcases AI creators' ability to generate engaging content without being the physical face themselves. The winner of Miss AI is set to receive $5,000, public relations support, and mentorship. The results will be announced at the end of June.

[### Nvidia's New Sales Booster: The Global Push for National AI Champions (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidias-new-sales-booster-the-global-push-for-domestic-ai-champions-6d005ab7?st=3t4jukdsg9da2bt&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrai)

Governments around the world are boosting their budgets to encourage companies and multinationals to build new data centers and refit old ones to develop AI locally and train large language models in their native languages based on their own citizens' data. Nvidia says that these sovereign AI efforts are expected to bring in almost $10 billion this year. Many governments are concerned about how generative AI will impact their economies. They want sovereign clouds for their AI infrastructure and sensitive data, and US tech companies are eager to build those for them.
