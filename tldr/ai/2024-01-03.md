### Headlines & Launches

[### Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot app is now available on iOS (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/29/24019288/microsoft-copilot-app-available-iphone-ipad-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft has rolled out its Copilot AI chatbot app for iOS and iPadOS. The app allows users to access GPT-4 without paying for a subscription and ask questions, draft emails, summarize text, and create images. Microsoft's rebrand of Bing Chat to Copilot shows that the company is moving towards offering a standalone experience similar to ChatGPT. There is also a web experience for Copilot that is separate from Bing.

[### Stuff we figured out about AI in 2023 (7 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/31/ai-in-2023?utm_source=tldrai)

This article attempts to round up the highlights in AI development over 2023. It covers how to run LLMs on personal devices, fine-tuning models, the problem of gullibility, LLM applications, and more. LLMs can provide people who use them effectively with a significant boost to their quality of life. They're actually quite easy to build, but there's still a lot unknown about them and they're still unreliable for many applications.

[### How IBM Sees AI Changing the game (4 minute read)](https://www.saastr.com/how-ai-is-changing-the-game-for-companies-with-ibm?utm_source=tldrai)

AI technology is transforming businesses in various industries. IBM‚Äôs VP of Software and Technology Raj Datta and Director of Startups Kylie Rutherford share in this article how AI is changing the game for companies of all sizes, presenting some use cases of various products.

### Research & Innovation

[### Images Altered To Trick Machine Vision Can Influence Humans Too (5 minute read)](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/images-altered-to-trick-machine-vision-can-influence-humans-too/?utm_source=tldrai)

Recent research reveals that subtle changes made to digital images to deceive AI vision systems can also influence human perception. While humans and AI perceive images differently, the study found that humans, under controlled conditions, can be systematically biased by adversarial perturbations designed to mislead AI.

[### Improving Text Embeddings with Large Language Models (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00368?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers at Microsoft used synthetic data to train a decoder-only transformer based on Mistral for embeddings. It is best in class. Interestingly, they use a two-step prompting strategy with GPT-4 to generate the synthetic retrieval training data.

[### MosaicBERT: A Bidirectional Encoder Optimized for Fast Pretraining (12 minute read)](https://mosaicbert.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

BERT is an Encoder-only Transformer. This means it is often used to represent natural language in the form of embeddings and isn‚Äôt usually used to generate text. Importantly, it was one of the first Transformers used in search because it can represent both the query and the information to be retrieved. The team at Mosaic has integrated FlashAttention, GLU, and many other innovations to dramatically improve pretraining speed (1 hour, $20) while matching the performance of much larger traditional BERT models.

Llamafile is a project that embeds the model and inference code into a single portable executable. This blog explores how to pipe command line output into the language model for further processing.

[### LLM Course (21 minute read)](https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-course?utm_source=tldrai)

A modern look at hot topics in the LLM space like merging, GGUF, quantization, DPO, and more. It is designed for beginners, scientists, and engineers to dive into the field and get up to speed quickly.

[### Unveiling Gemini's Potential: A Study of Multimodal Commonsense Reasoning (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/eternityyw/gemini-commonsense-evaluation?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces an in-depth analysis of Google's Gemini, a Multimodal Large Language Model, assessing its performance in common sense reasoning across various tasks. The study, which compares Gemini with other models, reveals its competitive abilities in integrating knowledge across modalities.

[### LLMs And Programming In The First Days Of 2024 (15 minute read)](http://antirez.com/news/140?utm_source=tldrai)

In 2023, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become invaluable for programmers, significantly accelerating code writing and understanding complex APIs or frameworks. While they have limitations in complex system programming, LLMs excel in high-level Python coding and mundane tasks, serving as an efficient tool for enhancing productivity and as a condensed form of documentation.

[### Single Image Super-Resolution with Improved Stability (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17526v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have developed a new method that improves single image super-resolution by focusing on two key aspects: the optimal centroid of potential high-resolution images and the inherent noise that affects image quality.
