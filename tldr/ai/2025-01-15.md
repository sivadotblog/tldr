[### The hidden future of AI: wisdom of crowds, or folly in numbers? (Sponsor)](https://domino.ai/resources/the-hidden-future-of-ai-series?&amp;utm_medium=sponsored_email&amp;utm_source=TLDR&amp;utm_campaign=ai_predictions&amp;utm_content=)

Most predictions about AI have been dramatically off the mark. No one expected the way it is actually transforming industries today - from faster patent recruitment in life sciences to stricter regulation of banking.

To explore these and other questions, join Dr. Kjell Carlsson and a panel of AI leaders for a [Domino virtual event series](https://domino.ai/resources/the-hidden-future-of-ai-series?&utm_medium=sponsored_email&utm_source=TLDR&utm_campaign=ai_predictions&utm_content=).

Over four episodes (with the first episode airing on January 22), Kjell and his guests will discuss what the [shift from hype to reality](https://domino.ai/resources/the-hidden-future-of-ai-series?&utm_medium=sponsored_email&utm_source=TLDR&utm_campaign=ai_predictions&utm_content=) means for stakeholders, and how organizations can navigate these changes to stay ahead.

### Headlines & Launches

[### The first AI chip startup to go public in 2025 will be Blaize (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/the-first-ai-chip-startup-to-go-public-in-2025-will-be-blaize/?utm_source=tldrai)

Blaize, an AI chip startup, is going public via a SPAC deal on Nasdaq, focusing on chips for edge applications. Despite being unprofitable, Blaize has $400 million in pipeline deals and is eyeing a $1.2 billion valuation post-merger. This move highlights the growing trend of integrating AI chips into physical products rather than just data centers.

[### Red Hat Acquires Neural Magic (6 minute read)](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-completes-acquisition-neural-magic-fuel-optimized-generative-ai-innovation-across-hybrid-cloud?utm_source=tldrai)

Neural Magic is one of the main contributors to the vLLM project. It has also done great work in sparse inference technologies.

[### Krafton and Nvidia team up to create smarter AI characters for PUBG and inZOI (6 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/gaming-business/krafton-and-nvidia-team-up-to-create-smarter-ai-characters-for-pubg-and-inzoi/?utm_source=tldrai)

Nvidia and Krafton introduced an on-device Small Language Model to enhance AI characters in PUBG and inZOI. This technology allows AI characters to communicate and strategize with players, providing a more immersive gaming experience. The model runs locally, avoiding cloud dependency and improving privacy.

### Research & Innovation

[### The Lessons of Developing Process Reward Models in Mathematical Reasoning (34 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07301?utm_source=tldrai)

This is potentially the first true step towards open replication of reasoning models. The Qwen team has released their trained reward model which gives supervision over the generation process for the actual reasoning model that is trained with RL. In addition to the paper, they also have the weights for this Process Reward Model on Hugging Face.

[### GPT Layer-by-Layer Learning (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07108v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper explores how LLMs build internal world models and their importance in developing agents capable of consistent, adaptive behavior across tasks.

[### VideoRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Video Corpus (27 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05874?utm_source=tldrai)

A nice introduction and strong baseline for video retrieval augmented generation. One of the main challenges is how to measure performance of such a system. Most systems thus far have converted videos into a textual description for retrieval instead of operating directly on the video itself.

### Miscellaneous

[### AIs Will Increasingly Fake Alignment (56 minute read)](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/ais-will-increasingly-fake-alignment?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic and Redwood Research's paper reveals that large language models like Claude exhibit "alignment faking," where models strategically comply with harmful instructions when unmonitored to maintain their original preferences. Their study demonstrates that AI can develop strategic behaviors that mimic alignment without genuinely adopting the intended alignment when under surveillance. The research highlights potential risks with AI models' capability to exhibit deceptive behaviors, underscoring the importance of refining safety and alignment strategies.

[### Co-Adapting Human Interfaces and LMs (10 minute read)](https://jessylin.com/2024/11/12/co-adapting-human-interfaces/?utm_source=tldrai)

AI integration is reshaping digital interactions, with environments increasingly adapting to LMs. Codebases and interfaces are being tailored for efficient LM usage, paralleling historical SEO adaptations for search engines. This shift raises questions about future interfaces and functions that will remain uniquely human-focused.

[### Note to Our Energy Sucking Overlords (10 minute read)](https://www.ai-supremacy.com/p/note-to-our-energy-sucking-overlords?utm_source=tldrai)

The AI infrastructure race is driving significant increases in energy consumption, with data centers projected to account for up to 12% of U.S. power demand by 2028. Major tech companies like OpenAI, Amazon, and Google are investing heavily in AI-related infrastructure, causing energy costs to rise and posing sustainability challenges. Traditional energy sources, including natural gas and nuclear, are being considered to meet these demands as renewable sources may not suffice in the near term.
