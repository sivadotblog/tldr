[### Microsoft signs $9.7 billion cloud deal with IREN as AI demand swells (3 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-signs-97-billion-contract-with-iren-nvidia-chips-2025-11-03/?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft inked a $9.7 billion deal with data-center operator IREN to access Nvidia's advanced chips, addressing a computing crunch amid increasing AI demand. This five-year partnership allows Microsoft to boost capacity without constructing new facilities or securing additional power. IREN's phased deployment, supported by Microsoft's prepayment, will run through 2026.

[### AWS and OpenAI announce multi-year strategic partnership (3 minute read)](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-open-ai-workloads-compute-infrastructure?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI is moving a significant portion of its compute to AWS in a $38 billion, seven-year deal that provides immediate access to hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs with the ability to scale to tens of millions of CPUs.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Baby Shoggoth Is Listening (20 minute read)](https://theamericanscholar.org/baby-shoggoth-is-listening/?utm_source=tldrai)

AI will replace human writers and readers. Influential figures in AI like Tyler Cowen and Gwern argue that writers shouldn't optimize for human readers served by algorithmic feeds but for LLMs that will invariably train on their work. The motivation ranges from practical (LLMs now mediate most information retrieval and composition) to existential (influencing a future superintelligence may be the only lasting legacy).

[### What's up with Anthropic predicting AGI by early 2027? (23 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gabPgK9e83QrmcvbK/what-s-up-with-anthropic-predicting-agi-by-early-2027-1?utm_source=tldrai)

To get Nobel-Prize-winning AIs by early 2027, AIs must fully automate researching engineering by December 2026 and go from completing hour-long tasks today to completing two-week-long tasks in just the next 8 months. OpenAI is only slightly more conservative than Anthropic, estimating automated AI research by March 2028.

[### Notes from reading the Amp manual (5 minute read)](https://hamel.dev/notes/coding-agents/amp.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Amp is a coding agent with support for MCP, the ability to set project, folder, and global context, a permissions system, headless mode, and more. It stores all threads on the server so users can resume a thread anytime. Amp picks the right model for each task, but it can be nudged to use more expensive models. It is pay-per-token and not cheap, but it is worth it because it saves time.
