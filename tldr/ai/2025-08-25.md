[### Build vs Buy in the Age of AI (8 minute read)](https://www.svpg.com/article-build-vs-buy-in-the-age-of-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

There are two ways to solve a problem: build a solution, or buy a solution. Thanks to generative AI, it's now much easier to build. However, that doesn't mean that everyone will build and no one will buy. Business software often contains thousands of complex business rules with millions of lines of business logic that capture constraints and processes around policy, compliance, security, legal, finance, pricing, and more. Many of these rules take considerable time and effort to discern and codify. The vast majority of people, technical or not, who wish to create apps have little to no idea about these business rules.

[### AGI is an engineering problem (6 minute read)](https://www.vincirufus.com/posts/agi-is-engineering-problem/?utm_source=tldrai)

AGI won't emerge purely from making LLMs bigger, but from building agentic systems that orchestrate dozens or thousands of specialized sub-agents. Current LLMs are already as good as the best humans at many tasks across many domains, but lack the architectural infrastructure (context management, memory systems, integrations, and error-tolerant orchestration) needed to effectively elicit those capabilities.

[### Shorter Tokens Are More Likely (7 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iZPKuuWsDXAcQWbLJ/shorter-tokens-are-more-likely?utm_source=tldrai)

Large language models may be pushed to select 'slop' words because those words have more possible endings, even if none of those endings are the best one. Small and seemingly unimportant changes to tokenizers can have an unexpectedly large effect on outputs. Character-level transformers may be worse, but models that try to group tokens so that they're equally 'surprising' might make it better.

[### Meet Agex (2 minute read)](https://ashenfad.github.io/agex/announce/?utm_source=tldrai)

Agex is a Python-native agentic framework that enables agents to work directly with existing libraries and runtimes. It allows agents to receive and return complex Python objects like DataFrames, Plotly figures, or even callables. Agex runs only whitelisted operations within a sandbox. Agents' REPLs are persisted across tasks, so agents can build their own helpers and improve over time.

[### Parallel Thinking with Confidence (3 minute read)](https://jiaweizzhao.github.io/deepconf/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta AI introduced a parallel thinking method that uses model-internal confidence to filter low-quality reasoning traces during or after generation, requiring no extra training or tuning and integrating into existing serving frameworks.

[### How to Fix Your Context (13 minute read)](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/26/how-to-fix-your-context.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Context management is usually the hardest part about building an agent. The job of the agent designer is to make sure agents have the right context window. Context is not free - every token in the context influences model behavior. The massive context windows of modern large language models are a powerful capability, but they can easily result in sloppy information management. Make sure everything in the context is something that matters.

OpenAI has warned investors against unauthorized opportunities to gain exposure to OpenAI, including special purpose vehicles (SPVs). While not every offer of OpenAI equity is problematic, some firms are attempting to circumvent the startup's transfer restrictions. These sales will not be recognized and will carry no economic value to buyers. Anthropic has also told investors to avoid using SPVs to invest in an upcoming round.
