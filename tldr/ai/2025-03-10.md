### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI's ex-policy lead criticizes the company for 'rewriting' its AI safety history (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/openais-ex-policy-lead-criticizes-the-company-for-rewriting-its-ai-safety-history/?utm_source=tldrai)

Former OpenAI researcher Miles Brundage criticized the company for downplaying its cautious approach with GPT-2, which he claims aligns with today's deployment strategy. OpenAI's recent document outlines a continuous approach to AGI development, but Brundage warns this could lead to dismissing valid safety concerns. Competitive pressures could tempt OpenAI to prioritize faster releases over safety, raising questions about long-term risks.

[### The US Army Is Using ‚ÄòCamoGPT' to Purge DEI From Training Materials (5 minute read)](https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-army-is-using-camogpt-to-purge-dei-from-training-materials/?utm_source=tldrai)

The US Army's TRADOC is using an AI tool, CamoGPT, to identify and remove DEIA references from training materials per an executive order by President Trump. CamoGPT, developed by the Army's AI Integration Center, scans documents for specific keywords and has about 4,000 users. The initiative is part of a wider government effort to eliminate DEIA content, leveraging AI for increased efficiency in aligning with national security objectives.

[### Stability AI Secures Investment for AI-Driven Content (3 minute read)](https://stability.ai/news/stability-ai-announces-investment-from-wpp-and-new-partnership-to-shape-the-future-of-media-and-entertainment-production?utm_source=tldrai)

Stability AI has announced a strategic partnership and investment from WPP, aiming to integrate generative AI into advertising and media production.

### Research & Innovation

[### Optimal Hyperparameter Scaling Law in Large Language Model Pretraining (45 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04715?utm_source=tldrai)

Step Law is a unified optimal hyperparameter scaling law that generalizes across diverse model shapes, architectures, and data distributions. This means, using these results, one can predict how models will likely perform before training.

[### Time-Series Forecasting (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02836v1?utm_source=tldrai)

SeqFusion is a framework that sequentially selects and fuses pre-trained models for zero-shot forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches, it minimizes data use to enhance privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy on diverse temporal patterns.

[### Deriving Muon (18 minute read)](https://jeremybernste.in/writing/deriving-muon?utm_source=tldrai)

Adam has been the dominant optimizer for years in deep learning. However, recently the community has found that Muon might be a viable alternative. It accomplishes many of the same things as muP without requiring modifications to the model. This post describes some of the theoretical motivations behind the optimizer.

### Engineering & Resources

[### See how Sourcegraph's new Code Review Agent tackles complex codebases without breaking a sweat (Sponsor)](https://streamyard.com/watch/8qaRAntCryHS?utm_source=tldrai)

Join Sourcegraph's monthly live stream to get a live demo of their brand new [Code Review Agent (EAP)](https://sourcegraph.com/agents) - designed to make reviewing code faster, more precise, and less tedious. The team will also demo agentic chat, auto-edit, and other tools that help enterprises navigate complex codebases with ease. [Join on 3/13 (Thursday) to see it all in action](https://streamyard.com/watch/8qaRAntCryHS)

[### Federated Learning for Neural Feedforward Control (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/j-cap/FL-based-neural-FF-control?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces a federated learning-based approach for neural feedforward control, allowing multi-agent systems to improve tracking performance while preserving data privacy.

[### Autoregressive Streaming Text-to-Speech Model for Any LLM (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/LLMVoX?utm_source=tldrai)

A lightweight 30m parameter model that can be used to augment any language model to enable it to understand and generate speech in response to general purpose queries. Critically, it doesn't require tuning of the underlying model and therefore can transfer across models easily.

[### Distractor Aware SAM (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/jovanavidenovic/DAM4SAM/?utm_source=tldrai)

Segment Anything (SAM) is an industry-leading model for visual analysis and segmentation. However, when there are two similar-looking objects in a video it can get confused. This new work tackles these ‚Äúdistractors‚Äù with additional memory augmentation and training.

### Miscellaneous

[### Gemini Embedding Model (8 minute read)](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-embedding-text-model-now-available-gemini-api/?utm_source=tldrai)

The Gemini team has trained and released an excellent embedding model for text. It tops benchmarks and is reasonably priced while also boasting excellent speed.

[### Token-Efficient Long Video Understanding for Multimodal LLMs (7 minute read)](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/storm/?utm_source=tldrai)

Most video understanding models operate one frame at a time, which makes temporal questions somewhat challenging. STORM, which uses Mamba adapters, adds temporal attention operations. This post compares it against Qwen models.
