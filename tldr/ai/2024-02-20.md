[### Making CLIP‚Äôs Visually Understandable (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10376v1?utm_source=tldrai)

SpLiCE is a new method that makes CLIP's complex visual data easier to understand.

[### KV Quant - Scaling to 10M tokens (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18079?utm_source=tldrai)

Quantizing the KV cache, which is a technical detail of the Transformer architecture, allows it to use less memory at inference time. Quantization is the shrinking of the floating point precision with minimal loss in quality.

[### Enhanced Speech Translation (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10422v1?utm_source=tldrai)

ZeroSwot is a new method for Speech Translation (ST) that overcomes the lack of data and differences between speech and text. It uses unique techniques to train a speech encoder with only speech recognition data, allowing it to work with a multilingual translation model.

[### 3D Diffuser for Smarter Robots (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/nickgkan/3d_diffuser_actor?utm_source=tldrai)

The 3D Diffuser Actor combines diffusion policies and 3D scene representations to improve robot manipulation. This AI-driven approach allows robots to understand and interact with their environment more effectively.

[### Library for ControlVectors (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/vgel/repeng/?utm_source=tldrai)

ControlVectors are a way to cheaply steer semantic generation output. They are cheaper to train than LoRA but can still be quite effective. This library makes it easier.

[### OpenRLHF (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/OpenLLMAI/OpenRLHF?utm_source=tldrai)

This is a Ray-based implementation of RLHF for Llama-style models, which includes Mistral. It contains a number of PPO stabilization tricks to improve performance.
