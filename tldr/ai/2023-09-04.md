### Research & Innovation

[### Head-to-head RLHF vs RLAIF (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00267?utm_source=tldrai)

The first public work on scaling between these two efforts found that they yield essentially identical final model performance with humans preferring them ~70% of the time over baselines.

[### General purpose audio effect removal (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16177?utm_source=tldrai)

Audio deep learning has seen a revival recently. By using a classifier followed by effect-specific modules, a general system can be built to gradually remove effects such as reverb or delay from already mixed audio.

[### Multiview diffusion based 3d generation (29 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16512?utm_source=tldrai)

Another exciting result in the recent string of 3D generation methods. This time the resulting meshes are globally consistent and semantically coherent. There is also room to make this technique much faster.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Gaussian painting (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ReshotAI/gaussian-painters?utm_source=tldrai)

If you optimize Gaussian splatting over multiple independent 2D viewpoints (e.g. unique famous artworks) you get a fabulous stereographic effect.

[### Modular Diffusion (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/cabralpinto/modular-diffusion?utm_source=tldrai)

An easy-to-use modular API to design and train custom Diffusion Models with PyTorch.

[### TextBase (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/cofactoryai/textbase?utm_source=tldrai)

A simple framework for building AI chatbots.

### Miscellaneous

[### Crafting generative AI plugins with WASM (12 minute read)](https://dylibso.com/blog/wasm-ai-plugins/?utm_source=tldrai)

WASM, or web assembly, is a compiler target built into modern browsers. It runs almost as fast as native code and has seen a flurry of interest. This post walks through how to build a plugin system for generative apps using WASM.

[### We Analyzed Millions Of ChatGPT User Sessions (11 minute read)](https://sparktoro.com/blog/we-analyzed-millions-of-chatgpt-user-sessions-visits-are-down-29-since-may-programming-assistance-is-30-of-use/?utm_source=tldrai)

This article discusses data around OpenAI and ChatGPT traffic. OpenAI traffic has declined around 29% since May. Around 29% of ChatGPT prompts are related to programming, while education accounted for around 10% of all use cases. Other use cases include writing assistance, content creation, and creative ideation. Charts showing data on how people use ChatGPT are available.
