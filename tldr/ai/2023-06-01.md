### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI‚Äôs Plans According To Sam Altman (4 minute read)](https://humanloop.com/blog/openai-plans?utm_source=tldrai)

Sam Altman has shared his roadmap for OpenAI, with highlights for the rest of 2023 including a cheaper and faster GPT4, longer context windows, a fine-tuned API, and a stateful API, while 2024 will bring multimodality.

[### World's best open language model is now royalty free (2 minute read)](https://www.tii.ae/news/uaes-falcon-40b-worlds-top-ranked-ai-model-technology-innovation-institute-now-royalty-free?utm_source=tldrai)

The new Falcon models are extremely powerful but were released under a restrictive revenue sharing model. This restriction has now been waived and the models can be used freely. They rank #1 on the HuggingFace leaderboard.

[### Biden Administration Torn On AI Regulation (5 minute read)](https://archive.ph/02uwY?utm_source=tldrai)

Biden administration officials are divided over how aggressively new artificial intelligence tools should be regulated, with some White House and Commerce Department officials favoring strong regulation like those in the EU while those in national security preferring less regulation in order to keep the nation competitive.

### Research & Innovation

[### Improving Mathematical Reasoning With Process Supervision (5 minute read)](https://openai.com/research/improving-mathematical-reasoning-with-process-supervision?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has introduced a new method known as "process supervision" to improve mathematical reasoning capabilities in AI models. This technique focuses on the reasoning process, training the model to solve problems step by step and providing explanations for its solutions. It has shown significant improvements over previous work, extending the capabilities of large language models to handle more complex mathematical problems

[### Poisoning Attacks and Their Impact on Performance of LLMs (6 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00944?utm_source=tldrai)

Some people can trick language models like ChatGPT by adding harmful examples to the training data, causing the models to behave strangely when certain words or phrases are mentioned. This makes the models less useful and raises concerns about their reliability and safety.

[### Likelihood based Diffusion language models (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18619?utm_source=tldrai)

Likelihood is a way of measuring the probability of words being generated. It's one of the keys of modern language models. It hasn't worked yet for diffusion language models until now. It turns out if you add some clever tweaks to the diffusion process (score matching) you can get a 1B parameter model with likelihood based scaling laws that performs as well as 10x smaller language models. We're not there yet, but this is a step in the right direction.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Creating Stylish 3D Avatars (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/icoz69/styleavatar3d?utm_source=tldrai)

The authors present an innovative method to create high-quality, personalized 3D avatars, using a combination of pre-trained image-text diffusion models and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for training. By using these advanced models, we can create diverse, multi-view avatar images in various styles.

[### Langchain Course (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/SamurAIGPT/langchain-course?utm_source=tldrai)

This course is designed to help you get started with LangChain, a powerful open-source framework for developing applications using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.

[### Super Language AIs: From Tool Users to Tool Makers (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ctlllll/llm-toolmaker?utm_source=tldrai)

This recent study introduces a groundbreaking method where big artificial intelligence (AI) language systems, or LLMs, are trained not just to use tools but to create their own to solve problems more efficiently. Rather than depending on existing tools, these LLMs develop their own 'utility functions' - like little software toolkits - which can be used for a variety of tasks and help future problem-solving requests.

### Miscellaneous

[### The Race To Make AI Smaller (5 minute read)](https://archive.ph/CPZi4?utm_source=tldrai)

The BabyLM challenge is a push to develop smaller but still effective AI models due to the drawbacks of large LLM models, for example, the fact that bigger models require processing power that few companies possess.

[### The Largest Turing Test Experiment To Date (7 minute read)](https://www.ai21.com/blog/human-or-not-results?utm_source=tldrai)

AI21 Labs has concluded the largest Turing Test experiment to date, with over 10 million conversations conducted by more than 1.5 million participants. People were able to correctly identify a human 73% of the time, but only 60% of the time when talking to a bot. This suggests that AI chatbots are still not quite indistinguishable from humans, but they are getting closer.
