[### Augment Code: developer AI that thinks in systems, not code snippets (Sponsor)](https://www.augmentcode.com/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter)

Most AI coding copilots spit out generic code with no context of your complex codebase. Instead of the productivity boost you want, you get more spaghetti-untangling work to do.

[Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter) ‚Äî backed by Eric Schmidt and with $270M raised ‚Äî is different:

> Augment is the first developer AI platform that deeply understands entire software systems: components, APIs, and more.

> Augment learns from your entire codebase and related dev ecosystem (docs, dependencies)

> Augment scales to handle even the largest codebases (10M+ line monolith? no problem)

Customers like Webflow, Lemonade, and Kong have said that working with Augment is like pairing with a principal engineer on your team, 24/7.
