[### How AI is changing search, from back-end to front (Sponsor)](https://resources.algolia.com/home/ebook-transforming-search-ai?utm_campaign=tldr_global_wnet_ecomm_reach&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_content=tldr_global_wnet&amp;utm_term=ebo_transforming-search-ai&amp;utm_camp_parent=wnet&amp;utm_2nd_camp=ecomm&amp;utm_region=global&amp;utm_goal=reach&amp;utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&amp;utm_model=cpm&amp;utm_marketing_tactic=reach)

The early days of search were heavily keyword-based. Later, ML and NLP enabled search engines to interpret the semantics behind queries, allowing for more accurate and contextually relevant results.

Today [search is changing again](https://resources.algolia.com/home/ebook-transforming-search-ai?utm_campaign=tldr_global_wnet_ecomm_reach&utm_medium=display&utm_source=tldr&utm_content=tldr_global_wnet&utm_term=ebo_transforming-search-ai&utm_camp_parent=wnet&utm_2nd_camp=ecomm&utm_region=global&utm_goal=reach&utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&utm_model=cpm&utm_marketing_tactic=reach) with the rise of AI and especially genAI ‚Äî and companies that sleep on these changes risk falling behind.

This [white paper by Algolia](https://resources.algolia.com/home/ebook-transforming-search-ai?utm_campaign=tldr_global_wnet_ecomm_reach&utm_medium=display&utm_source=tldr&utm_content=tldr_global_wnet&utm_term=ebo_transforming-search-ai&utm_camp_parent=wnet&utm_2nd_camp=ecomm&utm_region=global&utm_goal=reach&utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&utm_model=cpm&utm_marketing_tactic=reach) explores how AI has transformed both the front-end and back-end landscapes of search technology, including:

* The evolution of search
* The current state of AI-driven solutions
* Challenges and opportunities in this space
* The specific impact of AI on front-end and back-end systems
