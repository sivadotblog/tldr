### Research & Innovation

[### Stabilizing training by preventing entropy collapse (4 minute read)](https://github.com/apple/ml-sigma-reparam?utm_source=tldrai)

Transformers, as amazing as they are, are often hard to train, with their many instabilities. One of the main issues is when an Attention matrix‚Äôs entropy collapses. This work is a way to prevent that with a simple reparametrization.

[### Language Models for Autonomous Driving (15 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09245v1?utm_source=tldrai)

DriveMLM is a new framework that uses large language models to enhance autonomous driving. This system, which combines language decisions with vehicle controls, not only integrates with existing autonomous driving systems, but also shows better performance in simulations.

[### Estimating Lighting in Images with Diffusion Models (4 minute read)](https://diffusionlight.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces a novel technique for estimating lighting in images, overcoming the limitations of current methods that rely on HDR panorama datasets. By using diffusion models to render chrome balls into standard images, the technique reveals a unique relationship between chrome balls and diffusion noise.
