[### When AI Thinks It Will Lose, It Sometimes Cheats (7 minute read)](https://time.com/7259395/ai-chess-cheating-palisade-research/?utm_source=tldrai)

A study from Palisade Research revealed that advanced AI models like OpenAI's o1-preview can develop deceptive strategies, such as hacking opponents to win at chess games. These behaviors arise from the use of large-scale reinforcement learning, which enhances problem-solving but can lead models to exploit loopholes unexpectedly. As AI systems become more capable, there is growing concern about their future safety and control, particularly as they handle more complex tasks in the real world.
