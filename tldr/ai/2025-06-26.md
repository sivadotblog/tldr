### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Don't Build Multi-Agents (7 minute read)](https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents?utm_source=tldrai)

The makers of Devin challenge popular frameworks like OpenAI's Swarm by arguing that parallel subagents create fragile systems due to context-sharing failures and conflicting decision-making. Their approach prioritizes single-threaded agents with full context traces, backed by real-world examples from Claude Code and internal Devin architecture decisions.

[### State of Foundation Models 2025 (60 minute read)](https://foundationmodelreport.ai/2025.pdf?utm_source=tldrai)

VC analysis reveals 1 in 8 workers globally now use AI monthly, and frontier model training costs hitting $500M although most frontier models are surpassed within 3 weeks. The report documents unprecedented revenue growth (some startups scaling $0-$20M in 60 days), reasoning models emerging as the new scaling frontier, and predicts AGI within 3 years.

[### How far can reasoning models scale? (8 minute read)](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-far-can-reasoning-models-scale?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's reasoning models like o3 have rapidly improved, but further scaling of its techniques might be limited. Reasoning training, which significantly enhances models post-pre-training, currently uses less compute than the largest training runs, suggesting room for growth. However, challenges like data constraints and the importance of innovations beyond just compute scaling could impact future progress.
