[### Learn how to fine-tune Meta's new Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) (Sponsor)](https://encord.com/webinar/sam2-webinar/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=tldr-ai&amp;utm_campaign=20240808)

Last week, Meta AI launched SAM 2 - a [new, open foundation model](https://encord.com/webinar/sam2-webinar/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_campaign=20240808) that enables the precise segmentation of any object in any video or image.

Just 24 hours later, Encord became the first platform to integrate SAM 2 for [automated data labeling](https://encord.com/webinar/sam2-webinar/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_campaign=20240808), with initial benchmarks showing [6x performance increases](https://encord.com/webinar/sam2-webinar/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_campaign=20240808).

But does SAM 2 work on YOUR data?

Join the upcoming [Encord webinar](https://encord.com/webinar/sam2-webinar/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_campaign=20240808) to learn more about SAM 2's exciting new capabilities, how you can use it for automated data labeling, and even how to [fine-tune SAM 2](https://encord.com/webinar/sam2-webinar/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_campaign=20240808) on your domain-specific data.
