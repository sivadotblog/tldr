[### Building an AI code reviewer grounded in production telemetry (Sponsor)](https://blog.sentry.io/building-a-code-review-system-that-uses-prod-data-to-predict-bugs/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=paid-community&amp;utm_campaign=seer-fy26q4-aicodereviewlaunch&amp;utm_content=newsletter-prod-blog-learnmore)

If AI code reviewers are supposed to save time, why am I triaging 40 comments about trailing whitespace, "consider using an f-string," and "line exceeds 100 characters" on a 10-line change?

In this [technical deep dive](https://blog.sentry.io/building-a-code-review-system-that-uses-prod-data-to-predict-bugs/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=seer-fy26q4-aicodereviewlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-prod-blog-learnmore), Sentry breaks down how it built an AI code reviewer that uses production telemetry to predict actual errors — not just static style feedback. If you want to understand the [architecture, pipeline, and filtering logic](https://blog.sentry.io/building-a-code-review-system-that-uses-prod-data-to-predict-bugs/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=seer-fy26q4-aicodereviewlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-prod-blog-learnmore) Sentry built, this is for you.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Eight Software Markets AI That Will Transform Differently (20 minute read)](https://davegriffith.substack.com/p/eight-software-markets-ai-that-will?utm_source=tldrai)

Increased efficiency in resource use can lead to higher total consumption, but only when demand is elastic. Cheaper production just changes who captures the surplus when demand is constrained by something other than production cost. AI coding will change how things are built without changing how much gets built or at what quality for a huge amount of economically significant software. This post looks at eight markets to see what impact AI coding will have.

[### Context Personalization (34 minute read)](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/agents_sdk/context_personalization?utm_source=tldrai)

This post demonstrates how to implement long-term memory and stateful personalization in AI agents using OpenAI's Agents SDK. Structured memory objects and context-injection patterns enable agents to recall preferences, consolidate user notes, and evolve over time.

[### Lord of War, meet Lord of Tokens: Torture-testing image models on design-agency grade work (13 minute read)](https://singhkays.com/blog/lord-war-test-image-models/?utm_source=tldrai)

The poster for 'Lord of War', which depicts an image of Nicholas Cage comprised of bullets, is a masterclass in compositing. A team of designers likely had to manually source images of bullets, match the lighting of the individual bullets with the shadows on the face, and arrange thousands of shell casings to form a recognizable human face. That level of skill was rare in 2005. This article explores whether AI can redesign a similar 'Lord of Tokens' image with GPU dies and silicon wafers constituting Jensen Huang's face.

Why is AI stuck in pilot mode? It's constrained by data infrastructure and enterprise context. [CData surveyed 200+ data & AI experts](https://www.cdata.com/lp/ai-data-connectivity-report-2026?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_medium=newsletter_0109&utm_campaign=24Q4_State-of-AI-Connectivity) on what's working (and breaking) in AI data connectivity. The key finding? If your data isn't live, contextual, and governed, your AI won't deliver.[Read the 2026 State of AI Data Connectivity Report.](https://www.cdata.com/lp/ai-data-connectivity-report-2026?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_medium=newsletter_0109&utm_campaign=24Q4_State-of-AI-Connectivity)

[### The Complete Guide to Building Agents with the Claude Agent SDK (22 minute read)](https://nader.substack.com/p/the-complete-guide-to-building-agents?utm_source=tldrai)

This guide walks readers through the process of building a code review agent from scratch that can read files, run commands, edit code, and figure out the steps to accomplish a task. The resulting agent can analyze a code base, find bugs and security issues, and return structured feedback. The guide aims to help readers understand how the Claude Code SDK works so they can build whatever they actually need.

[### Warp Specialization in Triton: Design and Roadmap (20 minute read)](https://pytorch.org/blog/warp-specialization-in-triton-design-and-roadmap/?utm_source=tldrai)

Warp specialization is a popular technique that improves kernel performance on GPUs out of the box. The key idea is to have specialized code paths for each warp instead of the same code. This reduces performance hits due to control flow divergence, improves latency hiding, and makes better use of hardware units on the GPU. This post outlines the current design of warp specialization in Triton, a compiler that aims to generate performance-portable code and runtime across hardware for AI kernels.

[### Scale AI's Agentic Rubrics for Software Agent Verification (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04171?utm_source=tldrai)

Agentic Rubrics enable test-free verification of code changes by creating checklist-style evaluations from expert agents that interact with codebases. They outperform baseline methods on SWE-Bench Verified and offer a scalable, interpretable signal for reinforcement learning and inference-time feedback.

[### AI isn't “just predicting the next word” anymore (23 minute read)](https://stevenadler.substack.com/p/ai-isnt-just-predicting-the-next?utm_source=tldrai)

Modern AI systems have evolved past simply predicting the next word and now demonstrate enhanced capabilities, such as solving complex problems and reasoning. Systems like OpenAI and Google DeepMind have achieved impressive feats, including outperforming top mathematicians in competitions, reflecting significant advancements in cognitive tasks beyond autocomplete.

[### Among the Agents (15 minute read)](https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/among-the-agents?utm_source=tldrai)

Coding agents like Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Opus 4.5 have automated tasks ranging from invoice creation to predicting US corn yields. These agents exhibit capabilities close to artificial general intelligence but require human understanding and oversight to avoid errors and maximize their potential. The rise of these tools signals a shift towards enabling individuals to independently explore complex software projects. They demonstrate the importance of foundational technical knowledge and creating opportunities and challenges for both new and incumbent firms.
