### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI Agreed to Buy $51 Million of AI Chips From a Startup Backed by CEO Sam Altman (7 minute read)](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-buy-ai-chips-startup-sam-altman/?utm_source=tldrai)

During his tenure, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman planned to purchase $51 million worth of AI chips from Rain AI, a company in which he personally invested. Despite his firing and reinstatement, OpenAI expressed possible future collaboration with Rain. This aspect highlights Altman‚Äôs intertwining roles as a vested investor and CEO, which contributed to his firing.

[### Nous research releases Hermes 2.5 vision model (4 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Vision-Alpha?utm_source=tldrai)

Built on top of the best 7B language model with SigLIP integration, this vision model is a powerful new open source text and vision model that can run on consumer hardware. One of the cool innovations here is the integration of function calling. The model is still in alpha because of a hallucination issue.

[### Perplexity AI unveils ‚Äòonline‚Äô LLMs that could dethrone Google Search (6 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/perplexity-ai-unveils-online-llms-that-could-dethrone-google-search/?utm_source=tldrai)

Perplexity AI's combination of a web index and up-to-date information with a conversational AI chatbot-style interface has the potential to dethrone Google. The company recently released fine-tuned and augmented versions of open source models from Mistral and Meta. The models aim to offer helpful, factual, and up-to-date information. They are the first-ever live LLM APIs that are grounded with web search data and have no knowledge cutoff.

### Research & Innovation

[### Linear-Time sequence modeling (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752?utm_source=tldrai)

Another state spaces paper with improved scaling and performance. In this case, they borrow ideas from the LSTM and train a 3B parameter model that outperforms larger 7B parameter Transformer models.

[### LLMs as Functions (8 minute read)](https://blog.vjeux.com/2023/analysis/llm-as-a-function.html?utm_source=tldrai)

When slotting in language models to your code base, a useful mental model is treating them like functions with standard input and output. This blog, from the creator of React Native, shows a few ways you can do that and the benefits of modeling your models this way.

[### Video Motion Editing with a Novel Diffusion Model (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18830?utm_source=tldrai)

MotionEditor is a diffusion model designed for video motion editing, skillfully balancing motion manipulation and original content preservation. It introduces a content-aware motion adapter and a unique two-branch architecture with attention injection, allowing seamless integration of edited motions while maintaining the original background and protagonist's appearance.
