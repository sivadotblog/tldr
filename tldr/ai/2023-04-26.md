Based on the 30B OpenAssistant Llama models, HuggingFace has a fun chat application similar to ChatGPT. It is slower than competitors, but being based on a mostly open model it still has quite some power.

[### Spotify CEO Says AI Is ‚ÄúCool And Scary‚Äù (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/spotify-ceo-says-ai-progress-is-both-really-cool-and-scary-may-pose-risk-to-creative-industry/?utm_source=tldrai)

Spotify's CEO comments on the progress of AI as both "really cool" and "scary," suggesting that the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence could pose a risk to the creative industry, as AI-generated content may challenge traditional artists and creators in terms of originality and competition.

[### Congress gets 40 ChatGPT Plus licenses to start experimenting with generative AI (4 minute read)](https://fedscoop.com/congress-gets-40-chatgpt-plus-licenses/?utm_source=tldrai)

Congressional offices have started using OpenAI's ChatGPT to experiment with AI technology internally. The House of Representatives' digital service recently acquired 40 licenses for ChatGPT Plus, distributing them among Congressional offices. The chatbot is expected to be used for various day-to-day tasks, such as generating constituent response drafts, summarizing speeches, drafting policy papers or bills, and creating logos or graphical elements. This development comes amidst ongoing debates over AI technology usage and regulation in both the private sector and government.

### Research & Innovation

[### Fully Sparse Fusion for 3D Object Detection (6 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12310?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper investigates the integration of image modality into fully sparse architecture for efficient long-range 3D detection, using instance queries to fuse 2D instance segmentation with LiDAR-based 3D segmentation. The resulting framework achieves state-of-the-art results on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, while being 2.7 times faster than other multimodal 3D detection methods.

[### 360¬∞ Rendering: HOSNeRF Unlocks Dynamic Human-Object-Scene Interactions from Single Monocular Videos (8 minute read)](https://showlab.github.io/HOSNeRF/?utm_source=tldrai)

HOSNeRF is a 360¬∞ free-viewpoint rendering method that reconstructs neural radiance fields for dynamic human-object-scene interactions from a single monocular video, addressing challenges like complex object motions and varying interactions. The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on two datasets, with a 40%-50% improvement in LPIPS, and provides compelling 360¬∞ renderings from single videos.

[### Self supervised learning cookbook (55 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12210?utm_source=tldrai)

It could be argued that a lot of the recent success with deep learning has come on the back of self-supervised tasks. There's not a clear boundary between unsupervised and self-supervised, but where it does exist this paper is a really nice exploration of the methods and all of the various hyperparameters that need to be taken into consideration. Self supervised learning is a really powerful technique and this is a cool way to learn more

### Engineering & Resources

[### Track anything (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/gaomingqi/Track-Anything?utm_source=tldrai)

Based on segment anything and XMem, track anything is a flexible and scalable way to track objects and videos. You can then use the masks for automatic video editing, style transfer, or video recognition tasks.

[### Segment Anything in 3D (3 minute read)](https://jumpat.github.io/SA3D/?utm_source=tldrai)

SA3D is a novel framework for one-shot 3D segmentation using neural radiance fields, enabling users to segment target objects in rendered views with minimal manual prompting. The iterative process uses 2D masks, density-guided inverse rendering, and cross-view self-prompts for accurate 3D mask learning, completing segmentation in about 2 minutes without optimization.

[### HealthGPT (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/HealthGPT?utm_source=tldrai)

HealthGPT is an experimental iOS app that allows users to interact with their health data stored in the Apple Health app using natural language.
