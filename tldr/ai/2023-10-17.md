### Headlines & Launches

[### Improved ROCm support (2 minute read)](https://community.amd.com/t5/ai/amd-extends-support-for-pytorch-machine-learning-development-on/ba-p/637756?utm_source=tldrai)

AMD has improved support for its RDNA GPUs (including the RX 7900) and Pytorch for more training options for AI projects.

[### Startup Aims to Build Hundreds of Chip Factories with Prefab Parts and AI (6 minute read)](https://www.fastcompany.com/90962875/nanotronics-cubefabs-prefab-chip-factories?utm_source=tldrai)

Nanotronics is a New York-based industrial AI company that wants to build an AI-enabled chip factory that can be assembled and expanded modularly with prefab pieces. Its Cubefabs system uses AI to take away the need for the specialization normally needed in a lab and allow people who are not semiconductor experts to work at the facilities. Each facility will need only about 30 people to operate. The bulk of each facility can be flat-packed and put in a shipping container.

[### TabLiB 800B tabular token dataset (2 minute read)](https://www.approximatelabs.com/blog/tablib?utm_source=tlrdai)

Dataset of tabular tokens to encourage the community to build Large Data Models that better understand tabular data. It is the largest publicly available tabular dataset - a compilation of 627 million tables together with 867 billion tokens of contextual information. TabLiB is available on Hugging Face.

### Research & Innovation

[### Advanced Head Pose Estimation (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07654v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Figuring out the direction someone's head is turned is important for lots of tech applications. These researchers have developed a new way to estimate head positions from any angle.

[### Boosting LiDAR-Camera Detection (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07084v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The authors of this paper have created a new technique called SupFusion to make LiDAR and camera systems work together better for detecting things like cars or pedestrians.

[### Multimodal Learning without Paired Data (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/MCR-PEFT/Ex-MCR?utm_source=tldrai)

The research introduces Ex-MCR, a novel method that efficiently learns unified contrastive representations for multiple modalities without needing paired data. By aligning existing Multi-modal Contrastive Representations, Ex-MCR achieves top performance in tasks like audio-visual retrieval and 3D object classification.

### Engineering & Resources

[### MosaicFusion: A Tool to Make New Images without Training (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/jiahao000/mosaicfusion?utm_source=tldrai)

MosaicFusion is like a magic tool that can create new pictures with lots of objects without needing any prior learning. It does this in two steps: first, it makes the picture, and then it creates a mask to show where each object is.

[### Enhanced Earth Observation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/qaz670756/mmcd?utm_source=tldrai)

This study introduces a new method that combines digital surface model (DSM) data and aerial images from different times to improve change detection beyond just 2D perspectives.

[### Libgen to txt (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/libgen_to_txt?utm_source=tldrai)

Libgen is likely a dataset in many closed models. While the legality of this dataset for commercial use is under debate, researchers are still using it to better understand data quality for language model training.
