### Headlines & Launches

[### FIFA Debuts AI-Powered Soccer Game (3 minute read)](https://decrypt.co/125313/fifa-launches-ai-powered-world-cup-soccer-game-nft-plans-ahead?utm_source=tldrai)

FIFA today launched the open beta version of World Cup AI League, a 4v4 soccer strategy game that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) for its characters, cosmetics, and gameplay elements.

[### Clearview AI Gave 30 Billion Facebook Images To The Police (4 minute read)](https://archive.ph/s5QX4?utm_source=tldrai)

Clearview AI built it‚Äôs facial recognition database using 30 billion images from Facebook. Because this database has been used by the police nearly a million times now, Clearview is now being accused of putting people in a perpetual police line-up.

[### AI doesn‚Äôt hallucinate, it makes things up (2 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-03/chatgpt-bing-and-bard-don-t-hallucinate-they-fabricate?utm_source=tldrai)

A quick read about the ‚Äúhallucination problem‚Äù in LLMs where they produce outputs that aren‚Äôt factual or are potentially ungrounded. The community has used the word hallucination which is a weird anthropomorphism but does communicate the idea. The argument against that word is simply that, they don‚Äôt hallucinate, they fabricate. These models make stuff up all the time, and sometimes the stuff they make up is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù according to a hard to measure definition of wrong.

### Research & Innovation

[### Language models can critique themselves? (9 minute read)](https://evjang.com/2023/03/26/self-reflection.html?utm_source=tldrai)

In the spirit of solutions being easier to evaluate than generate, language models at scale possess the amazing ability to properly critique their output according to some questions proposed. Doing this recursively and by generating their own questions, language models can increase the quality of their generations dramatically.

[### Language models are the puppet masters (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580?utm_source=tldrai)

People are exploring how language models can use tools - Hugging Face has thousands of AI models hosted on their website, what if each of those was a potential tool? It turns out, you can use ChatGPT as the controller and each Hugging Face model as a specialized tool. Do you want to do a visual question answering task followed by summarization? This work is a first step towards potentially automating that task.

[### VideoMAE V2: Scaling Video Masked Autoencoders with Dual Masking (15 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16727?utm_source=tldrai)

VideoMAE pioneers a scalable and versatile self-supervised pre-training approach for constructing video foundation models using a dual masking strategy and progressive training paradigm. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, VideoMAE proves its efficacy as a general video representation learner for a wide range of downstream tasks.

[### Auto-GPT (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT?utm_source=tldrai)

Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. This program, driven by GPT-4, autonomously develops and manages businesses to increase net worth. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.

[### Marvin (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin?utm_source=tldrai)

Marvin is a library for building AI-powered software.

[### InceptionNeXt: When Inception Meets ConvNeXt (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/sail-sg/inceptionnext?utm_source=tldrai)

InceptionNeXt introduces a novel approach to enhance large-kernel-based CNN models' efficiency while maintaining performance by decomposing large-kernel depthwise convolutions into four parallel branches along the channel dimension. This innovative method results in higher training throughputs and improved top-1 accuracy, offering a more sustainable baseline for future architecture designs.
