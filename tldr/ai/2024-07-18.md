OpenAI and Thrive Global are funding Thrive AI Health to develop a personalized AI health coach catering to daily behaviors essential to health, like sleep and diet. The mobile app and enterprise product will be powered by AI's hyper-personalization capabilities, integrating peer-reviewed science and individual data. The initiative aims to democratize healthy behavior change, address chronic disease management, and demonstrate efficient AI integration into healthcare with strong privacy measures.

[### GraphRAG Analysis, Part 1: How Indexing Elevates Knowledge Graph Performance in RAG (6 minute read)](https://aiencoder.substack.com/p/graphrag-analysis-part-1-how-indexing?utm_source=tldrai)

Analysis of Microsoft's GraphRAG paper reveals that knowledge graphs like Neo4j may not significantly outperform FAISS in context retrieval for RAG applications. While Neo4j without its indexing can achieve a higher answer relevancy, the marginal gains may not justify the investment given ROI constraints. However, the use of Neo4j's indexing shows a noticeable improvement in answer faithfulness, which reduces the risk of fabricated information.
