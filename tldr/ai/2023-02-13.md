### Headlines & Launches

[### Languages are Rewards: Hindsight Finetuning using Human Feedback (15 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02676/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Human feedback is key to improving AI systems. Most mainstream techniques only allow models to learn from positive feedback. This work explores extending that paradigm to also include negative feedback.

[### Magician: the AI Assistant for designers and developers (3 minute read)](https://blog.diagram.com/p/introducing-genius?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Genius released Magician, an AI design companion on Figma that supports you as a designer by following you around the screen, helping create UIs, and making suggestions. Think of it as autocomplete or GitHub Copilot, but for design. GPT-3 meets Figma.

[### Runway launches AI video generator - Stable Diffusion for video (4 minute read)](https://research.runwayml.com/gen1?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Runway has launched Gen-1, an AI system for video generation that works similarly to its text-to-image model Stable Diffusion. With Gen-1, users can transfer styles from images or prompts to videos, turn mockups into animated renders, isolate and modify subjects in videos, turn untextured renders into realistic outputs, and customize the model for better results.

[### Google uses AI to make Maps more immersive (4 minute read)](https://blog.google/products/maps/sustainable-immersive-maps-announcements//?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google Maps adds updates for immersive view and Live View, along with new features for electric vehicle (EV) drivers and people who walk, bike or ride public transit. These updates create an incredibly realistic view that accounts for weather changes, shows where building entrances are, and allows you to explore and navigate both indoors and outdoors with AR.

### Research & Innovation

[### Latent Upscaler for Stable Diffusion (4 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-x2-latent-upscaler/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Latent Upscaler for Stable Diffusion lets you upscale the generations in the latent space to improve image quality by 2x. It‚Äôs plug and play in Hugging Face diffusers pipelines for text-to-image generation.

[### The Flan Collection: Designing Data and Methods for Effective Instruction Tuning (20 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13688?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

FlanT5 from Google is one of the best open source language models available. Its performance comes from a process called ‚Äúinstruction tuning‚Äù where models are tuned to better follow instructions. This paper is a followup exploring the different tasks and instructions used for this (and other) model

[### A Multitask, Multilingual, Multimodal Evaluation of ChatGPT on Reasoning, Hallucination, and Interactivity (60 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04023?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Serious academic eval of ChatGPT. We have all been amazed by the ability of chatGPT, but it‚Äôs not clear where the holes in performance lie. This paper proposes 21 benchmarks to measure performance. They find that ChatGPT does well in general, but there‚Äôs room for improvement!

[### Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools (30 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761v1/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Language models suffer from hallucination since the memory and knowledge is stored in the weights. We can get around that by allowing them to query external tools. This paper explores how to do that in a general manner and lists some interesting tools that might benefit large language models.

### Miscellaneous

[### Announcing MedARC: the launch of the Medical AI Research Center (4 minute read)](https://www.medarc.ai/blog/announcement?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Medical AI Research Center (MedARC) is a novel, open, and collaborative approach to research dedicated to advancing the field of AI applied to healthcare. Partnered with StabilityAI, they believe medical AI should have a foundational model similar to GPT-3 for text and Stable Diffusion for images. Thus, MedARC wants to create an open-source and decentralized research community to share datasets and collaborate on AI-driven research in medicine.

[### Google Research, 2022 & beyond: Algorithmic advances (10 minute read)](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/02/google-research-2022-beyond-algorithmic.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google prioritizes the development of robust algorithms, especially for its ML and AI models, which are crucial for its services like Search, Ads, Maps, and YouTube. Google Research is at the forefront of this effort, making advancements in areas such as scalability, privacy, market algorithms, and algorithmic foundations. In 2022, Google continued to progress in these areas and advanced the state-of-the-art. This article highlights the progress made in these areas.

[### Dreamix: Video Diffusion Models are General Video Editors (GitHub Repo)](https://dreamix-video-editing.github.io/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google developed a new method for text-based video editing using a video diffusion model. This approach combines low-resolution information from the original video with new, high-resolution information synthesized to match the text prompts. The method also introduces a new, mixed objective to improve motion editability and a new framework for image animation. Experiments have shown that this method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of editing ability.
