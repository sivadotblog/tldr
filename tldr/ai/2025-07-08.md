[### Economics of Claude 3 Opus Inference (38 minute read)](https://x.com/tessera_antra/status/1941563920587817203?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic recently announced the deprecation of API access to Claude 3 Opus. The decision to deprecate the API addresses a real operational issue. This article looks at the economics of reduced-scale inference and looks at alternative solutions that can be a win-win for both Anthropic and independent researchers. Keeping inference access to Claude 3 Opus is more complex than it seems at a glance.

[### A Review of Alpha School, the private school with 2-hour days and AI teachers (74 minute read)](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-review-alpha-school?utm_source=tldrai)

A parent's year-long investigation revealed the $40,000 Austin school actually takes 3.5 hours daily with a 5:1 teacher ratio and extensive incentive systems, not AI-powered teacher-free education as marketed. While students do advance 2.6x faster through material using personalized learning platforms, parents argue the real value isn't speed, but freeing up time - it potentially gives kids ~9 additional years outside of the classroom to pursue their own interests.

[### Your AI-powered application might already be broken (Sponsor)](https://sentry.io/solutions/sentry-for-ai/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=paid-community&amp;utm_campaign=ai-fy26q2-aisolutions&amp;utm_content=newsletter-learnmore-learnmore#tracing-performance)

Agents, LLMs, vector stores, custom logic. There's a lot that can go wrong, and you'll miss most of it if your observability stops at the model call. With [Sentry's new AI and LLM monitoring](https://sentry.io/solutions/sentry-for-ai/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=ai-fy26q2-aisolutions&utm_content=newsletter-learnmore-learnmore#tracing-performance), you'll know exactly what AI was trying to do when your application broke, before your users find it.

[### CoRT (Chain of Recursive Thoughts) (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/PhialsBasement/Chain-of-Recursive-Thoughts?utm_source=tldrai)

CoRT enhances AI models by making them self-evaluate and repeatedly generate alternatives for optimal responses. Testing with Mistral 3.1 24B showed significant performance improvements in programming tasks. The process involves iterative response generation and selection, leading to more refined AI outputs.

[### BitNet (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet?utm_source=tldrai)

An inference framework for Microsoft's BitNet b1.58, a 1.58-bit (ternary) large language model designed for efficient and lossless CPU inference using optimized low-bit kernels.

[### Microjax (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/joelburget/microjax?utm_source=tldrai)

Microjax is a tiny autograd engine with a Jax-like API. It was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd, a PyTorch-like library with about 150 lines of code. JAX uses a more functional style, which some developers prefer.

[### The ‚ÄòChatGPT Moment' in Robotics and beyond (11 minute read)](https://paritoshmohan.substack.com/p/the-chatgpt-moment-in-robotics-and?utm_source=tldrai)

Three years ago, getting a robot to reliably pick up objects required an army of engineers. Today, a college student can download an open-source vision-language-action model, fine-tune it on a weekend, and achieve results that would have taken industry teams months to accomplish. This article looks at what a 'ChatGPT moment' for robotics would look like, the current state of the industry, upcoming technologies, and likely winners. Being surrounded by robots in everyday settings will feel surreal at first, but we will soon rely on them just like we do with AI assistants for the most basic needs of our lives.

[### Replit Dynamic Intelligence for Replit Agent (2 minute read)](https://blog.replit.com/dynamic-intelligence?utm_source=tldrai)

Replit introduced Dynamic Intelligence for its Agent, adding three capabilities: Extended Thinking, High Power Model, and Web Search. These enhancements improve context awareness, iterative reasoning, and autonomous behavior, allowing the Agent to adapt and solve complex tasks efficiently. Users can toggle these features per request, optimizing the Agent's problem-solving capabilities for different scenarios.

[### Huawei denies allegations of copying Alibaba's AI model (6 minute read)](https://www.computerworld.com/article/4018098/chinas-ai-unity-fractures-as-huawei-faces-model-theft-allegations-from-the-alibaba-camp.html?utm_source=tldrai)

An anonymous whistleblower claiming to work at Huawei presented a technical analysis showing that the new Pangu model was trained by ‚Äúupcycling‚Äù Alibaba's Qwen model rather than training from scratch. Using "model fingerprinting", they calculated a 0.9 correlation coefficient between the models. The evidence isn't conclusive - critics have pointed out flaws in the fingerprinting methodology.
