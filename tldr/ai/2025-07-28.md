[### Unleash Anthropic's most powerful models on your entire codebase with Claude Code (Sponsor)](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=email_b2c2b&amp;utm_campaign=acq_code_us_q3&amp;utm_content=newsletter_text_primary_7-22)

Working with coding agents gets frustrating: constant command-tabbing, manually copying files, writing convoluted prompts to explain dependencies‚Ä¶there has to be a better way.

There is. [Claude Code automatically maps and understands your entire project structure](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email_b2c2b&utm_campaign=acq_code_us_q3&utm_content=newsletter_text_primary_7-22) without manual context selection. And by knowing your codebase, it aces complex tasks where other agents stutter:

‚úÖ Multi-file edits that actually compile.

‚úÖ GitHub issues become PRs while you grab coffee.

‚úÖ Deep codebase refactors that would take hours, done in minutes.

Best part? [Claude Code runs directly in your terminal](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email_b2c2b&utm_campaign=acq_code_us_q3&utm_content=newsletter_text_primary_7-22). Multiply your productivity without changing your workflow.

[### Why China isn't about to leap ahead of the West on compute (13 minute read)](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/why-china-isnt-about-to-leap-ahead-of-the-west-on-compute?utm_source=tldrai)

Chinese hardware has closed the computational performance gap from 10x to just 3x behind NVIDIA's latest chips, yet over 90% of notable Chinese language models since 2017 were still trained on Western hardware. Major bottlenecks in chip manufacturing yields‚ÄîSMIC achieves below 50% compared to TSMC's 90%‚Äîand immature software ecosystems mean Chinese developers continue preferring NVIDIA when available.
