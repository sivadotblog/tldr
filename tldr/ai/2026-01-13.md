[### Sentry's AI Debugger Uses Your Actual Error Data – Not Just Code (Sponsor)](https://sentry.io/product/seer/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=paid-community&amp;utm_campaign=seer-fy26q4-seerlaunch&amp;utm_content=newsletter-product-lp-learnmore)

Most AI coding tools only see your source code. Seer, [Sentry's AI debugging agent](https://sentry.io/product/seer/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=seer-fy26q4-seerlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-product-lp-learnmore), sees everything Sentry knows: stack traces, logs, breadcrumbs, spans, commit history, and the full error context. That's why it can [pinpoint root causes with 95% accuracy](https://sentry.io/product/seer/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=seer-fy26q4-seerlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-product-lp-learnmore) – even in parts of your codebase you've never touched.

How it works:

* Sentry logs an issue.
* Seer analyzes it using all available context.
* Seer suggests a fix, opens a PR automatically, or writes unit tests to prevent regressions.

Seer also scans issues and assigns actionability scores, so teams know which bugs are most likely to be fixable with a code change.

[### Digital Red Queen: Adversarial Program Evolution in Core War with LLMs (13 minute read)](https://sakana.ai/drq/?utm_source=tldrai)

Core War is a competitive programming game in which battle programs fight for dominance inside a virtual computer. This study explores what happens when large language models drive an adversarial evolutionary arms race where programs continuously adapt to defeat a growing history of opponents rather than a static benchmark. The dynamic adversarial process led to the emergence of increasingly general strategies. The Core War sandbox offers a safe and controlled environment for analyzing how AI agents might evolve in real-world adversarial settings such as cybersecurity.

[### The AI data center deals that no one can verify (10 minute read)](https://davefriedman.substack.com/p/the-ai-data-center-deals-that-no?utm_source=tldrai)

The AI industry has announced more than half a trillion dollars of infrastructure commitments over the past year. The headline figures are being priced as if they represent binding, time-certain capex commitments, but the disclosed language and missing definitions make many of them look more like optionality dressed up as commitment. The refusal to standardize terms, define units, and allow any market-based verification suggests the participants prefer a world where scrutiny is expensive. The market is being asked to trust without the tools to verify.

[### When AI writes almost all code, what happens to software engineering? (12 minute read)](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/when-ai-writes-almost-all-code-what?utm_source=tldrai)

AI models like Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 now write most software code, prompting a shift in software engineering practices. This reduces the value of language expertise and routine coding tasks while increasing the demand for tech leads who are product-minded. Although AI can handle more of the coding workload, engineers will need to oversee complex tasks, emphasizing a hybrid skill set in both product management and technical expertise.

Building effective AI agents requires strong context, memory, and workflow-aligned architecture. They multiply human output by handling routine tasks while humans focus on judgment, and should resolve issues directly rather than just reporting them. Fast deployment and continuous iteration create compounding value, making custom agents far more effective than generic AI SaaS.
