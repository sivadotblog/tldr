[### Framework + Scorecard: AI prototyping for product leaders (Sponsor)](https://miro.com/resources/ai-prototyping-landscape-guide/?utm_campaign=glb-26q4-nsp-wp-c3_o2-prototypes_product_guide&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=paidmedia&amp;utm_content=sponsorship&amp;src=-tldr_glb)

According to Forrester, 88% of engineering, product, and design leaders think prototyping needs to happen earlier. Wait til late in the lifecycle to surface changes and you'll get months of delays.

🤔 But to find issues when you still have time to fix them, you need tools that create editable prototypes, not fully fleshed bad ideas.

In this [Miro guide](https://miro.com/resources/ai-prototyping-landscape-guide/?utm_campaign=glb-26q4-nsp-wp-c3_o2-prototypes_product_guide&utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paidmedia&utm_content=sponsorship&src=-tldr_glb), product leaders get a:

Rnj-1 is a world-class pair of base and instruction-tuned large language models. The 8B model roughly follows the open-source Gemma 3 architecture. The Rnj-1 Base and Instruct models compare favorably against similarly sized open weight models. This post summarizes the key capabilities of the models and covers the background behind their development.

[### Titans + MIRAS: Helping AI have long-term memory (12 minute read)](https://research.google/blog/titans-miras-helping-ai-have-long-term-memory/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google Research has released two new papers introducing an architecture (Titans) and a theoretical blueprint (MIRAS) that combine the speed of recurrent neural networks with the accuracy of transformers. Together, Titans and MIRAS advance the concept of test-time memorization, the ability of an AI model to maintain long-term memory. They introduce a meaningful shift toward real-time adaptation. The architecture actively learns and updates its own parameters as data streams in, enabling the model to incorporate new, specific details into its core knowledge instantly.

[### Computer-science Reinforcement Learning Got Rewards Wrong (6 minute read)](https://gist.github.com/yoavg/3eb3e722d38e887a0a8ac151c62d9617?utm_source=tldrai)

In reinforcement learning, the reward is part of the agent, not part of the environment. Once we start thinking in terms of the reward translation as being part of the agent, we can also start thinking of ways in which the agent can affect the reward translation mechanism. It could be dynamic and change across time, be tied to policy, or even learned. The shift in perspective creates many possible options, just by changing the notation - because notation matters.
