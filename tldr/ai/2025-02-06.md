[### SoftBank-backed billionaire to invest $230M in Indian AI startup Krutrim (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/softbank-backed-billionaire-to-invest-230m-in-indian-ai-startup-krutrim/?utm_source=tldrai)

Bhavish Aggarwal is investing $230 million in his AI startup Krutrim to develop LLMs for Indian languages, aiming to raise $1.15 billion in total. Krutrim has open-sourced its AI models and plans to build India's largest supercomputer with Nvidia. The startup has released Krutrim-2, a 12-billion-parameter model, showing strong performance in Indian language tasks and code generation.

[### DeepSeek Gets an 'F' in Safety From Researchers (3 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/deepseek-gets-an-f-in-safety-from-researchers-2000558645?utm_source=tldrai)

Cisco tested DeepSeek's open-source model, DeepSeek R1, which failed to fend off all 50 harmful behavior prompts from the HarmBench dataset. DeepSeek's failure rate is the highest among tested LLMs, with other models like Meta's Llama 3.1 and OpenAI's o1 performing noticeably better. The model's susceptibility to attacks, alongside data security concerns, has raised significant scrutiny and criticism.

[### Sam Altman Says OpenAI Is Going to Deliver a Beatdown on DeepSeek (4 minute read)](https://futurism.com/sam-altman-openai-better-models-deepseek?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's Sam Altman responded to Chinese startup DeepSeek's R1 model outperforming competitors at lower costs, which created significant turbulence in the tech industry, by pledging to continue heavy investment in compute resources, emphasizing ambition towards AGI. The situation raises questions about the viability of OpenAI's costly approach given DeepSeek's efficient alternatives.

[### How Indigenous engineers are using AI to preserve their culture (7 minute read)](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/indigenous-engineers-are-using-ai-preserve-culture-rcna176012?utm_source=tldrai)

Indigenous researchers are using AI and machine learning to build speech recognition models for over 200 endangered Indigenous languages in North America. Initiatives like First Languages AI Reality train Native scientists to ethically handle culturally sensitive data and preserve language. Programs such as Tech Natives and IndigiGenius aim to boost Indigenous representation in tech to preserve cultural heritage through AI.

[### Chinese and Iranian Hackers Are Using U.S. AI Products to Bolster Cyberattacks (5 minute read)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/technology/artificial-intelligence/chinese-and-iranian-hackers-are-using-u-s-ai-products-to-bolster-cyberattacks/ar-AA1y37M3?utm_source=tldrai)

Hackers from China, Iran, and other nations are using AI, specifically Google's Gemini, to enhance cyberattacks, treating it as a tool for boosting productivity rather than creating groundbreaking techniques. Google reports found that groups linked to these countries are leveraging Gemini for research and phishing, with China and Iran being the most active users. Although AI hasn't yet transformed the scale of cyberattacks, both the U.S. and China are heavily investing in AI technologies for future dominance.
