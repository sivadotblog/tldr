### Headlines & Launches

[### Can ChatGPT fill in mentorship gaps for Gen Z workers? (7 minute read)](https://www.worklife.news/technology/chatgpt-gen-z/?utm_source=tldrai)

ChatGPT, launched at the end of 2022, is being considered as a potential tool to address mentorship gaps for Gen Z workers. The AI tool can help new employees in various industries, like journalism, by answering questions about interviews or workplace etiquette that they may not have a mentor to consult. While ChatGPT provides helpful generic advice, experts caution against relying on it too much, as it cannot offer personalized guidance or replace the learning experiences gained from making mistakes.

[### Introducing Microsoft Security Copilot (3 minute read)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft Security Copilot is an AI-powered security analysis tool that enables analysts to respond to threats quickly, process signals at machine speed, and assess risk exposure in minutes. Microsoft Security Copilot is currently in preview and still waiting for public release.

### Research & Innovation

[### GPTEVAL: NLG Evaluation using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignment (7 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634?utm_source=tldrai)

GPTEVAL introduces a groundbreaking framework that leverages large language models with chain-of-thoughts and form-filling paradigms to assess the quality of natural language generation outputs. Demonstrating a remarkable improvement in correlation with human judgments, this novel approach also uncovers potential biases in LLM-based evaluators.

[### Less deep learning and more long learning (7 minute read)](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-03-27-long-learning?utm_source=tldrai)

A nice summary of the recent line of work from Stanford trying to dramatically increase the context window for language models. If we could take in longer prompts or output longer generations, this may open up a world of tasks such as full book summarization, repository level code edits, and multi modal video generation

[### ‚àû-Diff: Infinite Resolution Diffusion (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18242?utm_source=tldrai)

‚àû-Diff is introduced as a novel generative diffusion model that operates on infinite resolution data, learning a continuous function for sampling at any resolution. This approach surpasses other infinite resolution models by working directly on raw data, yielding higher sample quality and scaling effectively to resolutions beyond the training data.

[### Nano bind C++ to python (4 minute read)](https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/why.html?utm_source=tldrai)

From the author of the immensely popular pybind11 framework for connecting low level code to python we have another (hopefully simpler) framework. They found that since their code is a massive dependency for many popular libraries such as Pytorch it has grown in complexity. Nano bind won't support every feature in every version of C++ which allows it to be far simpler and lightweight.

[### Image Generation with Multiview 2D Diffusion Models (GitHub Repo)](https://jeffreyxiang.github.io/ivid/?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper presents a groundbreaking 3D-aware image generation technique that employs 2D diffusion models in a multiview 2D image set generation framework. By incorporating depth information and training on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, the method achieves superior image quality and generates images with large view angles from diverse real-world environments.
