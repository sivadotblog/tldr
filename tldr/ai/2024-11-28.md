The holidays are here, and so are the cyber risks‚Äîyour personal data is on sale, and the buyer could be anyone. A legal loophole allows data brokers to collect your personal information and sell it to the highest bidder.

This holiday season, give yourself the gift of security and peace of mind. You can either:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Contact dozens of data brokers individually to get your data removed;

2Ô∏è‚É£ Or sign up for Incogni, and let them handle it all for you.

Incogni contacts dozens of data brokers on your behalf ‚Äî getting your data off the web, and making sure it stays off.

‚úÖ Over 20,000,000 data removals completed to date

### Headlines & Launches

[### Qwen's first reasoning inspired model QwQ (22 minute read)](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwq-32b-preview/?utm_source=tldrai)

Qwen has released a 32B parameter reasoning model that performs similarly to OpenAI's o1 series of models. The company observed scaling performance when sampling longer reasoning traces. The model is available to use and excels at mathematics and coding.

[### OpenAI trademarking o1 reasoning models (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/openai-moves-to-trademark-its-reasoning-models/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has filed a trademark application for its latest AI model, o1, as the firm moves to shield its IP.

[### ElevenLabs' new feature is a NotebookLM competitor for creating GenAI podcasts (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/elevenlabs-new-feature-is-a-notebooklm-competitor-for-creating-genai-podcasts/?utm_source=tldrai)

ElevenLabs has introduced GenFM, a feature in its iOS app that creates AI-generated multispeaker podcasts from uploaded content. Supporting 32 languages, the feature adds natural human elements like 'ums' and pauses to enhance authenticity in the podcast experience. ElevenLabs has planned further customization options and an expansion into new markets, including India and Poland.

### Research & Innovation

[### Faster Inference for Long Sequences with Star Attention (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17116v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Star Attention offers a block-sparse approach to speed up Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) during long-sequence inference.

[### Image editing on the video manifold (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16819?utm_source=tldrai)

In early image synthesis, traversing the latent space was a great way to generate diverse images. Now, the same can be done with video to generate sequential edits to a single image while maintaining semantic consistency.

[### Low-Bit Quantization Favors Undertrained LLMs (21 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17691?utm_source=tldrai)

Models trained for less time on fewer tokens experience less degradation when being quantized after training. This suggests, as has been seen in other work, that models use the extra precision to fully compress more and more information during extended training.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Sketch Agent (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/yael-vinker/SketchAgent?utm_source=tldrai)

SketchAgent leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal LLM to facilitate language-driven, sequential sketch generation through an intuitive sketching language. It can sketch diverse concepts, engage in interactive sketching with humans, and edit content via chat.

[### Real-time 3D Reconstruction (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/chenhoy/droid-splat?utm_source=tldrai)

A deep-learning-based dense visual SLAM framework that achieves real-time global optimization of poses and 3D reconstruction.

[### Protein Ensemble Generative Model (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/bleach366/p2dflow?utm_source=tldrai)

P2DFlow is a protein ensemble generative model with SE(3) flow matching based on ESMFold. The ensembles generated by P2DFlow could aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios.

### Miscellaneous

[### OK, I can partly explain the LLM chess weirdness now (20 minute read)](https://dynomight.net/more-chess/?utm_source=tldrai)

Recent experiments suggest that GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct can play chess well compared to other LLMs due to potential differences in base model training and data quality. Various prompting techniques and examples enhanced chess performance of other models like GPT-4o, though not to the same extent. The analysis indicates OpenAI's strategy might involve curating high-quality chess data for better LLM performance.

[### Cradle Bio Series B (6 minute read)](https://www.cradle.bio/blog/series-b?utm_source=tldrai)

Cradle has solved a critical challenge in optimizing protein shapes. It is now expanding its team and efforts to land this technology in the hands of practitioners everywhere.

[### Teach mode, Rabbit's tool for automating R1 tasks, is now available to all users (6 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/ai/teach-mode-rabbits-tool-for-automating-r1-tasks-is-now-available-to-all-users-170036677.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Rabbit R1 has introduced a teach mode feature which allows users to train its AI to automate tasks on any website. Aiming to improve functionality and productivity, the feature supports complex multi-platform interactions. It potentially offers a better experience than using dedicated apps. Rabbit envisions a marketplace for user-created automations. It is hoping for broader adoption despite potential platform challenges.
