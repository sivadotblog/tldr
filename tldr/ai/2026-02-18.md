[### Airia: Enterprise AI orchestration that unifies experimentation, prod, and governance (Sponsor)](https://airia.com?utm_source=TLDR&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=February182026)

You want AI to be more than a never-ending work in progress, and that means enabling no-code, low-code, and pro-code development without IT gatekeepers standing in the way. Yet that doesn't mean governance goes out the window.

[Airia is the enterprise AI platform](https://airia.com?utm_source=TLDR&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_campaign=February182026) built to drive AI adoption by unifying innovation and security. Teams at Stryker, BuzzFeed, and ArcelorMittal use it to:

* Test prompts, LLMs, and agent variants in safe, prod-like environments
* End AI anxiety by controlling agent sprawl and [implementing automatic guardrails](https://airia.com?utm_source=TLDR&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_campaign=February182026)
* Discover risks, orchestrate agents, and monitor threats in one place

[Get a demo](https://airia.com?utm_source=TLDR&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_campaign=February182026) and make AI adoption a reality

[### On Dwarkesh Patel's 2026 Podcast With Elon Musk and Other Recent Elon Musk Things (42 minute read)](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/on-dwarkesh-patels-2026-podcast-with-850?utm_source=tldrai)

Elon Musk recently went on a podcast to discuss alignment, AI data centers in space, robots, China, and more. Musk is very gung-ho about data centers in space, robots, and making his own fabs. He plans to make virtual humans and robots to turn on an 'infinity money glitch'. Otherwise, China will win - they're already more productive.

[### OpenAI's acquisition of OpenClaw signals the beginning of the end of the ChatGPT era (7 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/technology/openais-acquisition-of-openclaw-signals-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's acquisition of OpenClaw marks a strategic shift from conversational AI to autonomous agents capable of executing tasks. OpenClaw's popularity stemmed from its unrestrained, robust functionality, combining tool access, sandboxed code execution, and integration with messaging platforms. This move signals a new phase for enterprise AI as companies race to develop secure, deployable versions of dynamic AI agents.

### Engineering & Research

[### The weakest link in enterprise AI is rarely the models (Sponsor)](https://welodata.ai/ai-data-quality-systems/?utm_source=tldr-ai-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=2026-ad-welo-data-quality-at-scale)

Human judgment is the hardest part to scale. You're relying on people to validate training data, evaluate models, review edge cases, and enforce policies — are they judging consistently and defensibly? [Welo Data](https://welodata.ai/ai-data-quality-systems/?utm_source=tldr-ai-newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2026-ad-welo-data-quality-at-scale) builds systems that support human + AI judgment at scale. [Talk to an expert](https://welodata.ai/ai-data-quality-systems-human-judgment-at-scale/?utm_source=tldr-ai-newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2026-ad-welo-data-quality-at-scale)

[### Experiential Reinforcement Learning (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13949?utm_source=tldrai)

ERL trains policies with an explicit attempt → feedback → reflection → revised attempt loop, then reinforced the successful revision back into the base model. The approach improves sparse-reward learning and tool-using reasoning performance while keeping deployment-time inference cost unchanged.

[### Cohere's Family of Open Models (9 minute read)](https://cohere.com/blog/cohere-labs-tiny-aya?utm_source=tldrai)

Cohere Labs released TinyAya-Base (3.35B) and instruction-tuned TinyAya-Global plus regional variants, aiming for balanced quality across ~67 languages on consumer hardware. The drop also included a multilingual fine-tuning dataset, new benchmarks, and a technical report for reproducible multilingual experimentation.

[### Open-Web Simulator for Agent Training (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14721?utm_source=tldrai)

WebWorld uses a pipeline of 1M+ open-web interactions to simulate long-horizon (30+ step) browsing tasks, paired with a multi-metric WebWorld-Bench for intrinsic evaluation. Trajectories synthesized from the simulator boosted downstream web-agent performance and transferred to other domains like code, GUI, and games.

[### The future of design is code and canvas (2 minute read)](https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-is-code-and-canvas/?utm_source=tldrai)

Figma users can now bring work from Claude Code into the platform. They just need to install the Figma MCP, type 'Send this to Figma', and the browser's rendered state will be automatically translated to fully editable Figma layers. Workflows are changing, and it's easy to get lost in the momentum of creation. The new Claude Code to Figma Design integration aims to help designers escape that tunnel vision, zoom out, and explore the big picture.

### Miscellaneous

[### Cursor launched a plugin marketplace for agent integrations (4 minute read)](https://cursor.com/blog/marketplace?utm_source=tldrai)

Cursor added plugin support so agents could connect to external tools and extend capabilities via packaged MCP servers, skills, subagents, rules, and hooks.
