### Headlines & Launches

[### Elon Musk is moving forward with a new Generative AI project at Twitter (5 minute read)](https://archive.ph/tA46W#selection-1861.0-1877.214?utm_source=tldrai)

Elon Musk seems to be cooking up an AI project at Twitter, despite recently supporting a pause on AI training. He has bought about 10,000 GPUs, usually used for working on big AI models, and has been hiring AI experts while exploring options to compete with ChatGPT. The exact purpose of this generative AI at Twitter is still unclear, but it could potentially be used to enhance search functionality or advertising.

[### Free Dolly, commercially viable instruction tuned model (4 minute read)](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm?utm_source=tldrai)

2 weeks after their release of Dolly 1.0, Databricks releases their next version of their model Dolly 2. This model is an open instruction tuned model based on the EleutherAI Pythia models. It has been instruction tuned on a new commercially viable data set. It's not clear how it compares to the llama based models, or GPT 3.5 turbo, but it's exciting to have work that is more open than before.

### Research & Innovation

[### Resource-efficient CLIP (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06028?utm_source=tldrai)

RECLIP introduces a resource-efficient approach for CLIP pretraining that leverages small images for large-scale language supervision and fine-tunes with high-resolution data. This method achieves competitive zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval accuracy while using 6-8x less computational resources and 7-9x fewer FLOPs than the baseline, making it more accessible to the broader research community.

[### Agents for science (15 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05332?utm_source=tldrai)

The idea of language models acting as planners for tools (which may be other language models) is increasing in popularity in the community. Essentially a central, powerful, language model such as GPT-4 is given access to a set of tools. These tools could be web search, documentation, python engine, and in this case an experimentation API. Powered by these additional capabilities, the model was able to synthesize chemicals, reason about reactions, and even refused to synthesize heroin - which is an interesting example of potentially out of distribution alignment.

[### Multilingual ChatGPT (13 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05613?utm_source=tldrai)

This study evaluates ChatGPT's effectiveness across 7 tasks and 37 languages to better understand its multilingual capabilities. Despite its success in English, ChatGPT's performance is worse than previous models in various NLP tasks and languages, highlighting the need for further research in developing more effective models for multilingual learning.

[### Deepspeed Chat (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeedExamples/tree/master/applications/DeepSpeed-Chat?utm_source=tldrai)

Deepspeed is one of the best open source frameworks for distributed training. They have integrated many of the best methods from research papers. They‚Äôve released a new tool called DeepSpeed Chat - which performs the 3 step process necessary to get a fully RLHF‚Äôd model. These 3 steps are: supervised fine-tuning, reward model training, and the RL step. Because of the power of the underlying tools, DeepSpeed Chat is 15x faster than other frameworks and scales to models that are billions of parameters.

[### Wombat: from RLHF to RRHF, Aligning Human Preferences in a 'Right' Way (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/GanjinZero/RRHF?utm_source=tldrai)

The novel RRHF learning paradigm efficiently aligns language model outputs with human preferences, requiring fewer models and offering a simpler alternative to PPO. Evaluated on LLaMA and Alpaca datasets, RRHF demonstrates performance comparable to PPO while streamlining the alignment process within a single training session.
