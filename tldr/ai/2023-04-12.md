### Headlines & Launches

[### China releases rules for generative AI like ChatGPT after Alibaba, Baidu launch services (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/11/china-releases-rules-for-generative-ai-like-chatgpt-after-alibaba-launch.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Chinese regulators on Tuesday released draft rules designed to manage how companies develop so-called generative artificial intelligence products like ChatGPT. The Cyberspace Administration of China‚Äôs draft measures lay out the ground rules that generative AI services have to follow, including the type of content these products are allowed to generate. For example, the content generated by AI needs to reflect the core values of socialism and should not subvert state power, according to the draft rules.

### Research & Innovation

[### Revisiting the classic: Scaling RNNs over sequence length (27 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04057?utm_source=tldrai)

Context length is a hot topic in AI. We're trying to scale text models to longer and longer sequences. This work scales an RNN to a million context tokens. It's not directly applicable, but there are some lovely nuggets here.

[### Video-kMaX: A Simple Unified Approach for Online and Near-Online Video Panoptic Segmentation (7 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04694?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers from Google propose Video-kMaX, a unified approach for online and near-online Video Panoptic Segmentation, comprising a within-clip segmenter and a cross-clip associater. By leveraging clip-kMaX and HiLA-MB for these components, this method establishes a new state-of-the-art on KITTI-STEP, VIPSeg, and VSPW datasets, bridging the gap between online and near-online segmentation approaches.

[### Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442?utm_source=tldrai)

Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, the authors introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time.

[### Choosing the right LLM for your use case and budget ‚Äî it‚Äôs not just about size (Sponsor)](https://bit.ly/3nXnURp)

It seems like a new LLM API launches every other day. But how do you know which is the best fit for your use case? Is bigger always better? What are the benefits of specialized models? How does model size affect latency? This [blog post by Inworld](https://bit.ly/3nXnURp) identifies 8 key factors for comparing large language models. [Read the article](https://bit.ly/3nXnURp)
