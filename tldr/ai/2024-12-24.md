### Headlines & Launches

[### New physics sim trains robots 430,000 times faster than reality (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/new-physics-sim-trains-robots-430000-times-faster-than-reality/?utm_source=tldrai)

Genesis, an open-source simulation platform, accelerates robot training 430,000 times faster than real-world conditions using text-generated 3D worlds. Developed by a team led by Carnegie Mellon University, it processes physics calculations 80 times faster than existing simulators using standard GPUs, facilitating rapid neural network training for robotics. Genesis uses Python and offers an accessible, non-proprietary solution for creating dynamic, physics-based environments without manual programming effort.

[### Waymo still doing better than humans at preventing injuries and property damage (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24324492/waymo-injury-property-damage-insurance-data-swiss-re?utm_source=tldrai)

Waymo's autonomous vehicles significantly outperform human drivers in safety, showing an 88% reduction in property damage and a 92% reduction in bodily injury claims according to a study that analyzed 25.3 million miles of driverless operation. Compared to new cars with advanced safety tech, Waymo still achieves an 86% reduction in property damage and 90% in bodily injury claims. The data supports the potential of autonomous vehicles to reduce traffic fatalities, though more extensive data is needed for comprehensive comparisons.
