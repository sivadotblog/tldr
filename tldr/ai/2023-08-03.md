### Headlines & Launches

[### Meta released AudioCraft: a code base for generative audio needs (3 minute read)](https://audiocraft.metademolab.com/?utm_source=tldrai)

AudioCraft is a single-stop code base for all your generative audio needs: music, sound effects, and compression.

[### White Castle will bring more AI to its drive-thrus (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23817406/white-castle-soundhound-ai-sliders?utm_source=tldrai)

White Castle plans to implement AI-enabled voice assistance at over 100 drive-thrus by 2024, utilizing technology from speech recognition company SoundHound. The system promises quicker order processing and offers customers the option to speak with human staff if errors occur. The initiative follows a successful proof-of-concept and will not lead to layoffs.

[### Generative AI services pulled from Apple App Store in China ahead of new regulations (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/generative-ai-services-pulled-from-apple-app-store-in-china-ahead-of-new-regulations?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple has removed numerous AI apps from its China App Store, including OpenCat, a ChatGPT client, ahead of new generative AI regulations in China. The upcoming regulations demand that AI apps secure an administrative license to operate in China. The new framework could deter smaller developers, potentially leaving the market to larger firms capable of managing compliance.

### Research & Innovation

[### Enhancing Brain Tumor Classification (6 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00491v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study presents a novel classification network that uses L2-normalized spatial attention to improve accuracy when identifying different types of brain tumors in MRI images.

[### Benchmarking YOLO-Based Object Detection Models (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13901v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study introduces "YOLOBench", a performance measure for over 550 models based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) method of object detection, tested across four unique datasets and hardware systems.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Efficient Vision Transformers with Focused Linear Attention (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/leaplabthu/flatten-transformer?utm_source=tldrai)

This research introduces a new 'Focused Linear Attention' method that makes Transformers more efficient and powerful. The researchers devised a new mapping function and rank restoration module that enhances model performance while keeping computational demands low.

[### Introducing Reasoning Segmentation: A New Task in AI (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/dvlab-research/lisa?utm_source=tldrai)

This study introduces a new AI task called 'reasoning segmentation' designed to generate segmentation masks from complex and implicit textual instructions. It presents a tool called LISA (Large-language Instructed Segmentation Assistant) as a demonstration. LISA combines the language generation capabilities of large language models with the ability to create segmentation masks.

[### How MIT‚Äôs Liquid Neural Networks can solve AI problems from robotics to self-driving cars (9 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-mits-liquid-neural-networks-can-solve-ai-problems-from-robotics-to-self-driving-cars/?utm_source=tldrai)

MIT CSAIL‚Äôs Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) are a compact AI that excels in robotics and autonomous vehicles. LNNs are adaptable, less computationally intensive, and outperform standard models in changing environments, but struggle with static databases.

[### Agentized LLMs will change the alignment landscape (4 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dcoxvEhAfYcov2LA6/agentized-llms-will-change-the-alignment-landscape?utm_source=tldrai)

The development of agentized LLMs like Auto-GPT and Baby AGI could rapidly advance AGI. These LLMs, which emulate human cognitive functions, pose new challenges for alignment and interpretability, yet offer unique interpretability because they process information in English.
