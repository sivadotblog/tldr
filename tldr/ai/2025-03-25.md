### Headlines & Launches

[### Roblox's new AI model can generate 3D objects (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/news/630977/roblox-cube-3d-objects-mesh-ai-text-prompt?utm_source=tldrai)

Roblox has open-sourced Cube 3D, an AI model that can generate 3D objects from text prompts, to enhance creation efficiency. Cube 3D uses tokenization techniques and is trained with licensed and publicly available datasets, plus Roblox experience data. Future iterations will incorporate multimodal inputs like images and videos.

[### New Reve Image Generator Beats AI Art Heavyweights MidJourney and Flux at a Penny Per Image (7 minute read)](https://decrypt.co/311375/new-reve-image-generator-beats-ai-art-heavyweights-midjourney-and-flux-at-a-penny-per-image?utm_source=tldrai)

Reve Image 1.0, an AI image generator, offers competitive pricing and impressive prompt adherence, realism, and versatility, potentially outperforming rivals like Midjourney and Ideogram. At $5 for 500 credits, it allows affordable generation of high-quality images but lacks an edit feature and mobile app, which may deter advanced users. Despite limited transparency about its team and technology, Reve remains a strong cost-effective choice for users seeking high-quality outputs without extensive technical know-how.

[### Introducing Together Chat: use DeepSeek R1 for free, hosted in North America (3 minute read)](https://www.together.ai/blog/together-chat?utm_source=tldrai)

Together Chat has launched a free consumer app that offers seamless interaction with top open-source models, including the new DeepSeek R1 for advanced reasoning. It supports web crawling, code generation with Qwen Coder 32B, and image creation using Flux Schnell, all accessible via a Progressive Web App.

[### Open-source Omni-modal Foundation Model (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/baichuan-inc/Baichuan-Omni-1.5?utm_source=tldrai)

The Baichuan Omni 1.5 model supports text, image, video, and audio inputs as well as text and audio outputs. This means it is another example of an any-to-any style model, sometimes referred to as natively multimodal. The model, like many, uses an interleaved multimodal tokens approach where different types of tokens are routed to different encoders/decoders that all get processed by some main auto-regressive model.

[### MCP (Model Context Protocol): Simply Explained In 5 Minutes (5 minute read)](https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/p/mcps-simply-explained?utm_source=tldrai)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT integrate with your everyday apps‚Äîturning them from isolated chatbots into powerful assistants with real-world capabilities. Instead of copying error logs into your AI, MCP lets you simply say "read my browser console and fix this bug" and the AI can directly access those tools. Behind the scenes, MCP works through a standard interface where providers like Slack, GitHub, and Sentry can create "adapters" that translate AI requests into API calls.

[### OpenAI's o1-pro is the company's most expensive AI model yet (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/openais-o1-pro-is-its-most-expensive-model-yet/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's o1-pro, a more computing-intensive version of its o1 reasoning AI, is now available in its developer API for select users at a premium cost. Priced at $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens, it offers better performance but has received mixed early reviews as it struggles with certain tasks. Despite improvements, internal benchmarks show only slight performance gains over the standard o1 model in coding and math.
