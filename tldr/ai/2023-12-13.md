### Headlines & Launches

[### Phi 2 available in Azure model studio (6 minute read)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models/?utm_source=tldrai)

Phi 2 is the next generation in the series of tiny language models from Azure trained primarily on synthetic data. The 2.7B parameter model matches the performance of 13B parameter models. The challenge here is detecting and mitigating ‚Äútest set rephrasing‚Äù, but in either case, the model is quite powerful.

[### Mistral platform (3 minute read)](https://mistral.ai/news/la-plateforme/?utm_source=tldrai)

Mistral now has an API with new models, an embedding, and instruction-tuned models. It has an unreleased medium-sized model that outperforms GPT-3.5.

[### OpenAI Leaders Warned Of Abusive Behavior Before Sam Altman‚Äôs Ouster (5 minute read)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/warning-from-openai-leaders-helped-trigger-sam-altman-s-ouster/ar-AA1ldAfV?utm_source=tldrai)

A group of senior leaders at OpenAI raising concerns to the board about Sam Altman's allegedly psychologically abusive behavior, which included creating chaos and pitting employees against each other, along with accusations of Altman's dishonesty in board communications, led to his brief firing. Altman's reinstatement followed overwhelming employee support and threats of mass resignations, but the incident has left uncertainties within the company and questions about its future direction.

### Research & Innovation

[### Enhancing NeRF Training with Image Correspondence Priors (3 minute read)](https://yxlao.github.io/corres-nerf/?utm_source=tldrai)

CorresNeRF introduces a novel approach to improve Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) performance, especially in scenarios with limited input views. By utilizing image correspondence priors for supervision, this method refines NeRF training, resulting in enhanced photometric and geometric accuracy.

[### Anomaly Detection Using Diffusion Models (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06607v1?utm_source=tldrai)

DiAD leverages the power of diffusion models to detect anomalies. It uniquely combines a pixel-space autoencoder, a Semantic-Guided (SG) network, and a feature-space extractor to accurately detect and localize anomalies in multi-class settings.

[### Vision-Language Modeling with Reduced GPU Usage (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06401v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have introduced Compound Text-Guided Prompt Tuning (TGP-T), a new method for Vision-Language Models like CLIP. TGP-T reduces GPU memory usage significantly while improving performance. It achieves this by optimizing prompts with text supervision, allowing more flexibility and efficiency in handling a variety of categories.

[### Making 3D Editing Easier with 2D Image Processing (2 minute read)](https://felixcheng97.github.io/AGAP/?utm_source=tldrai)

AGAP is a new method that simplifies 3D editing. By using a 2D image, called a canonical image, AGAP allows users to easily edit 3D scenes without re-optimizing for each change.

[### Enhancing Text-Prompted 3D Content Creation (4 minute read)](https://liuff19.github.io/Sherpa3D/?utm_source=tldrai)

Sherpa3D is a groundbreaking framework that improves 3D content creation from text prompts. It combines the strengths of 2D and 3D diffusion models, using coarse 3D knowledge to guide the creation process. This results in high-quality, diverse, and geometrically consistent 3D assets, overcoming the limitations of existing methods.

[### Accelerating Neural Volumetric Video Research (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/zju3dv/easyvolcap?utm_source=tldrai)

EasyVolcap is a PyTorch library for accelerating neural volumetric video research, particularly in areas of volumetric video capturing, reconstruction, and rendering.

### Miscellaneous

[### Interoperable Authentication Protocol (6 minute read)](https://www.artifact.io/iap?utm_source=tldrai)

Coordinating communication between language models and users is key given how fast model capabilities are advancing. The Interoperable Authorization Protocol (IAP) aims to address this by establishing secure, adaptable communication channels and a consent management system. This open-source approach encourages collaboration in the AI community to align AI operations with diverse human values and goals.

[### MIT Group Releases White Paper On Governance Of AI (9 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2023/mit-group-releases-white-papers-governance-ai-1211?utm_source=tldrai)

A committee of MIT leaders and scholars has released policy briefs providing a framework for U.S. AI governance, advocating the extension of existing regulatory and liability approaches to oversee AI effectively. Their proposal aims to enhance U.S. leadership in AI, minimize potential harms, and encourage beneficial AI applications, emphasizing the need for a clear purpose and intent definition in AI tools and suggesting possible new oversight structures.

[### On Platform Shifts and AI (4 minute read)](https://caseyaccidental.com/on-platform-shifts-and-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

In the 2022 TCV Engage Summit, the conversation highlighted that while AI represents a technological shift, it lacks a new distribution channel, which is crucial for creating significant consumer opportunities. Current AI innovations must rely on traditional distribution methods, favoring established companies or innovative startups, but the potential for new distribution platforms remains uncertain.
