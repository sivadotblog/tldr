### Headlines & Launches

[### Sutton and Barto win the Turing Award (8 minute read)](https://www.acm.org/media-center/2025/march/turing-award-2024?utm_source=tldrai)

The two have done years of groundbreaking research and education in Reinforcement Learning.

[### QwQ 32B reasoning model (4 minute read)](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwq-32b/?utm_source=tldrai)

The Qwen team has trained an open weight, Apache 2.0, licensed model that performs on par with DeepSeek R1 and better than many of the larger distill models. They found that by building on outcome based rewards with formal verification and test-case checks, the model can continuously improve at math and code. Also, by mixing in general instruction following data later in RL training, the model can still align with human preference.

[### Infrared Image Super-Resolution (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01187v1?utm_source=tldrai)

DifIISR enhances infrared image super-resolution using diffusion models, integrating perceptual priors and thermal spectrum regulation to improve both visual fidelity and machine perception.

[### Improving Scalability of Pipeline Parallelism with Memory Optimization (30 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01328?utm_source=tldrai)

Pipeline Parallelism is a great strategy when sharding models across many GPUs. However, it uses substantial memory. This paper, which comes with code, uses offloading to effectively reduce the memory required when the number of shards increases making PP a strong alternative to TP for large model training.
