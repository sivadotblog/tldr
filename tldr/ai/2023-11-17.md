### Headlines & Launches

[### DeepMind and YouTube Partner on Music Synthesis (12 minute read)](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/transforming-the-future-of-music-creation/?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepMind has been working on music synthesis for a number of years and now just announced a powerful new system. Interestingly, much of the boost came from a data partnership with revenue sharing. Meaning it trained on artists‚Äô music for a better performing model while ensuring that the artists were compensated. The model will be available in a number of forms, one of which is via YouTube Shorts Studio.

[### Meta Announces Video Editing and Creation Models (6 minute read)](https://ai.meta.com/blog/emu-text-to-video-generation-image-editing-research/?utm_source=tldrai)

Oftentimes when you generate an output image with a generative model, it isn‚Äôt quite what you were looking for. However, editing that image with the same model is extremely challenging. Meta had a key insight that treating all generations as instructions allows editing capabilities to emerge. This, coupled with the new simplicity of the model architecture, is quite a nice step forward.

[### Microsoft Launches A Deepfake Creator (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/15/microsoft-launches-a-deepfakes-creator/?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft launched Azure AI Speech text-to-speech avatar at the Microsoft Ignite 2023 event, allowing users to create photorealistic avatars that can speak scripted text in various languages using text-to-speech technology.

### Research & Innovation

[### Improving Video Question Answering with a New Method (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15747v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers found that Large Language Models sometimes make errors in Video Question Answering (VideoQA) by depending too much on the language and ignoring the actual video content. To solve this, researchers introduced a new approach called Flipped-VQA, which makes these models better understand the relationship between videos, questions, and answers, leading to more accurate results.

[### A Dataset to Understand Student Behavior (6 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16267v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have expanded the SCB-ST-Dataset4, which captures activities like hand-raising, reading, and writing to better understand and detect students' classroom behaviors using deep learning.

[### Sentence Alignment for Large Documents (11 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08982v1?utm_source=tldrai)

SentAlign is a new tool for aligning sentences in large parallel documents, capable of handling thousands to tens of thousands of sentences efficiently.
