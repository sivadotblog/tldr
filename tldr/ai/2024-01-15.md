### Research & Innovation

[### I am a Strange Dataset: Metalinguistic Tests for Language Models (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05300?utm_source=tldrai)

There is a challenge type of phrase that is self-referential, for example, ‚Äúthe last word in this sentence is is‚Äù. Language models struggle immensely with this sort of language. This paper introduces a dataset and some evaluations to help improve language models' metalinguistic capability.

[### PIXART-Œ¥: Fast and Controllable Image Generation with Latent Consistency Models (26 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05252?utm_source=tldrai)

PixArt has been a parallel research direction to the popular Stable Diffusion set of image generation models. This work brings faster generation with Latent Consistency Models and better control with ControlNet style prompting.

[### Sleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training (21 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic released some really interesting research that purposefully poisons a language model with a sleeper phrase that elicits some behavior. It found that it was unable to ‚Äúalign‚Äù this sort of model with the powerful system used for its production models. Meaning, once the model had been poisoned, bad behavior could not be removed with current tools.

[### Multilingual OCR line detector (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/surya?utm_source=tldrai)

Line detection is where you put a bounding box around a line of text in an image or PDF. Surya is an extremely powerful multi-lingual line detection model.

[### Automatically narrate your life (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/cbh123/narrator?utm_source=tldrai)

Using a combination of GPT4-V, top-of-the-line text-to-speech, and some computer capture software, you can have folks like David Attenborough narrate everything that is happening in your life.

[### Animate Anyone Replication (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/MooreThreads/Moore-AnimateAnyone?utm_source=tldrai)

AnimateAnyone is an amazing video control model that takes an image and skeleton motion as input and then animates the person in the control image. This code is an open replication of that work.
