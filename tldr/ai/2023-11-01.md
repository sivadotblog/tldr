### Headlines & Launches

[### Isomorphic teases the next version of AlphaFold (8 minute read)](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/a-glimpse-of-the-next-generation-of-alphafold?utm_source=tldrai)

AlphaFold is an amazing model for science. The new work by Isomorphic Labs (a spin off from Google) extends it beyond just proteins and improves overall performance.

[### Artists Lose First Round Of Copyright Case (3 minute read)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/artists-copyright-infringement-case-ai-art-generators-1235632929/?utm_source=tldrai)

A federal judge dismissed most claims in a landmark lawsuit where artists accused generative AI art generators of unauthorized image use, pinpointing deficiencies in copyright infringement accusations against Midjourney and DeviantArt.

[### OpenAI's Ilya Sutskever on Preventing Rogue Superintelligence (15 minute read)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/26/1082398/exclusive-ilya-sutskever-openais-chief-scientist-on-his-hopes-and-fears-for-the-future-of-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has shifted his focus from building the next model like GPT to figuring out how to avoid future artificial superintelligence from behaving undesirably. He believes the reality of AI surpassing human intelligence is imminent and anticipates technologies that will allow humans and AI to merge. Sutskever and his team at OpenAI are actively working on "superalignment", a set of procedures to control future AI technology.

### Research & Innovation

[### A Mask Propagation Technique for Video Semantic Segmentation (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18954v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The study introduces MPVSS, a method for segmenting video content that reduces computational load by focusing on key frames and then predicting masks for other frames based on these key ones.

[### A Deep Dive into Medical Visual Question Answering (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19061v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The study assesses how well GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V) answers questions related to medical images from various sources, such as X-rays and CT scans.

[### Improving the Reliability of Diffusion Models (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19427v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have found ways to use diffusion models to make long-term plans, but these plans aren't always realistic or safe. This study introduces a method to fix those unreliable plans, using a tool called the "restoration gap".

### Engineering & Resources

[### Improving Multi-modal LLMs (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/yuchenliu98/comm?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers dived deep into the visual encoders used in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and discovered that certain features from CLIP and DINO models are especially effective for detailed visual tasks. They then introduced COMM, a strategy that combines the strengths of both models.

[### A New Image Denoising Approach (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/HyemiEsme/PUCA?utm_source=tldrai)

The study introduces PUCA, a new self-supervised denoising approach that maintains J-invariance, a critical aspect for effective denoising.

[### Efficient Video Understanding (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/renshuhuai-andy/testa?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces TESTA, a method designed to speed up the process of understanding long videos by combining similar frames and patches. Using TESTA, researchers managed to greatly reduce the computational load and improve performance in matching paragraphs to videos and answering questions about long videos.
