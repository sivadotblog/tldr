Your AI app needs data from other APIs. How do you get it?

Most developers slog through a spaghetti of scripts and a dozen documentation pages to build a pipeline that breaks two weeks later.

What if you could [build complex automations](https://n8n.io/langchain/?utm_source=paid&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr-newslertter-langchain) 10x faster, without fighting APIs?

The new integration between [n8n](https://n8n.io/langchain/?utm_source=paid&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr-newslertter-langchain%5C) and Langchain lets you [build smart, context-aware LLM apps](https://n8n.io/langchain/?utm_source=paid&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr-newslertter-langchain) and integrate them with workflows.

Trigger your apps with precise, refined data. Use the outputs for enhanced automated actions. It‚Äôs super easy, even if you‚Äôre not super technical.

### Research & Innovation

[### Making Multi-modal LLMs Work for Different Tasks (17 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00582v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Multi-modal Large Language Models excel in many tasks but often struggle to pinpoint specific objects in images. Researchers have developed a way to improve this by turning object locations into text and training the model with special tasks.

[### Efficient Large-Scale 3D Scene Reconstruction (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00874?utm_source=tldrai)

Rebuilding large 3D scenes, especially when some data is missing, is crucial for self-driving cars. This new method, PC-NeRF, combines two modules to optimize the reconstruction at multiple levels, ensuring detailed 3D models even with incomplete data.

[### Generalist robot policy (20 minute read)](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

A robot's policy is the guiding algorithm that determines how it acts. Typically these are robot and task specific. This makes it hard for robotics to adapt. This new work from Google shows a single (55B parameter) policy that can perform 160k+ different tasks.

### Miscellaneous

[### Large world models for self driving (8 minute read)](https://wayve.ai/thinking/scaling-gaia-1/?utm_source=tldrai)

Most self driving systems have been large combinations of rules-based, expert systems, and learned modules. This work by Wayve shows a 9B joint video, action, and text model that performs extremely well in diverse scenarios.

[### Is Data Still A Moat? (2 minute read)](https://matt-rickard.com/is-data-still-a-moat?utm_source=tldrai)

Generative AI is reshaping the traditional value placed on vast data collections. As large language models can be fine-tuned with minimal data and even generate synthetic datasets, the uniqueness and importance of proprietary data may be waning.

[### AI Is Getting Better At Hurricane Forecasting (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/ai-is-getting-better-at-hurricane-forecasting/?utm_source=tldrai)

Hurricane Lee's path was predicted by AI-based models from Nvidia, Huawei, and DeepMind. These AI models, which analyze patterns from historical atmospheric data, have shown comparable or sometimes better performance in storm tracking than conventional models, delivering rapid results in minutes instead of hours, and might play a significant role in official forecasts in the coming years.
