### Headlines & Launches

[### Meta Plans Standalone AI Chatbot App (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/meta-is-reportedly-planning-a-standalone-ai-chatbot-app/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta is reportedly developing a standalone AI chatbot app for Meta AI, expected to launch in the next fiscal quarter. The company also plans to introduce a paid subscription with additional features.

[### OpenAI announces GPT-4.5, warns it's not a frontier AI model (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/news/620021/openai-gpt-4-5-orion-ai-model-release?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has launched GPT-4.5 as a research preview for ChatGPT Pro users. The model offers enhanced writing capabilities and improved world knowledge but is not considered a frontier model. It will roll out to Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users in the coming weeks.

[### GPT 4.5 System Card (75 minute read)](https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-4-5-system-card.pdf?utm_source=tldrai)

The newest model from OpenAI is their largest yet. It was trained on the same recipe as 4o, which means it is a multimodal model. It is likely the last large pre-training run that OpenAI releases. They claim it isn't a frontier model, but don't provide much explanation. They do show that it has significantly reduced hallucinations compared to previous model generations.
