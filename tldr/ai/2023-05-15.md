### Research & Innovation

[### Prompt Injection Explained (17 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/prompt-injection-explained/?utm_source=tldrai)

A full introduction into prompt injection, a term used in the field of AI to describe the practice of deliberately inserting specific inputs into an AI model to obtain desired outputs, including why it‚Äôs an important issue and why many of the proposed solutions won‚Äôt be effective.

[### Enhancing Image Quality with Prior Knowledge (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07015?utm_source=tldrai)

A new technique has been created that enhances the quality of blurry images using pre-set text-to-image models. This method smartly uses a special encoder and doesn't need to change the existing image-making model, saving training time. Plus, users can control image quality with one simple adjustment. The strategy also handles larger images better than previous methods. Tests with both artificial and real-world images prove it's more effective than current solutions.

[### Instruct Blip (33 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06500?utm_source=tldrai)

Blip is a model developed by Salesforce that can be used for vision and language tasks. Following the line of work in language models that tunes them to follow instructions, we can also tune these vision language models to follow instructions. This dramatically improves the performance, and in this case it even outperforms the published numbers of GPT-4.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Detection through reasoning (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/OptimalScale/DetGPT?utm_source=tldrai)

When detecting objects in a scene, you usually pull from a set of predefined classes. Also, asking questions about the scene is challenging. In this case, we can use powerful language models (Vicuna) with instruction tuned detectors to reason about queries and detect objects as a result.

[### Open-LLaMa (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/s-JoL/Open-Llama?utm_source=tldrai)

The complete training code of the open-source high-performance Llama model, including the full process from pre-training to RLHF.

[### PaLM (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/conceptofmind/PaLM?utm_source=tldrai)

An open-source implementation of Google's PaLM models.

[### Cohere LLM university (6 minute read)](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/llmu?utm_source=tldrai)

Cohere is a startup that offers a language model API similar to other big players. They have a set of powerful models that you can use to build applications. This language model university is designed to bring you up to speed on modern language models and show how to build on them with cohere's tools.

[### How Long Will Big Tech Open Source AI Handouts Last? (6 minute read)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/12/1072950/open-source-ai-google-openai-eleuther-meta/?utm_source=tldrai)

This article dives into how long big tech companies will continue to provide open-source AI material, especially in light of the recent leaked memo suggesting that Google and OpenAI will lose out to the open-source community.

[### Chatbots Still Struggle With Negation (7 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/ai-like-chatgpt-are-no-good-at-not-20230512/?utm_source=tldrai)

Despite the remarkable capabilities of AI models like ChatGPT, they do have limitations. In particular, they lack common sense reasoning and are unable to understand context beyond the immediate text they are processing. This inability can lead to nonsensical, inconsistent, or biased responses. This is due to the training method, which involves learning from vast amounts of text data but doesn't include an understanding of the world or the ability to reason about it. Researchers are exploring ways to improve these aspects of AI, but significant challenges remain.
