### Headlines & Launches

[### Google's leaked document "we won't win but OpenAI won't either" (8 minute read)](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither?utm_source=tldrai)

It's not clear if this is authentic, but the message is real. Open source models are gaining quickly on closed models and "eating their lunch". So what should these large orgs do? One idea is to be the ecosystem leader similar to Android or Pytorch. In any case it is a powerful example of the community building things that are useful for them.

[### White House Pushes Tech CEOs To Limit Risks Of AI (4 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/04/technology/us-ai-research-regulation.html?utm_source=tldrai)

The White House on Thursday pushed Silicon Valley chief executives to limit the risks of artificial intelligence, telling them they have a ‚Äúmoral‚Äù obligation to keep products safe, in the administration‚Äôs most visible effort yet to regulate AI.

Language models that write code are the silent powerhouses of the recent AI revolution. ChatGPT‚Äôs impressive reasoning abilities come, in part, from its code writing prowess. However, no open model has gotten as high as the new Star Coder model on the tough HumanEval benchmark. An impressive model, with open access weights, and a wide array of features like fill-in-the-middle and dialog. You can also run it on HuggingChat.

### Research & Innovation

[### RLHF explained by the best (25 minute read)](https://huyenchip.com/2023/05/02/rlhf.html?utm_source=tldrai)

We here at TLDR are huge fans of Chip's writing. Every blog is a gold mine of information. This one is no different, covering one of the hottest topics in AI today in great detail. RLHF stands for Reinforcement learning from human feedback. It's a way to get a language model to express uncertainty and change the way it produces text to be more in-line with what humans want. It's tricky and hard to get right.

[### Distill or Annotate to get the best small model (23 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01645?utm_source=tldrai)

When you want to train a language model, often bigger is better. When you want to use one in production, smaller wins out. To get a smaller model to match the performance of a larger one we can either distill the model down or annotate more data to further tune the smaller model. Even though distilling the model (e.g., by removing weights) is pretty expensive - it's often more cost effective than trying to train the smaller model more.

[### Use your font color to control image generation (3 minute read)](https://rich-text-to-image.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

In this study, the researchers investigate the use of various formatting elements found in rich text, such as font size, color, style, and footnotes, for generating images from text. Their approach allows for easy control of local styles, accurate color creation, and additional information when working with lengthy text prompts. By utilizing these aspects of rich text, the researchers aim to enhance the process of turning text into images effectively and efficiently.

Databerry provides a user-friendly solution to quickly setup a semantic search system over your personal data without any technical knowledge.

[### VPGTrans: Transfer Visual Prompt Generator across LLMs (4 minute read)](https://vpgtrans.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

Creating new vision-language AI models can be very expensive and time-consuming, but researchers found a way to make it cheaper by transferring parts from existing models. The new method, called VPGTrans, is much faster and uses way less data, making it easier to create powerful AI models without breaking the bank.

[### DeepDoctection (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/deepdoctection/deepdoctection?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepDoctection is a Python library that orchestrates document extraction and document layout analysis tasks using deep learning models.

[### ML observability from your notebook (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix?utm_source=tldrai)

Data drift, model drift, model performance, or human preference! It's all important for deploying real world systems, but it's hard to get right. This is a neat tool that could help. It's a notebook based way to track different metrics about your models and data in production.

### Miscellaneous

[### Open pass@20 code model from Replit (HuggingFace)](https://huggingface.co/replit/replit-code-v1-3b?utm_source=tldrai)

There has been a lot of buzz recently around the mosaic ML platform. This model, which is surprisingly capable for its size, is one artifact of that platform. It was trained by former Google program synthesis folks who have moved to Replit. It gets very competitive performance with larger models on the standard HumanEval benchmark.

[### StarCoder Released (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model/?utm_source=tldrai)
