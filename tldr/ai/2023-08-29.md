[### Gretel‚Äôs Tabular LLM generates realistic, correlated datasets from scratch - no training data required (Sponsor)](https://gretel.ai/tabular-llm?utm_source=tldr-ai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=tabular%20llm&amp;utm_content=tldr-20230829)

You need realistic data for demos, testing, and pre-production environments. Now you can use AI to get that data instantly, securely, and cost-effectively. Gretel's novel [tabular LLM](https://gretel.ai/tabular-llm?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship&utm_campaign=tabular%20llm&utm_content=tldr-20230829) was trained on half a trillion tokens to efficiently simulate tabular data:

‚ú® Create a brand new, correlated dataset with the correct data types, based on [a prompt, SQL schema, or query.](https://gretel.ai/tabular-llm?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship&utm_campaign=tabular%20llm&utm_content=tldr-20230829)

‚ú® Expand existing data by automatically [adding columns and records](https://gretel.ai/tabular-llm?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship&utm_campaign=tabular%20llm&utm_content=tldr-20230829). Replace nulls and missing fields with realistic values.

‚ú® Build datasets for [different regions](https://gretel.ai/tabular-llm?utm_source=tldr-ai&utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship&utm_campaign=tabular%20llm&utm_content=tldr-20230829): names, email domains, addresses, companies...
