### Headlines & Launches

[### Intel announces Aurora GenAI (2 minute read)](https://wccftech.com/intel-aurora-genai-chatgpt-competitor-generative-ai-model-with-1-trillion-parameters/?utm_source=tldrai)

Intel has announced Aurora GenAI, its competitor to AI models like ChatGPT, boasting a massive 1 trillion parameters. Aimed at complex tasks, the model promises enhanced conversation, translation, summarization, and coding abilities. It's part of Intel's grand AI strategy, with collaborations from academic and research institutions.

[### Governance Of Superintelligence (3 minute read)](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence#SamAltman?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI predicts AI systems could surpass expert skills in most domains within a decade. To manage this, they propose three strategies: global coordination of AI development, an international authority for superintelligence, and research into making superintelligence safe. While supporting smaller-scale AI development, OpenAI emphasizes public oversight for powerful systems. Despite risks, they believe superintelligence is inevitable and can significantly improve the world.

[### Apple restricts use of OpenAI's ChatGPT for employees (1 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-restricts-use-chatgpt-wsj-2023-05-18?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple has reportedly limited its employees' use of external AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub's Copilot due to concerns over data security and leaks, according to the Wall Street Journal. This move comes amidst growing scrutiny over chatbot data management, specifically how user data is used to improve AI algorithms. OpenAI recently announced an "incognito mode" for ChatGPT to address these privacy concerns, as well as launching a ChatGPT app for iOS.

[### Train diffusion models with RL (4 minute read)](https://rl-diffusion.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

Reinforcement learning has been getting its day in the sun recently with a lot of work focusing on human feedback. It turns out that you can also use computational feedback as a reward model. And this work they use the LLaVA visual question answering system to give them a bert score for a number of different tasks. Interestingly they're able to dramatically improve the performance of a base diffusion model.

[### RLHF is not a magic wand for alignment (12 minute read)](https://www.scalevp.com/blog/cognitive-collective-rlhf-is-not-a-magic-wand-for-alignment?utm_source=tldrai)

What does it even mean to align something to human values? Is there such a thing as broad human values? This great post explores the ideas of using RL to align models. There is this idea in the community that since alignment isn‚Äôt well defined, the cohorts used to generate human feedback aren‚Äôt reproducible, and the fact that these models change somewhat substantially combine to mean alignment via RL might be harder than the hype leads us to believe.

[### CRITIC: A New Framework for Self-Correcting AI Language Models (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have introduced a system named CRITIC, which allows large language models (LLMs) to validate and improve their own outputs in a way similar to humans using tools for fact-checking or debugging. The process involves the model producing an initial output, interacting with tools to evaluate it, and then revising the output based on the feedback received, which has been proven to enhance the performance of LLMs in areas like question answering, program synthesis, and reducing toxicity.

[### Meta‚Äôs Voice Recognition for +1100 languages (4 minute read)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/multilingual-model-speech-recognition/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta scientists have made a breakthrough in teaching machines how to understand and speak thousands of languages, thanks to a project called Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS). The technology, which uses a self-learning system and a database of over 1,100 languages, aims to make information more accessible and help preserve many languages that are at risk of disappearing.

GPT-JSON is a wrapper around GPT that allows for declarative definition of expected output format. Set up a schema, write a prompt, and get results back as beautiful typehinted objects.

[### CoDi: Any-to-Any Generation via Composable Diffusion (3 minute read)](https://codi-gen.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

The authors introduce Composable Diffusion (CoDi), a unique AI model that can generate any mix of output types - like language, images, video, or audio - based on any combination of inputs, which sets it apart from traditional AI systems. Despite the lack of training data for many input-output combinations, CoDi successfully bridges the gap by aligning modalities in both input and output areas, allowing for simultaneous generation of interconnected modes, even when they were not part of the original training data.
