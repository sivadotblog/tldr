### Headlines & Launches

[### Apple Rumored to Follow ChatGPT With Generative AI Features on iPhone as Soon as iOS 18 (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple plans to start implementing generative AI technology in iOS in late 2024 at the earliest. The company will likely build hundreds of AI servers over the next two years. It will probably offer a combination of cloud-based and on-device AI. The time frame seems to line up with the release of iOS 18.

[### Introducing The Foundation Model Transparency Index (7 minute read)](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/introducing-foundation-model-transparency-index?utm_source=tldrai?utm_source=tldrai)

A team of researchers from Stanford, MIT, and Princeton has developed a transparency index to evaluate the level of transparency in commercial foundation models. The index, known as the Foundation Model Transparency Index (FMTI), assesses 100 different aspects of transparency, and the results indicate that there is significant room for improvement among major foundation model companies.

[### Shared fate: Protecting customers with generative AI indemnification (3 minute read)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/protecting-customers-with-generative-ai-indemnification?utm_source=tldrai)

Google is offering its customers two indemnities to mitigate the risks associated with generative AI. The first covers training data, protecting users against third-party intellectual property infringements. The second, generated output indemnity, covers IP claims made against content created using Google products, assuming responsible AI practices are followed.

### Research & Innovation

[### Evaluating Chatting Abilities of LLMs in Multi-Turn Dialogues (12 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13650v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study assesses the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage in human-like multi-turn conversations.

[### SALMONN: The AI Model Tuned to Understand the World of Sound (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13289v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces SALMONN, a unique AI model that combines text understanding with the ability to process various audio inputs, from speech to music. Not only does SALMONN perform well in trained audio tasks like speech recognition, it also shows impressive emergent skills like translating speech into untrained languages.

### Engineering & Resources

[### A New Approach to Lidar Panoptic Segmentation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/abhinavagarwalla/most-lps?utm_source=tldrai)

This project presents a novel detection-centric network for lidar panoptic segmentation (LPS) and tracking, moving away from the traditional segmentation-focused methods.

[### Improving Object Localization with a New Method (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/wpy1999/bas-extension?utm_source=tldrai)

Weakly supervised object localization helps find objects using only simple picture labels. The new Background Activation Suppression (BAS) method does this better by focusing on important parts of a picture and ignoring the rest, showing amazing results on several datasets.

[### Every app that adds AI looks like this (5 minute read)](https://botharetrue.substack.com/p/every-app-that-adds-ai-looks-like?utm_source=tldrai)

The AI boom has led to an oversaturation of startups with some raising massive funds on just a pitch deck, potentially indicating overhype and overvaluation. Experts caution that not all startups are innovators; many simply imitate. There should be more authenticity and clarity in AI branding and utility and less marketing of subpar AI tools as "magic".
