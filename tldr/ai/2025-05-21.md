[### Introducing TLMs: Task-specific Language Models that outperform LLMs (Sponsor)](https://fastino.ai/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=launch)

It doesn't really make sense to run a massive inference model for every small task. That's why [Fastino is introducing TLMs](https://fastino.ai/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=launch) - task-specific Language Models that are better, faster, and cheaper.

For defined tasks — such as summarization, function calling, and creative writing — TLMs are:

→ [99x faster than OpenAI](https://fastino.ai/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=launch)

→ 17% more accurate in task-specific benchmarks

→ Able to respond in <100ms for real-time applications

And because these models are small, they don't need to burn through GPUs - so you can pay just a single flat fee.

Don't miss out on the sensible next step in language model development. [Join the waitlist](https://fastino.ai/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=launch)

### Headlines & Launches

[### Google's "Jules" Enters AI Coding Race with Autonomous Agent Approach (3 minute read)](https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/jules/?utm_source=tldrai)

After launching a private beta in December, Google has released Jules to the public. The Gemini 2.5-powered tool clones entire repositories, then autonomously writes tests, fixes bugs, and builds features while developers work elsewhere. The agentic coding landscape is divided between synchronous pair-programming assistants and fully independent agents like Devin and Jules.

[### Exclusive: Google Sees Smart Glasses as the 'Next Frontier' for AI. And It's Not Working Alone (2 minute read)](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/exclusive-google-sees-xr-smart-glasses-as-the-ultimate-use-for-ai-with-warby-parker-samsung-and-xreal-on-deck/#ftag=CAD590a51e?utm_source=tldrai)

Google is reentering the smart glasses space with Android XR, integrating its Gemini AI to deliver real-time vision analysis, translation, and contextual assistance through AR glasses. The rollout will begin with Project Moohan, a mixed-reality headset built with Samsung, and followed by Project Aura, a developer-focused AR glasses prototype from Xreal, and future consumer AI glasses from partners like Warby Parker and Gentle Monster.

[### Apple will reportedly open up its local AI models to third-party apps (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/news/670868/apple-intelligence-ai-third-party-developer-access-model?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple plans to open up its large language models via a software development kit (SDK) so developers can use them in their own apps. The SDK will initially only run Apple's smaller on-device models and won't allow developers to access the models running in the cloud. It will likely be announced during the Worldwide Developers Conference event scheduled to start on June 9. The event will also include an announcement for an overhaul of iOS, macOS, and iPadOS that will make them more unified and resemble the Vision Pro operating system.

[### ‘Deep Think' boosts the performance of Google's flagship Google Gemini AI model (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/deep-think-boosts-the-performance-of-googles-flagship-google-gemini-ai-model/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google's Deep Think is an enhanced reasoning mode for the company's flagship Gemini 2.5 Pro model. It can consider multiple answers to questions before responding. Deep Think enabled Gemini 2.5 to top LifeCodeBench, a challenging coding evaluation, and it also beat OpenAI's o3 on MMMU, a test for skills like perception and reasoning. Google will be testing Deep Think with 'trusted testers' and conducting safety evaluations before rolling out the feature widely.

[### Poe Report Shows Rapid Shifts in AI Model Market Share (6 minute read)](https://poe.com/blog/spring-2025-ai-model-usage-trends?utm_source=tldrai)

A report from Quora's multi-model chat platform Poe revealed dramatic shifts in AI model usage from January to May 2025, with OpenAI's GPT-4.1 family and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro quickly gaining popularity while Anthropic's Claude models declined. The report highlights clear leaders across categories: general text is dominated by GPT-4.1, reasoning capabilities are led by Gemini 2.5 Pro, image generation is led by Google's Imagen3, and video creation is more split, with Runway currently leading.
