While rule-based code reviewers have been around for some time, [AI code reviews](https://www.greptile.com/blog/ai-will-not-replace-human-code-reviewers?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr&utm_term=tldr) are new and getting tons of attention. Many believe them to not only be a step-function change over predecessors like SonarQube, but a valid replacement of human code reviewers.

In this [blog post](https://www.greptile.com/blog/ai-will-not-replace-human-code-reviewers?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr&utm_term=tldr), Daksh Gupta ‚Äî co-founder of Greptile, an AI dev tools company ‚Äî attempts to understand what the code review process actually is, and if it will ever be automated away as so many AI companies claim it will.

### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI Reportedly Slated for $500 Million SoftBank Investment (2 minute read)](https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/openai-reportedly-slated-for-500-million-softbank-investment/?utm_source=tldrai)

SoftBank plans to invest $500 million in OpenAI's funding round, boosting its valuation to potentially $150 billion. Microsoft is also participating in the round, which reflects OpenAI's 1,700% revenue growth despite a projected $5 billion in losses.

[### OpenAI Is Growing Fast and Burning Through Piles of Money (5 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html?unlocked_article_code=1.OU4.99io.cnWQdfPhAjl2&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's recent financial documents reveal $300 million in monthly revenue, a 1,700% increase since early 2023, with annual sales projected to reach $3.7 billion. Despite this growth, the company expects to lose approximately $5 billion this year due to high operational costs. OpenAI is seeking $7 billion in a new funding round, which will value the company at $150 billion.

[### Altman reportedly trying to sell Biden on a slew of AI DCs (4 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/25/altman_5gw_dc/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is urging the Biden administration to build AI data centers consuming up to five gigawatts of power to maintain US technological leadership over China. The plan details constructing multiple data centers in the US. Other tech giants, like Microsoft and Amazon, are also securing nuclear power agreements to support their AI operations.

### Research & Innovation

[### Emu 3 open early fusion multimodal model (6 minute read)](https://emu.baai.ac.cn/about?utm_source=tldrai)

Emu 3 is a next token prediction model that outperforms SDXL on image synthesis, LlaVa-1.6 on image understanding, and OpenSora 2 on Video generation. It is a 9B parameter model trained on all these tasks in an interleaved manner, similar to Gemini.

[### Improved adaption of pretrained priors (12 minute read)](https://lotus3d.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

Using a pretrained diffusion model for tasks like depth estimation is extremely popular and powerful. This work shows how some of the previous methods were slightly wrong and improves performance while dramatically simplifying the modeling process.

[### Enhanced Place Recognition (39 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18049v1?utm_source=tldrai)

SegVLAD is an approach for visual place recognition that focuses on image segments rather than entire images.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Reducing Redundancy in LLMs (3 minute read)](https://vainf.github.io/maskllm-project-page/?utm_source=tldrai)

MaskLLM is a pruning method that reduces computational overhead in large language models by applying learnable sparsity.

[### Lean RL from PyTorch (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/leanrl?utm_source=tldrai)

A fork of CleanRL that has been optimized to use PyTorch's newest performance and stability features. It is dramatically faster while also being simpler to understand and extend.

[### New Benchmark for Video Language Models (2 minute read)](https://polyu-chenlab.github.io/etbench/?utm_source=tldrai)

E.T. Bench is a new benchmark designed to evaluate video language models on fine-grained, event-level tasks. Unlike previous benchmarks that focus on video-level questions, E.T. Bench covers a range of time-sensitive tasks across multiple domains.

[### Table Extraction using LLMs: Unlocking Structured Data from Documents (30 minute read)](https://nanonets.com/blog/table-extraction-using-llms-unlocking-structured-data-from-documents/?utm_source=tldrai)

This article highlights how large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing table extraction from complex documents, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods like OCR, rule-based systems, and machine learning. LLMs demonstrate flexibility and contextual understanding, notably enhancing accuracy in diverse and intricate table structures. Despite challenges like hallucination and high resource demands, combining traditional techniques with LLMs is currently the most effective strategy for automated table extraction.

[### The Other Bubble (40 minute read)](https://www.wheresyoured.at/saaspocalypse-now/?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft considered reallocating its US-based server power to GPUs for AI but ultimately scrapped the plan. Big Tech companies, including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, heavily invest in AI but primarily see underwhelming returns in generative AI applications. The industry's reliance on SaaS and the integration of AI tools, which often add little genuine utility while incurring high costs, highlights a growing desperation to maintain growth amidst a slowing market.
