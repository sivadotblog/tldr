Your AI features aren't truly useful unless they can automate work for users across their entire workflow.

For sales teams, this could mean enabling your AI agent to SEND\_EMAIL or UPDATE\_CRM\_RECORDS.

For support teams - QUERY\_CRM or CREATE\_TICKET

For project managers - UPDATE\_TASK or SEND\_SLACK\_MESSAGE.

Instead of having engineering build & optimize each function tool, use [ActionKit](https://www.useparagon.com/actionkit?utm_source=tldr_ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=2.18.2025).

It's a single API to give your AI agent [1000+ integration actions](https://www.useparagon.com/actionkit?utm_source=tldr_ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=2.18.2025).
