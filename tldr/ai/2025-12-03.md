### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### How AI Is Transforming Work at Anthropic (15 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic surveyed 132 of its own engineers and found 27% of Claude-assisted work wouldn't have happened otherwise, but not without costs. Mentorship is declining as Claude is becoming the first stop for questions. Engineers worry that the skills needed to supervise AI are the same ones atrophying from overuse.

[### Thoughts on AI progress (Dec 2025) (14 minute read)](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/thoughts-on-ai-progress-dec-2025?utm_source=tldrai)

The driver for further improvement will be continual learning. Solving continual learning will require incremental improvements, just like solving in-context learning. Labs will likely release something next year that they will call continual learning, but it will just be progress towards continual learning. Human-level continual learning may take another five to ten years of further progress.
