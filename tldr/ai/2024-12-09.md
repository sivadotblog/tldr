[### Introducing Web-World Models (Sponsor)](https://convergence.ai/training-web-agents-with-web-world-models-dec-2024/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=december_blog)

[Convergence's AI Agent, Proxy](https://convergence.ai/training-web-agents-with-web-world-models-dec-2024/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=december_blog) just achieved state of the art results on the WebVoyager benchmark, topping Claude Computer Use (Anthropic), Agent E (Emergence), and Runner H (H Company).

This benchmark consists of tasks like shopping, hotel booking, and map use. More importantly, it is conducted using real websites rather than simulated scenarios.

[Click here for early access to Proxy](https://convergence.ai/training-web-agents-with-web-world-models-dec-2024/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=december_blog), we are planning to open source it in the new year!
