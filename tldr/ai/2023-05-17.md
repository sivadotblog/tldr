### Headlines & Launches

[### Anthropic x Zoom (1 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/index/zoom-partnership-and-investment?utm_source=tldrai)

Zoom will invest in Anthropic and use Claude in a number of internal and external AI product offerings. The details of the deal aren't disclosed.

[### Sam Altman Testifies Before Congress (2 minute read)](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/16/tech/sam-altman-openai-congress/index.html?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman urged lawmakers to regulate artificial intelligence during a Senate panel hearing Tuesday, describing the technology‚Äôs current boom as a potential ‚Äúprinting press moment‚Äù but one that required safeguards.

### Research & Innovation

[### Tiny Stories, 1 Transformer block can generate stories (25 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759?utm_source=tldrai)

With models getting larger and more expensive we generally get better performance. But what happens if we go the other way? It turns out that tiny models can learn to generate coherent, novel, and grammatically correct stories. If you carefully construct the training data set and restrict the vocabulary to common words, you get some compelling completions from these miniscule models.

[### Improving Action Recognition: Exploring Multimodal Generalization (9 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07214?utm_source=tldrai)

This study introduces a new concept in egocentric action recognition called Multimodal Generalization (MMG), which focuses on how systems can adapt when data from certain sources is limited or missing. To investigate this, a new dataset called MMG-Ego4D was created, and new methods were developed to enhance the system's ability to generalize, potentially guiding future research in this area.

[### SuperICL: Making Big AI Models Work Better with Smaller Ones (6 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08848?utm_source=tldrai)

SuperICL is a new technique that helps massive AI models, like GPT-3 and GPT-4, to learn better by working with smaller, locally fine-tuned models. This approach not only boosts the performance of these big AI models on tasks, but also improves their stability and the abilities of smaller models, such as understanding different languages and explaining their decisions.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Guidance (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/guidance?utm_source=tldrai)

Guidance enables you to control modern language models more effectively and efficiently than traditional prompting or chaining.

[### Dify (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/langgenius/dify?utm_source=tldrai)

One API for plugins and datasets and one interface for prompt engineering and visual operation, all for creating powerful AI applications.

[### React hook to run LLM in the browser (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/r2d4/react-llm?utm_source=tldrai)

With the advent of WebGPU, you can now run hardware accelerated workflows in the browser. This repository exposes a React hook that downloads the model from the HuggingFace CDN, compiles to WASM, and runs inference.

### Miscellaneous

[### The first RNN on the Transformers library (15 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/rwkv?utm_source=tldrai)

The RWKV model is a linear attention model with built in recurrence. It is a powerful language model that runs fast with a theoretically long context window. The model development has an active discord community which now is more visible on the HuggingFace platform.

[### The Mobile AI Race (3 minute read)](https://archive.ph/qo2Ww?utm_source=tldrai)

Tech companies are racing to add AI to their mobile devices, however, high computing costs present a significant hurdle.

[### Metaphor systems Langchain integration (4 minute read)](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools/examples/metaphor_search.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Metaphor systems is pretty much the only internet scale neural search engine (powered purely by language models). This integration allows you to use that system as a retrieval backend for models in langchain.
