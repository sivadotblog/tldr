[### A Note from Baseten Co-founder and CEO Tuhin Srivastava (Sponsor)](https://www.baseten.co/blog/announcing-baseten-75m-series-c?utm_source=newsletter_tldr_ai&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=2025_02_20_tldr_ai)

Hey TLDR readers,

Our company Baseten, the platform for mission-critical inference, just [announced our $75 million Series C](https://www.baseten.co/blog/announcing-baseten-75m-series-c?utm_source=newsletter_tldr_ai&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=2025_02_20_tldr_ai), so I wanted to share thoughts on inference in 2025.

Every AI product will hit existential inference problems as it scales in production this year. These problems ‚Äì spanning model performance, multi-cluster infrastructure, and model management ‚Äì are hard to solve.

Our customers partner with us to bring high-quality AI products to market quickly. We're 100% focused on the non-negotiables of inference: speed, reliability, and cost-efficiency. That dedication has earned us incredible customers as we've grown fivefold year-over-year.

We'd love to have TLDR readers as [customers](https://www.baseten.co/talk-to-us/?utm_source=newsletter_tldr_ai&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=2025_02_20_tldr_ai) and [teammates](https://www.baseten.co/careers/?utm_source=newsletter_tldr_ai&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_campaign=2025_02_20_tldr_ai). Let's connect!

Cheers,

Tuhin
