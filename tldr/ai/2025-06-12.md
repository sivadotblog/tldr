There are plenty of digital analytics tools that ask you to trawl through heaps of data in search of an insight you might never find.

But what if instead of a tool, you had a team of always-on AI analysts that you lead?

[Amplitude AI Agents](https://www.amplitude.com/ai-agents-launch-online?utm_source=tldr-ads&utm_medium=ai-sponsored-newsletter&utm_campaign=2025-06-24-amer-webinar-ai-launch-simulive) are that and more. They identify conversion drops, design experiments, and take action. No more dashboard-digging.

[### Claude Squad (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad?utm_source=tldrai)

Claude Squad is a terminal app that manages multiple local agents in separate workspaces, allowing users to work on multiple tasks simultaneously. It can compute tasks in the background, manage instances and tasks in one terminal window, review changes before applying them, checkout changes before pushing them, and more. Each task gets its own isolated git workspace, so there can be no conflicts. A video demo is available in the repository.
