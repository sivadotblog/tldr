[### Could Google's Veo 3 be the start of playable world models? (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/could-googles-veo-3-be-the-start-of-playable-world-models/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google's latest video-generating model, Veo 3, could potentially be used for video games. World models are different from video-generation models - video-generation models synthesize realistic video sequences while world models simulate the dynamics of real-world environments. Veo 3 isn't quite a world model yet, but it could be used for cinematic storytelling and narrative prototyping. Google has plans to turn its multimodal foundation model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, into a world model.
