[### China's AI Data Center Boom Faces Collapse as Demand Falters (8 minute read)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/26/1113802/china-ai-data-centers-unused/amp/?utm_source=tldrai)

China's AI infrastructure boom has led to severe overcapacity, with 80% of computing resources across 500+ new data centers sitting unused. DeepSeek's R1 model fundamentally changed market dynamics by shifting demand from training-focused to inference-optimized hardware, rendering many facilities obsolete. Despite this market correction, China has continued to aggressively invest in infrastructure to compete with U.S. initiatives like the $500 billion Stargate project.
