### Headlines & Launches

[### Work smarter with your company knowledge in ChatGPT (6 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/introducing-company-knowledge/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's new 'company knowledge' feature for ChatGPT Business, Enterprise, and Edu brings context from connected apps together inside ChatGPT, giving users answers specific to their business. It is powered by a version of GPT-5 that is trained to look across multiple sources to give more comprehensive and accurate answers. Every response includes clear citations. The feature respects existing company permissions, so ChatGPT can only access what each user is already authorized to view.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### LLM Exchange Rates Updated (10 minute read)](https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/llm-exchange-rates-updated?utm_source=tldrai)

Testing implicit value systems across current LLMs reveals that almost all models value nonwhites over whites and women over men by large margins‚ÄîClaude Sonnet 4.5 values saving whites from terminal illness at 1/18th the level of South Asians, while GPT-5 shows near-perfect egalitarianism except for whites valued at 1/20th nonwhites. The methodology involved sending thousands of queries comparing hypothetical scenarios like "receive $X vs. save Y people from terminal illness," training a utility model on pairwise preferences without directly asking about values to avoid ethics filters, then calculating exchange rates, showing how many of one group equals another.

[### Context engineering is sleeping on the humble hyperlink (8 minute read)](https://mbleigh.dev/posts/context-engineering-with-links/?utm_source=tldrai)

One technique woefully underutilized by agents today is the humble hyperlink. Links are a powerful tool for context engineering because they are simple, flexible, and efficient. Developers don't need any new technology to start making linked content. Hyperlinks are such a powerfully efficient mechanism for information transversal that it is difficult to imagine a future of agents that doesn't include linked context.
