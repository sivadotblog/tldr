### Headlines & Launches

[### Coreweave raises $2.3B in debt collateralized by Nvidia chips (3 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/coreweave-raises-23-billion-debt-collateralized-by-nvidia-chips-2023-08-03/?utm_source=tldrai)

A clever strategy for financing that most AI companies cannot replicate is to use existing assets as a guarantee on debt. Since Coreweave owns hardware, they have a clever way to access debt markets and avoid equity sales.

[### IBM and NASA launch geospatial foundation model on HuggingFace (6 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/ibm-and-nasa-deploy-open-source-geospatial-ai-foundation-model-on-hugging-face/?utm_source=tldrai)

This model improved performance by 15% on a flood prediction task while mostly operating on satellite images. It is able to perform a few tasks that could be useful to folks building, such as crop classification.

[### Where Will AI Have The Biggest Impact? Healthcare (5 minute read)](https://a16z.com/2023/08/02/where-will-ai-have-the-biggest-impact-healthcare/?utm_source=tldrai)

Healthcare is 20% of the US economy, but the industry has been slow to adopt technology. With AI, healthtech companies no longer need to fight the uphill battle of training people on software. Instead, they can sell AI that acts like a person and takes more and more of the work off healthcare professionals‚Äô plates, enabling them to work on more interesting problems and practice at the top of their licenses.

### Research & Innovation

[### Improving Large Language Models for Error Recognition (15 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00436v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This research explores how large language models can recognize their own errors, particularly in multi-step reasoning problems, without needing external resources. The researchers developed a zero-shot verification method to identify errors and enhance performance in question-answering tasks.

[### SoftMoE (28 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00951?utm_source=tldrai)

SoftMoE is a new model architecture that improves upon sparse Mixture of Expert (MoE) models. It offers larger model capacity with lower costs by using a soft assignment method where each expert processes a subset of input tokens. SoftMoE outperforms standard Transformers and other MoE models in visual recognition tasks. It performs equally well compared to the ViT-Huge/14 model, but with a much lower inference cost. When scaled up, SoftMoE significantly increases model parameters while keeping inference time cost minimal, resulting in better performance. Plus, it's fully differentiable!

[### Training-Free Instance Segmentation (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00949v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This study introduces a new approach called Training-Free Instance Segmentation that can segment instances within images without the need for intensive training or detailed image annotations. The method provides competitive results without additional resources or increased computation costs by using pre-existing semantic segmentation models and refining the output through a learnable object boundary branch.
