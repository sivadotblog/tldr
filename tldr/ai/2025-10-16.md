[### Preparing for AI's economic impact: exploring policy responses (10 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/economic-policy-responses?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic gathered policy ideas from economists and experts to prepare for modest to dramatic job losses due to AI. Concrete proposals include $10,000 annual employer training grants, "token taxes" on AI-generated content, and sovereign wealth funds that give citizens stakes in AI revenues.

[### More Articles Are Now Created by AI Than Humans (5 minute read)](https://graphite.io/five-percent/more-articles-are-now-created-by-ai-than-humans?utm_source=tldrai)

Analysis of 65,000 web articles found AI-generated content surpassed human-written articles in November 2024, growing from near-zero to 39% within 12 months of ChatGPT's launch before plateauing since May 2024. The authors speculate the stagnation was due to poor SEO performance, but they were unable to measure the prevalence of AI-generated, human-edited articles.

[### Artisanal shims for the bitter lesson age (9 minute read)](https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2025/10/14/bitter-lesson-applied-ai/?utm_source=tldrai)

General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective by a large margin. Developers building and working with AI applications should be aware that the artisanal architecture they are building may become obsolete with the next model release. They should make a note of what is not scaling with compute and focus their artisanal ingenuity there. Custom architectures may be necessary for many applications, but build them with the knowledge that they may have to be thrown away when the next frontier model drops.

[### Why There Hasn't Been a ChatGPT Moment Yet in Manufacturing (28 minute read)](https://theshearforce.substack.com/p/why-there-hasnt-been-a-chatgpt-moment?utm_source=tldrai)

The software that manages the mathematical definitions in CAD software is called a geometry kernel. Whoever first develops a truly capable foundational AI model for CAD will control a critical layer of industry infrastructure. The problem is that this critical infrastructure layer is currently monopolized by a handful of players whose business depends on maintaining closed, proprietary systems. If the US wants to maintain its industrial competitiveness, it must recognize geometry kernels as strategic infrastructure, not just commercial software products. The market has had decades to produce an open alternative and hasn't, so a coordinated public investment may be justified.

[### Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity (20 minute read)](https://simonucl.notion.site/verbalized-sampling?utm_source=tldrai)

AI models collapse into repetitive, generic responses because human annotators systematically prefer familiar answers during training. This "typicality bias" explains why ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini all tell the same coffee joke. The solution is simple: prompt models to "generate 5 jokes with their corresponding probabilities." This "verbalized sampling" method increased creative diversity by roughly 2x and improved human evaluation scores by 26% across tasks from story writing to social simulation.

[### How Starcloud Is Bringing Data Centers to Outer Space (4 minute read)](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/starcloud/?utm_source=tldrai)

Starcloud, under NVIDIA Inception, plans to launch AI-equipped satellites to establish data centers in space, aiming for 10x lower energy costs and higher sustainability. Its 5-gigawatt orbital center will leverage solar energy and space's vacuum for cooling, conserving Earth's resources. This approach offers faster processing for applications like wildfire detection and Earth observation, utilizing NVIDIA's advanced GPUs for real-time data inference.

Oracle plans to offer computing firepower and a suite of bundled services that will make artificial intelligence useful for business. Investors have expressed concerns about how its newest deals rely heavily on OpenAI, which won't generate a profit until 2029. Oracle's long-term play is to sell an ecosystem of AI solutions to large enterprises. The company has taken on debt to finance its AI infrastructure build-out, further troubling investors. However, the company has a more varied business than many realize - pretty much all of the big model providers use its cloud in one form or another.
