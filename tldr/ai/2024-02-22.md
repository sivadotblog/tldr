### Headlines & Launches

[### HELM Instruct Benchmark (21 minute read)](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2024/02/18/helm-instruct.html?utm_source=tldrai)

The language modeling group at Stanford released a widely used benchmark called Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM). They also released a version for instruction following called HELM-Instruct. It is multidimensional, open-ended, and absolute.

[### Reddit Has A New AI Training Deal To Sell User Content (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/17/24075670/reddit-ai-training-license-deal-user-content?utm_source=tldrai)

Reddit has entered a licensing agreement worth approximately $60 million annually with an unnamed major AI company, granting the company access to its vast user-generated content.

[### Google Deepmind open sources Gemma based on Gemini (3 minute read)](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-open-models/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google has released the weights for its Gemma 2B and 7B parameter models, available via HuggingFace. The models are decoder-only Transformers trained on 2T and 6T tokens. They substantially outperform Llama 2 on a wide range of benchmarks and come in base and instruction-tuned versions.

### Research & Innovation

[### Multimodal LLM’s Ability to Understand Visual Data (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/unimodal4reasoning/chartvlm?utm_source=tldrai)

ChartX is a new tool for testing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) on their ability to interpret and reason with visual charts.

[### Combining Unsupervised Training and Supervised Fine-Tuning (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/architsharma97/dpo-rlaif?utm_source=tldrai)

This repo challenges the effectiveness of combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning in training. Using a more advanced model like GPT-4 for initial training can outperform the more complex two-step method.

[### 25+ LoRAs for Mistral that outperform GPT-4 (8 minute read)](https://predibase.com/blog/lora-land-fine-tuned-open-source-llms-that-outperform-gpt-4?utm_source=tldrai)

Predibase released 25 narrow task-specific LoRAs that each outperform GPT-4 on specific tasks. These task-specific LoRAs are built onto the Mistral 7B model. This is another piece of evidence to support the ability of local models to perform exceptionally well on exact tasks.

### Engineering & Resources

[### MultiModal Conversations Dataset (6 minute read)](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/mmcsg-dataset/?utm_source=tldrai)

Meta has released the MMCSG dataset, which has thousands of two-sided conversations recorded via the Aria glasses, to encourage research in various social audio and visual tasks.

[### MultiLora inference server (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/predibase/lorax?utm_source=tldrai)

Lorax is an inference server that supports hot-swapping LoRAs onto a single base model. This means a dramatic decrease in RAM while supporting a wide range of model tunes.

[### Evaluating LLMs in Games (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/jinhaoduan/gtbench?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces GTBench, a platform for testing LLMs like GPT-4 in various game scenarios to discover their strengths and weaknesses in strategic reasoning. While these models show promise in games based on probability, they struggle in deterministic games and vary in performance based on their design and training.
