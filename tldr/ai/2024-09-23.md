### Headlines & Launches

[### Prompting o1 (6 minute read)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning/how-reasoning-works?utm_source=tldrai)

This guide was missed in the excitement of OpenAI's new reasoning models. It shows how prompting this new model is different and requires simpler prompts and a more structured input context.

[### Contextual Retrieval (12 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic shows how to semantically chunk documents, which dramatically improves performance while only costing $1/million chunks due to caching.

[### Jony Ive confirms he's working on a new device with OpenAI (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/21/24250867/jony-ive-confirms-collaboration-openai-hardware?utm_source=tldrai)

Jony Ive is collaborating with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on a new AI hardware project. The venture could raise $1 billion by year-end and involves key former Apple designers. Specifics of the device remain undetermined, but it aims to leverage generative AI for advanced user interactions.

### Research & Innovation

[### Training Language Models to Self-Correct via Reinforcement Learning (32 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12917?utm_source=tldrai)

Deepmind has released a paper that shows promise, even if the actual results aren't state-of-the-art. It shows a reinforcement learning paradigm that can be used to help models self-correct when generating math and code.

[### Fine-Tuning Image-Conditional Diffusion Models is Easier than You Think (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11355?utm_source=tldrai)

Much work has been done to generalize pretrained image diffusion models into niche depth estimators and other image conditional models. This work found that by simplifying the problem and fixing a small bug, researchers were able to get substantially improved performance with less training compute.

[### Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries (21 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12640?utm_source=tldrai)

Another great Google paper that shows how to evaluate long context models. It is directionally similar to the recent work by Magic.

Image and text to 3D with mesh smoothing and PBR ready lighting

[### AI for JQ (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/taylorai/aiq?utm_source=tldrai)

Simple yet powerful tool to label, embed, and classify unlabeled text at the command line. It also works on streams which gives it the ability to receive piped input from other sources.

[### Kyutai Labs Releases Moshi Weights (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi?utm_source=tldrai)

The highly funded real-time assistant voice startup showed off its impressive tech a few months ago. It has now released a detailed technical report and several model artifacts including code and model weights.
