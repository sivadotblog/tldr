[### Humanloop: Ship differentiated LLM features and apps (Sponsor)](https://humanloop.com/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=20230621)

You‚Äôll need more than an OpenAI API key to ship AI products that are [fast, accurate, and unique](https://humanloop.com/?utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=20230621).

Large language models can ‚Äòhallucinate‚Äô or produce repetitive results if left unchecked. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs hard to build something that feels differentiated when everyone is using the same tech.

üí° [Humanloop](https://humanloop.com/?utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=20230621) is an LLM development platform that lets you [customize and optimize your LLM applications](https://humanloop.com/?utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=20230621):

* One API, multiple models and providers (ChatGPT, Claude, others)
* Use A/B testing to automatically find the best prompts and parameters
* Built-in versioning, logging, and collaboration for your prompt engineering
* Drive performance from user feedback
* Fine-tune models with a single click

### Research & Innovation

[### DeepMind's new robotics controller (12 minute read)](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/robocat-a-self-improving-robotic-agent?utm_source=tldrai)

Gato came out about a year ago and was immediately the talk of the town. RoboCat, a system built on top of Gato, is an embodied agent that can learn in as few as 100 steps for a new task. It seems like an exciting new step in language enabled robotics.

[### A Novel Approach to Collaborative Image Recognition (9 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09607v1?utm_source=tldrai)

PhotoBook is an interactive game in which two players find common images from their own private sets, pushing machines to learn human-like communication around visual context. The approach, based on the DeBERTa model and CLIPScore features, bypasses the need for reference chains, directly predicting whether an image is shared.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Autolabel (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/refuel-ai/autolabel?utm_source=tldrai)

Autolabel is a Python library to label, clean and enrich text datasets with any Large Language Models (LLM) of your choice.

[### LOMO: Efficient LLM Training (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/openlmlab/lomo?utm_source=tldrai)

This research introduces LOw-Memory Optimization (LOMO), an optimizer designed to dramatically decrease the resources needed for Large Language Models (LLMs) training, a process that currently requires extensive GPU resources. LOMO's innovative approach allows the fine-tuning of a 65 billion parameter model using just a single machine with 8 RTX 3090 GPUs, each with 24GB memory, reducing memory usage to just 10.8% of the standard method.

[### Clip2Protect: A Method for Protecting Facial Privacy (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/fahadshamshad/clip2protect?utm_source=tldrai)

The Clip2Protect project introduces an innovative two-step approach to ensure facial privacy, especially in an age of powerful face recognition systems. It creates 'makeup' faces that look natural, yet fool facial recognition software, showing significantly better performance than previous privacy-enhancing methods.

[### Asset Managers Pressure Tech Companies Over AI Misuse (3 minute read)](https://archive.ph/tENu3?utm_source=tldrai)

Institutional investors are increasing pressure on technology companies to take responsibility for the potential misuse of artificial intelligence as they become concerned about the liability for human rights issues linked to the software.

[### Need to Dedup lots of data? (14 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/dedup?utm_source=tldrai)

The quality of the training mix for AI models is key to getting good performance. In code models, deduplication of data tends to matter quite a bit. It's not clear if it matters as much for text. However, in any case, this blog presents a great description of the techniques used to deduplicate large data sets of text-like data.
