[### MIT Research: AI could drive fraud losses to $40 billion by 2027 (Sponsor)](https://plaid.com/ai-fraud-detection-mit/?utm_source=TLDRAI&amp;utm_medium=PaidNewsletter&amp;utm_campaign=TLDRAI_Paid_Newsletter_Ad_Buy&amp;utm_content=MIT_AI_Fraud_Report)

Generative AI has turned financial fraud into an industrial operation. Voice cloning now takes just an hour of YouTube footage and an $11 subscription. Synthetic identity fraud already costs banks $6 billion annually. And fraudsters are scaling attacks using AI tools that traditional defenses can't handle.

Plaid and MIT Technology Review's [new research](https://plaid.com/ai-fraud-detection-mit/?utm_source=TLDRAI&utm_medium=PaidNewsletter&utm_campaign=TLDRAI_Paid_Newsletter_Ad_Buy&utm_content=MIT_AI_Fraud_Report) reveals the true scope of AI-powered fraud‚Äîand why current prevention methods are like "bringing a stick to a gunfight."

The report looks at current fraud tactics‚Äîfrom credential-stuffing automation to AI-generated deepfakes targeting elderly victims‚Äîand [how organizations are fighting back](https://plaid.com/ai-fraud-detection-mit/?utm_source=TLDRAI&utm_medium=PaidNewsletter&utm_campaign=TLDRAI_Paid_Newsletter_Ad_Buy&utm_content=MIT_AI_Fraud_Report) with their own AI systems.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Why Stacking Sliding Windows Can't See Very Far (20 minute read)](https://guangxuanx.com/blog/stacking-swa.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Modern language models use a building block called sliding window attention to handle long texts efficiently. The effective memory of these models has fundamental limitations. They struggle to use information from more than about 1,500 words ago, far less than the theoretical 100,000. This is because information gets diluted as it spreads through the network, and residual connections create an exponential barrier that blocks distant information.

[### RAG is Dead, Context Engineering is King (71 minute read)](https://www.latent.space/p/chroma?utm_source=tldrai)

In this interview, Jeff Huber from Chroma talks about what matters in vector databases, why modern search for AI is different, and how to ship systems that don't rot as context grows. Context engineering is the job of figuring out what should be in the context window at any given LLM generation step. It involves an inner loop, setting up the context window 'this time', and an outer loop that involves getting better at filling the context window with only relevant information.

[### Perplexity Is Launching a New Revenue-Share Model for Publishers (2 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/perplexity-ai-search-publisher-revenue-507987e5?mod=rss_Technology&utm_source=tldrai)

Perplexity will start paying publishers for news articles from a $42.5 million revenue pool. The money will be distributed when Perplexity's AI assistant or search engine uses a news article to fulfill a task or answer a search request. The payments come out of the subscription revenue generated by Perplexity's new news service, Comet Plus, which will roll out widely in the fall. Publishers will get 80% of Comet Plus revenue.

[### gpt-5-pro can prove new interesting mathematics (2 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1958198661139009862.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Sebastien Bubeck, an employee at OpenAI, claims that gpt-5-pro can prove new interesting mathematics. Bubeck took the first version of a paper on convex optimization with a clean open problem in it and asked gpt-5-pro to work on it. The model proved a better bound than what was in the paper. The proof is correct - the second version of the paper (already published) had already reached this conclusion.
