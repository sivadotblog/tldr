### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Gemini 3 Review (6 minute read)](https://shumer.dev/gemini3review?utm_source=tldrai)

Gemini 3 feels more consistent and has less 'spike' than previous models. It doesn't output 'AI slop' on creative writing tasks anymore. The model is fast, and it often outperforms GPT-5 Pro without the wait. The Antigravity IDE is powerful, but requires active supervision to catch errors.

[### AI in Practice Survey (3 minute read)](https://theoryvc.com/blog-posts/ai-in-practice-survey?utm_source=tldrai)

AI is moving fast - every week brings a new agent framework, evaluation suite, orchestration layer, or open-source model. The AI in Practice Survey looks at what teams are actually adopting in production and what problems nobody has solved yet. It maps where adoption is happening, where the gaps are, and how teams are hardening and scaling AI in practice. The results of the survey have been compiled into an interactive dataset.

[### Partnerships and hiring data show AI companies are expanding beyond Nvidia chips (6 minute read)](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/ai-companies-expand-beyond-nvidia/?utm_source=tldrai)

AI companies are diversifying beyond Nvidia chips due to lead times, costs, and concentration risks. The market is seeing signals of a multi-chip landscape, as software improves and adoption of non-Nvidia solutions increases, evidenced by hiring trends and strategic partnerships like OpenAI's alignment with AMD and Broadcom. This diversity is expected to reduce lead-time risk and improve key performance metrics for startups.

[### GPU depreciation could be the next big crisis coming for AI hyperscalers (2 minute read)](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/gpu-depreciation-could-be-the-next-big-crisis-coming-for-ai-hyperscalers-after-spending-billions-on-buildouts-next-gen-upgrades-may-amplify-cashflow-quirks?utm_source=tldrai)

Modern GPUs threaten to accelerate asset depreciation beyond what even some of the largest companies can handle. Analysts worry the rapid pace of AI processing power advances could overwhelm companies riding the AI train. New advances quickly make data centers running last-generation hardware decidedly unprofitable. Everyone is competing for a limited pool of hardware, and no one is buying older GPUs, making operations even harder to sustain. With spiking electricity costs, increasing pressure for eco-conscious data center design, and a lack of clear profitability for AI, it's a disaster waiting to happen.

Stack Overflow has revealed a new set of products aimed at positioning the company as a valuable part of the enterprise AI stack. The company is attempting to remake its classic problem-solving forum into a tool for translating human expertise into an AI-accessible format. Slack Internal is an enterprise version of the web forum that exports a layer of metadata alongside question and answer pairs. It includes a writing function that allows agents to create their own queries if they can't answer a question or notice a knowledge gap.
