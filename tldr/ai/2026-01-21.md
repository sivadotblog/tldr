[### Anthropic CEO: Selling H200s to China is like giving nukes to North Korea (4 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/anthropic_nvidia_china/?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has likened the decision to allow Nvidia to sell GPUs to Chinese companies to giving nuclear weapons to an adversary. The Trump administration announced just over a month ago that it would allow shipments of Nvidia H200 accelerators to Chinese customers as long as the US received 25% of the revenues. Chinese authorities have yet to allow local buyers to acquire the GPUs. Anthropic wants stricter controls on AI exports, saying access to the chips would put Chinese model developers in a better position to compete with the West.

[### AI Gains Starting to Show in the Real Economy (6 minute read)](https://weightythoughts.com/p/ai-gains-starting-to-show-in-the?utm_source=tldrai)

The introduction of AI tools like Claude Cowork and Alibaba's Qwen Assistant marks a shift towards AI's real-world applications, similar to ChatGPT's accessibility impact. Recent data from Q3 2025 shows a 4.9% productivity jump, with minimal change in hours worked, indicating potential initial AI-driven efficiency gains. Despite early-stage adoption, these developments could significantly boost economic productivity and eventually increase living standards.
