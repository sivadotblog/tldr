### Research & Innovation

[### DarkBERT: Unveiling the Dark Web with a Specialized AI (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08596?utm_source=tldrai)

DarkBERT is a new AI that's been trained specifically on the unique language used in the Dark Web, which is different from what you'd find on the regular internet. By comparing it to other AIs and looking at various use cases, we've found that DarkBERT is better at understanding and working with Dark Web text, making it a useful tool for future research in this area.

[### Symbol Tuning: Enhancing AI Learning with Symbolic Labels (21 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08298?utm_source=tldrai)

Symbol tuning is a new way to train AIs, where we replace normal language labels (like "positive" or "negative") with random symbols (like "foo" or "bar"), forcing the AI to learn from the connections between inputs and labels. This method improves the AI's performance on new tasks, helps it understand instructions better, and makes it more skilled at logical reasoning tasks, with significant improvements seen across different benchmarks.

[### Boundless DAS: Understanding the Mysteries of Large AI Models (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08809?utm_source=tldrai)

Boundless DAS is a new method we've developed to better understand how large AI models, like Alpaca, work on the inside, by looking for understandable patterns in their behavior. We've found that Alpaca solves a simple number problem by using two understandable variables in a consistent way, no matter what the inputs or instructions are, which is an important step towards understanding how these complex AI models really work.
