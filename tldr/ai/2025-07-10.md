[### Perplexity's Comet: A Research-Oriented Browser (2 minute read)](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-comet?utm_source=tldrai)

Perplexity has launched Comet, a browser built to serve as an AI-powered assistant across both work and personal tasks. It integrates Perplexity's search and reasoning engine to help users organize knowledge, ask questions, and streamline digital workflows.

[### xAI gave us early access to Grok 4 - and the results are in (4 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1943166841150644622.html?utm_source=tldrai)

Benchmark tests on Grok 4 (in early access) show that it will be the lead AI frontier, beating out OpenAI's o3, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude 4 Opus, and DeepSeek R1. This will be the first time xAI has the lead AI frontier. The reasoning model is priced at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, which is identical to Claude 4 Sonnet but more expensive than Gemini 2.5 Pro. This post shows benchmarking results for the upcoming model.

[### OpenAI to release web browser in challenge to Google Chrome (4 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openai-release-web-browser-challenge-google-chrome-2025-07-09/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI plans to launch an AI-powered web browser soon, challenging Google's Chrome. The new browser will integrate AI agents for tasks like booking reservations, potentially disrupting Google's ad-revenue model dependent on Chrome's user data. OpenAI's browser, built on Google's open-source Chromium, reflects its strategy to directly capture user web behavior data.

Biomni is a general-purpose biomedical AI agent that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code execution to autonomously complete research tasks across biomedical domains.

[### Cats Confuse Reasoning LLM: Query Agnostic Adversarial Triggers for Reasoning Models (20 minute read)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01781?utm_source=tldrai)

Adding irrelevant phrases like "Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives" to math problems causes reasoning models to generate incorrect answers 300% more often than baseline. The query-agnostic phenomenon transfers across model size, with distilled models showing even higher vulnerability rates. The attacks also cause significant computational overhead, with 42% of responses exceeding 1.5x normal token length.
