xAI has announced a $6 billion Series B funding round led by top investors to advance its AI systems, including the Grok-1 models with enhanced capabilities. The funding will fuel product go-to-market strategies, infrastructure, and R&D.

[### Some More Details Into Apple's AI Strategy (2 minute read)](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iphone-to-get-a-better-siri-ai-emoji-creator-smart-recaps-and-more-with-ios-18/articleshow/110452936.cms?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple's AI strategy is focused on practical AI features to improve its products, such as Project Greymatter, a set of AI tools that will be integrated into key Apple apps.

[### Mapping the Mind of a Large Language Model (8 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic researchers have unveiled a method to interpret the inner workings of its large language model, Claude Sonnet, by mapping out millions of features corresponding to a diverse array of concepts. This interpretability could lead to safer AI by allowing specific manipulations of these features to steer model behaviors. The study demonstrates a significant step in understanding and improving the safety mechanisms of AI language models.
