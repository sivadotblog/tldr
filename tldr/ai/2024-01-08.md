### Research & Innovation

[### Steering Llama 2 with contrastive activations (12 minute read)](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/v7f8ayBxLhmMFRzpa/steering-llama-2-with-contrastive-activation-additions?utm_source=tldrai)

There are lots of ways to align a language model, for example, SFT, LoRa, RLHF, DPO, Prompting, and Threatening. This work suggests using negative embeddings added to the bias terms to push model generations towards a desired outcome.

[### Tuning a model without losing information (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02415?utm_source=tldrai)

Great research that shows that adding new blocks to a language model and then tuning it on an additional task prevents losing knowledge. This is demonstrated in both code and language tasks.

[### Text-Driven Human Motion Synthesis with Cascaded Diffusion Models (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02142v1?utm_source=tldrai)

A framework called GUESS has been introduced for creating human motion from text. It simplifies complex human poses into more abstract forms at various levels, making the synthesis of motion from text more concise and stable.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Edge Detection with Diffusion Models (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/guhuangai/diffusionedge?utm_source=tldrai)

DiffusionEdge is a novel edge detection model that outperforms existing methods. By integrating a diffusion probabilistic model, DiffusionEdge delivers more accurate and crisp edge maps while being resource-efficient.

[### Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Prompts (4 minute read)](https://muzairkhattak.github.io/ProText/?utm_source=tldrai)

This project introduces a method to adapt CLIP-like vision-language models for various tasks while retaining its generalization ability. The approach learns prompts from LLM data, avoiding the need for labeled images.

[### A Multi-modal Assistant Powered by Phi-2 Language Model (6 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02330v1?utm_source=tldrai)

LLaVA-Phi is an innovative multi-modal assistant that uses the Phi-2 language model. Despite its small size of 2.7B parameters, LLaVA-Phi excels in multi-modal dialogues, combining text and visuals.
