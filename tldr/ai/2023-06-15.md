### Headlines & Launches

[### Synthesia raises $90M Series C (4 minute read)](https://www.synthesia.io/post/series-c?utm_source=tldrai)

Synthesia announced a $90M Series C funding round led by Accel. The funds will boost their mission to make video creation easy for everyone, driving their AI research and enhancing their collaborative video editing platform with better avatar technology, real-time collaboration, and enhanced sharing functionality.

[### AMD reveals new AI chip to challenge Nvidia‚Äôs dominance (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/13/amd-reveals-new-ai-chip-to-challenge-nvidias-dominance.html?utm_source=tldrai)

AMD announced its latest AI-dedicated GPU, the MI300X, set to ship later this year. The chip poses a robust challenge to Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market. This launch aligns with AMD's strategic focus on AI, a sector forecasted to grow from $30 billion to over $150 billion by 2027. Designed for large language models, the MI300X, with its superior memory capacity and support for ROCm software, could drive down costs of AI applications and tap into Nvidia's market share.

[### Europeans Take A Major Step Toward Regulating AI (3 minute read)](https://archive.ph/XWQZJ?utm_source=tldrai)

The European Parliament has passed a draft law for regulating artificial intelligence (AI). The law restricts the use of AI in certain high-risk areas, such as in the legal system. It would also require companies to disclose more information about the data they use to create AI systems.

### Research & Innovation

[### SoViT: A More Efficient Vision Transformer (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13035?utm_source=tldrai)

This research presents SoViT, a vision transformer that has been optimized for size and shape using advanced scaling methods, resulting in performance competitive with much larger models, but with less computation. Through tests across various tasks like image classification, captioning, visual question answering, and zero-shot transfer, SoViT demonstrates its effectiveness, indicating a new direction for optimizing, rather than simply scaling up vision models.

[### A More Effective RGB-D Object Detector (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03630v1?utm_source=tldrai)

In this research, the authors created a better way to detect objects in combined color-depth (RGB-D) images using a new training method that requires less supervision and separates different kinds of data effectively.

[### Improving Anomaly Detection (18 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07114v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTAD) is important for many real-world applications like smart surveillance and risk management. In this study, the authors create a new system called Coupled Attention-based Neural Network (CAN) to better detect these anomalies. It uses a special network that can adapt to changing data, making it more accurate in different scenarios.

### Engineering & Resources

[### A Toolkit for Comprehensive Event Extraction (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/thu-keg/omnievent?utm_source=tldrai)

OmniEvent is an open-source toolkit designed for event extraction, encompassing both event detection and argument extraction processes. The toolkit offers a comprehensive approach for various paradigms, providing fair and unified evaluations on commonly-used English and Chinese datasets. Its modular design ensures a high degree of extensibility.

[### Open code model beats ChatGPT at coding tasks (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/tree/main/WizardCoder?utm_source=tldrai)

Closed models are strong because they are actually code models disguised as language models. A lot of the open language models fall short because they don't gain reasoning skills from massive code pretraining. Here, we have Starcoder models instruction tuned on Evol instructions and achieving an astonishing 57 on the HumanEval Benchmarks. Models and code are available.

[### Audiocraft (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft?utm_source=tldrai)

Audiocraft is a PyTorch library for deep learning research on audio generation. At the moment, it contains the code for MusicGen, a state-of-the-art controllable text-to-music model.

Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal want to clarify that the internet's bedrock liability law does not apply to generative AI, per a new bill introduced Wednesday that was shared exclusively with Axios.

[### Microsoft‚Äôs Satya Nadella Is Betting Everything on AI (12 minute read)](https://archive.ph/WIHTZ?utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, has led the company to an impressive resurgence in AI tech by integrating OpenAI's language model into Bing via a chatbot named Sydney and launching Copilot, an AI tool that automates aspects of coding. Despite initial hiccups, Microsoft is becoming a heavyweight in the AI arena. The company sees its $10B investment in OpenAI as a key strategic move. Nadella views AI as an empowerment tool for humans and emphasizes the importance of aligning AI with core human values while continuing to explore its potential and manage unintended consequences.

[### Researchers Warn Of Model Collapse (4 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-ai-feedback-loop-researchers-warn-of-model-collapse-as-ai-trains-on-ai-generated-content/?utm_source=tldrai)

Researchers have warned that AI models that are trained on AI-generated content can collapse, meaning they forget the true underlying data distribution and produce erroneous responses. This can lead to problems such as discrimination and a distorted perception of reality.
