### Headlines & Launches

[### Apple intelligence and AI maximalism (6 minute read)](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/06/20/apple-intelligence?utm_source=tldrai)

Apple is segmenting its AI approach, differentiating between 'context' and 'world' models, with the latter, such as ChatGPT, being used for open-ended queries but without personal context. OpenAI's position is not highly defensible, given the lack of moats in large language models (LLMs) and the rise of competing models. Apple's strategy suggests a commoditization trend for LLMs that leverages on-device capabilities and private cloud to provide AI features while viewing services like ChatGPT as interchangeable components.

[### Etched raises $120m Series A to build AI chips for transformers (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/etched-is-building-an-ai-chip-that-only-runs-transformer-models/?utm_source=tldrai)

Etched has announced a $120M round led by Primary Venture Partners and Positive Sum Ventures, as well as angel investors including Peter Thiel, Stanley Druckenmiller, and David Siegel. It is working directly with TSMC's Emerging Business Group to produce chips on their state-of-the-art, 4 nanometer node. Its chips can achieve 500K tokens/second. One 8xSohu can replace 160 H100s.

[### Stability AI New Funding (2 minute read)](https://stability.ai/news/stability-ai-secures-significant-new-investment?utm_source=tldrai)
