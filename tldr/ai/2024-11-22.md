### Headlines & Launches

[### BFL launches Flux Tools (7 minute read)](https://blackforestlabs.ai/flux-1-tools/?utm_source=tldrai)

FLUX.1 Tools is a suite of models designed to add control and steerability to the text-to-image model FLUX.1. It contains a number of utilities and model checkpoints that allow for editability based on the FLUX models. It enables inpainting, outpainting, and some controlnets. The tools are useful for those looking to improve their creative suite on top of some of the best models out there.

[### ElevenLabs now offers ability to build conversational AI agents (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/elevenlabs-now-offers-ability-to-build-conversational-ai-agents/?utm_source=tldrai)

ElevenLabs has launched a platform for building customizable conversational AI bots. The platform allows users to adjust variables like tone and response length and integrate custom LLMs. The company aims to compete with OpenAI and others by offering flexible model and voice options.

[### Elon Musk Asked People to Upload Their Health Data. X Users Obliged (5 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/well/x-grok-health-privacy.html?unlocked_article_code=1.a04.k65h.c7aN7-TAu-PB&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrai)

Users are submitting medical images to X's AI chatbot Grok for diagnoses, a practice encouraged by Elon Musk despite concerns over accuracy and privacy. Unlike secure medical environments, Grok's interface lacks HIPAA protection, raising ethical issues about data usage. While AI's potential in healthcare is significant, experts warn of the dangers of inaccurate results and privacy breaches.

### Research & Innovation

[### Solving Cold Starts in Adaptive Testing (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12182v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The "cold start" problem in adaptive testing is where initial questions poorly match examinees' abilities. To combat this, researchers have developed the Diffusion Cognitive States Transfer Framework (DCSR), which uses diffusion models to leverage prior learning data across domains.

[### A statistical approach to model evaluations (21 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/statistical-approach-to-model-evals?utm_source=tldrai)

When two models are compared on a benchmark, and one of them is declared better than the other, it's hard to have much confidence in that declaration. This work from Anthropic explores some nice statistical methods that can be used to truly determine when one model outperforms.

[### T√ºlu 3: The next era in open post-training (18 minute read)](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/tulu-3?utm_source=tldrai)

Open source, frontier level, post training recipe with open data, training code, model weights, and scientific insights. Potentially the best source of knowledge on modern post training for large language models.

### Engineering & Resources

[### SAMURAI: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Zero-Shot Visual Tracking with Motion-Aware Memory (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/yangchris11/samurai?utm_source=tldrai)

Long tracking of a consistent object over time can be pretty challenging. This work builds on SAM 2 and improves it with motion aware memory banks that keep consistency over time and through occlusions. It is one of the better visual tracking systems built to date.

[### Combining Caption Generation and Compression (6 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13033v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Large multi-modal models can generate captions and compress images simultaneously within a single system.

[### Compress and Reconstruct Images (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/guaishou74851/pcnet?utm_source=tldrai)

PCNet is a new compact network for image-compressed sensing. It reduces sampling costs while delivering high-quality reconstructions.

### Miscellaneous

[### We can all be AI engineers ‚Äì and we can do it with open source models (3 minute read)](https://blog.helix.ml/p/we-can-all-be-ai-engineers?utm_source=tldrai)

Barriers to AI engineering are rapidly diminishing as tools enhance and workflow standardization simplifies complex processes. Building AI apps now requires using basic engineering knowledge to leverage models, prompts, integrations, tests, and deployment. Open source models preserve data privacy, while existing DevOps tools facilitate AI app development and management.

[### Software is a team sport (12 minute read)](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/software-is-a-team-sport-building-the-future-of-software-development-together/?utm_source=tldrai)

GitHub Copilot, adopted by over 2.8 million users, enhances developer experience with features like AI-powered code completion, debugging, and secure code reviews. Developers can choose AI models from providers like OpenAI and Google in Visual Studio Code. Integration with Azure and tools like GitHub Actions streamline cloud deployments and CI/CD processes.

[### Prompt Injecting Your Way To Shell: OpenAI's Containerized ChatGPT Environment (19 minute read)](https://0din.ai/blog/prompt-injecting-your-way-to-shell-openai-s-containerized-chatgpt-environment?utm_source=tldrai)

This article explores the interactive capabilities within OpenAI's Debian-based sandbox environment for ChatGPT, uncovering unexpected insights into its structure. Users can execute Python scripts, manipulate files, and potentially reveal core instructions via prompt engineering. This has provoked discussions on transparency and privacy. While these interactions are intentional features, OpenAI does not classify them as security vulnerabilities unless they lead to sandbox breaches.
