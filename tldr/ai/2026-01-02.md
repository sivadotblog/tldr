### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Nvidia, TSMC rise as the world's most valuable company reportedly asks for more chips to meet Chinese demand (2 minute read)](https://sherwood.news/markets/nvidia-tsmc-rise-as-the-worlds-most-valuable-company-reportedly-asks-for/?utm_source=tldrai)

Chinese companies have already placed orders for more than 2 million Nvidia Hopper-generation chips in 2026. Nvidia has roughly 700,000 units in its reserve inventory. The chips sell for around $27,000 each, amounting to more than $54 billion in revenue if all of the reported demand can be realized. Nvidia plans to start shipping the GPUs to China before the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts on February 17.

[### OpenAI's Audio Push (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/openai-bets-big-on-audio-as-silicon-valley-declares-war-on-screens/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI has reorganized internal teams to advance its audio AI models, with a goal of launching an audio-first personal device within a year. The effort aligns with a broader industry trend toward voice-first interfaces, as companies like Meta, Google, and Tesla integrate conversational audio into everyday devices.

### Engineering & Research

[### DeepCode: Open Agentic Coding (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepCode?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepCode is an open-source multi-agent system that converts research papers and natural language descriptions into code across three domains: algorithm implementation, frontend development, and server-side generation. The framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to orchestrate specialized agents handling document parsing, code planning, and implementation with built-in testing and documentation generation.

[### ByteDance's Robot Learns with Language and Video (7 minute read)](https://byte-dexter.github.io/gr-dexter/?utm_source=tldrai)

GR-Dexter is a full-stack framework for language-guided manipulation using a bimanual robot with high-DoF dexterous hands. It combines novel hardware, bimanual teleoperation for collecting demonstrations, and a hybrid training strategy that improves real-world robustness on both seen and unseen tasks.

[### mHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (1 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24880?utm_source=tldrai)

Hyper-Connections (HC) compromise the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) is a general framework designed to address this issue. mHC projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. It is effective for training at scale, and it offers tangible performance improvements and superior scalability.

[### How Webflow's CPO built an AI chief of staff (3 minute read)](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/this-week-on-how-i-ai-how-webflows?utm_source=tldrai)

Webflow's CPO, Rachel Wolan, developed an AI chief of staff to manage scheduling, meetings, and give candid feedback. Building her own AI software helped executives understand AI's potential, promoting organization-wide adoption through "builder days" and top-down mandates. Using markdown files for knowledge management and calendar delegation, her AI optimizes time management and workflow efficiency.

[### Where AI is headed in 2026 (18 minute read)](https://foundationcapital.com/where-ai-is-headed-in-2026/?utm_source=tldrai)

AI in 2026 will see startups advancing enterprise AI adoption, with specialized, on-prem solutions addressing privacy and efficiency needs. The landscape will also shift towards capturing decision-making processes as data moats, and AI security will become crucial as agents gain operational roles. SaaS incumbents will tighten control over data access, while AI's rising influence in e-commerce could disrupt traditional discovery and lead to new monetization models, notably affecting platforms like Google.
