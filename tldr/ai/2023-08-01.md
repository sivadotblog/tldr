### Headlines & Launches

[### Preparing for the era of 32K context (12 minute read)](https://together.ai/blog/llama-2-7b-32k?utm_source=tldrai)

Together AI has released LLaMA-2-7B-32K, an advanced model that uses Position Interpolation and system optimizations for enhanced long-context tasks such as multi-document understanding, summarization, and question answering. The model brings faster inference and fine-tuning speeds and comes with an updated software stack for efficient processing with 32K context. Users can try it at api.together.ai, OpenChatKit, or HuggingFace.

[### Dell is all in on generative AI (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23813929/dell-generative-ai-laptops-amazon?utm_source=tldrai)

Dell is venturing into generative AI with its new offering, Dell Generative AI Solutions, which features high-performance hardware and a managed services platform. Through a partnership with Nvidia, Dell aims to accelerate AI model execution and aid users in AI experimentation and troubleshooting.

[### Intel plans to build AI into every platform (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23810360/intel-pat-gelsinger-ai-every-platform-promise?utm_source=tldrai)

Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger, announced plans to integrate AI into all future Intel products during the company's Q2 2023 earnings call. Starting with the upcoming Meteor Lake chip, Intel's consumer-grade processors will feature built-in neural processing for machine learning tasks. Gelsinger emphasized the need for AI to operate locally, on the client side, rather than relying on cloud services, signaling a shift in Intel's strategic focus.

### Research & Innovation

[### Improving Transportation Safety with Large Language Models (20 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15311v1?utm_source=tldrai)

Despite the success of LLMs in numerous natural language processing tasks, they fall short in the transportation safety sector due to the need for specialized knowledge. This research addresses this by developing TrafficSafetyGPT, an LLM-based model fine-tuned using a unique dataset.

[### Balancing Multi-Task Learning with a New Algorithms (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15429v1?utm_source=tldrai)

In multi-task learning, the balance between tasks is crucial. This paper proposes two innovative improvable gap balancing algorithms that dynamically adjust task weights to improve performance.

[### When GPT-3.5 is cheaper than Llama 2 (8 minute read)](https://www.cursor.so/blog/llama-inference?utm_source=tldrai)

Training throughput, prompt processing throughput, and generating throughput all have different costs and are bottlenecked by different computational resources. Due to this, certain workloads are actually more expensive on Llama 70B than paying for GPT-3.5. This blog is elegantly written and has some really great engineering tidbits around model deployment considerations.
