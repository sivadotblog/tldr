[### Get the world's fastest Whisper inference with Baseten (Sponsor)](https://www.baseten.co/talk-to-us/?model=the%20world%27s%20fastest%20Whisper%20inference&amp;utm_source=newsletter_tldr_ai&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=2024_11_01_tldr_ai)

Baseten's model performance engineers have built the world's fastest inference engine for Whisper, the best open-source audio transcription (speech-to-text) AI model.

➡️ Over 400x real-time factor (1 hour transcribed in <9 seconds)

➡️ Best word error rate with domain-specific corrections

➡️ Lowest cost per hour for Whisper V3 (up to 80% cheaper than OpenAI)

This is the fastest, most accurate, least expensive Whisper inference on the market, counting custom hardware providers.
