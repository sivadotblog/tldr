OpenAI forecasts that it won't turn a profit until 2030, while Anthropic expects to break even for the first time in 2027. OpenAI is also expected to burn roughly 14 times as much cash as Anthropic before turning a profit. The two most valuable AI startups are taking vastly different approaches to growth. OpenAI is investing heavily in chips and data centers. Anthropic is taking a more cautious approach, making sure that costs grow more in line with revenue.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### AI Diffusion Report: Where AI Is Most Used, Developed, and Built (20 minute read)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/aiei/ai-diffusion/?utm_source=tldrai)

AI has reached 1.2 billion users in under three years, marking the fastest technology adoption in human history. However, the Global North's adoption rate is nearly double that of the Global South. The next 1–2 billion users may come easily, but adoption is expected to plateau afterward because the remaining ~4 billion people lack electricity or internet access. Low-resource languages create an additional barrier: half the web is in English, even though only 5% of people speak it natively.

Nvidia, currently valued at $4.5 trillion, is the most valuable company on Earth and the dominant supplier of AI chips. A pattern of fear around the company is impacting policy discussion. There are claims that the major AI companies disagree with Nvidia's policy stances, but are unwilling to speak out because Nvidia has the power to undermine their business. This article looks at the evidence of such claims.

[### Every AI application startup is likely to be crushed by rapid expansion of the foundational model providers (4 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1987787127204249824.html?utm_source=tldrai)

There is now almost no time to build a company and scale it. There are two ways an AI application founder can make money: make a flash-in-the-pan app that generates a ton of cash over a short period, or make a good enough app to get acquired by one of the big players. The situation is highly unstable. The best way to play is to find an application niche in a highly specialized field with extremely unique and specific data barriers.
