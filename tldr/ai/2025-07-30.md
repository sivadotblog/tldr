[### Why Your AI POCs Never Launch (Sponsor)](https://www.missioncloud.com/ai-readiness-assessment?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=tldr-ai&amp;utm_campaign=20250730)

Only 20% of AI projects see real business impact. What goes wrong with the other 80%?

After helping hundreds of companies deploy AI solutions on AWS, Mission identified exactly what separates the successful AI implementations from those that stall:

‚úîÔ∏è Organizational strategy

‚úîÔ∏è Data & technical infrastructure

‚úîÔ∏è Team skills

‚úîÔ∏è Clear use cases

[### The Making Of Dario Amodei (27 minute read)](https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/the-making-of-dario-amodei?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic's outspoken CEO attributes his passion for scientific progress to a personal tragedy: his father died from a rare illness just four years before researchers developed a cure that turned it from 50% fatal to 95% curable. That near-miss with scientific timing caused Amodei to abandon theoretical physics for biology and eventually turn his attention to AI, where he has played a key role in research responsible for AI's rapid acceleration.

[### Scamming Substack? (14 minute read)](https://willstorr.substack.com/p/scamming-substack?utm_source=tldrai)

Many viral Substack essays carry telltale signs of artificial authorship ‚Äî what one author calls the "Impersonal Universal" voice characterized by anonymous bylines, predictable anecdotes, and formulaic contrasts (‚ÄúIt's not X - it's Y!‚Äù). While human Substack authors bemoan the lackluster prose, the greater concern is not the artistic purity of the profession but the eyes and subscription revenues that might otherwise go to better, authentic writers.

ElevenLabs' new command-line interface tool allows developers to manage conversational AI agents as code. It enables version control, automation, and deployment consistency to voice and chat agent workflows. The tool has built-in support for multi-environment configurations, web hook and client-side tool integrations, and secure authentication. It includes a local scratchpad that enables coding agents to reason about and update AI agents programmatically. A video demonstrating the tool's features is available in the article.

[### In the field of cybersecurity, a distinction is made between the "blue team" task of building a secure system, and the "red team" task of locating vulnerabilities in such systems (4 minute read)](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/114915604830689046?utm_source=tldrai)

The blue team is necessary to create products, but the red team is just as essential due to the damage that can result from deploying insecure systems. The output of a blue team is only as strong as its weakest link - strong systems with weak components will be insecure while conveying a false sense of security. Contributions to red teams can often be additive - reports that contain both a serious and a more trivial vulnerability are more useful than reports that only contain a serious issue. AI may be better on the red team than the blue team - it may be better to get them to critique the work of human experts instead of directly replacing that output.
