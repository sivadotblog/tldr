### Headlines & Launches

[### Google Expands Voice Technology Support to 15 More African Languages (4 minute read)](https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-africa/africas-digital-decade/?utm_source=tldrai)

Google has introduced voice recognition for 15 additional African languages across its platforms, including Voice Search, Gboard talk-to-type, and Translate dictation. This update empowers approximately 300 million more Africans to interact with digital content in their native languages.

[### MIT's General-Purpose Robot Training (4 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2024/training-general-purpose-robots-faster-better-1028?utm_source=tldrai)

MIT researchers have introduced Heterogeneous Pretrained Transformers (HPT), a new model architecture inspired by large language models, to train versatile robots using data from various domains and modalities.

[### Cohere releases state-of-the-art multimodal AI search model (5 minute read)](http://cohere.com/blog/multimodal-embed-3?utm_source=tldrai)

Cohere announced that its Embed 3 AI model is now multimodal, enabling fast and accurate search across important enterprise image data sources like graphs, charts, product catalogs, and design files. With this upgrade, Embed 3 is the most generally capable multimodal embedding model on the market.

### Research & Innovation

[### View synthesis with minimal 3d inductive bias (3 minute read)](https://haian-jin.github.io/projects/LVSM/?utm_source=tldrai)

Novel view synthesis has long been thought to require strong 3D inductive biases. This work shows that with scale and some weak inductive bias, you can dramatically outperform previously thought limits.

[### Continuous Speech Synthesis using per-token Latent Diffusion (67 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16048?utm_source=tldrai)

Auto regressive models still dominate in many cases. However recent work on diffusion heads for images has inspired continuous AR diffusion. This work extends the per token diffusion idea to variable length outputs.

[### Change Detection in Remote Sensing (6 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16261v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces a change description instruction dataset to finetune LMMs for better remote sensing change detection.

### Engineering & Resources

[### Arcjet: protect your AI app from bots and abuse (Sponsor)](https://launch.arcjet.com/tvcL2X1?utm_source=tldrai)

AI costs money. Enforce user limits and prevent abusive bots using Arcjet security as code.

[### 3D Semantic Segmentation (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19446v1?utm_source=tldrai)

FtD++ is an approach for cross-modal learning that improves unsupervised domain adaptation for 3D semantic segmentation.

[### Scene Language for 3D scene generation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/zzyunzhi/scene-language?utm_source=tldrai)

Generating 3D scenes from scratch is challenging for a number of reasons, such as data constraints. This work introduces a programming-like language to describe 3D scenes and shows that Claude Sonnet can generate extremely compelling scenes despite not having been explicitly trained on this task.

[### Flux IC light (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/lllyasviel/IC-Light/discussions/98?utm_source=tldrai)

IC Light is the current best way to relate an image with a pretrained text-to-image backbone. This discussion is the beginning of extending that functionality to the strong Flux models.

### Miscellaneous

[### A Collection of Out-of-Distribution Graph Learning Approaches (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/kaize0409/awesome-graph-ood?utm_source=tldrai)

This repository lists papers on graph out-of-distribution learning, covering three primary scenarios: graph OOD generalization, training-time graph OOD adaptation, and test-time graph OOD adaptation.

[### Open source replication of crosscoder on Gemma 2B (6 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/srt6JXsRMtmqAJavD/open-source-replication-of-anthropic-s-crosscoder-paper-for?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic recently released two works that highlight its new interpretability method. This post is an open replication of the crosscoder on Gemma 2B.

[### Thinking Like an AI (13 minute read)](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/thinking-like-an-ai?utm_source=tldrai)

LLMs function as sophisticated autocomplete systems, predicting the next token based on training data and current input. Tiny changes in input affect predictions, leading to different outputs even for the same question. Understanding token prediction, training data context, and memory limitations can help refine AI use.
