[### A Banksy got everyday investors 32% returns? (Sponsor)](https://www.masterworks.com?utm_source=tldrai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=7-17-23&amp;utm_term=TLDR+AI+subscriber&amp;utm_content=none_banksy32_32return_pp_100_skip)

Mm-hmm, sure. So, what‚Äôs the catch?

We know it may sound too good to be true. But thousands of investors are already smiling all the way to the bank. All thanks to the fine-art investing platform Masterworks.

These results aren‚Äôt cherry-picking. This is the whole bushel. Masterworks has built a track record of 13 exits, realizing [net returns of +17.8%, +27.3%, +35.0%](https://www.masterworks.com?utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=7-17-23&utm_term=TLDR+AI+subscriber&utm_content=none_banksy32_32return_pp_100_skip) and more, even while financial markets plummeted.

Offerings can sell out in just minutes, but as a trusted partner, TLDR AI readers are invited to [skip the waitlist with this exclusive link](https://www.masterworks.com?utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=7-17-23&utm_term=TLDR+AI+subscriber&utm_content=none_banksy32_32return_pp_100_skip).

### Headlines & Launches

[### AP strikes news sharing deal with OpenAI (4 minute read)](https://www.axios.com/2023/07/13/ap-openai-news-sharing-tech-deal?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI and the news group AP agree on a technology sharing deal to help improve news quality.

[### Meta‚Äôs new text-to-image-to-text model (7 minute read)](https://ai.meta.com/blog/generative-ai-text-images-cm3leon/?utm_source=tldrai)

Decoder only Transformers (like the GPT series) operate by predicting one token at a time. If you treat interleaved text and images as tokens, you can generate images from text and text from images. This model can also generate hands.

[### The problem with LangChain (6 minute read)](https://minimaxir.com/2023/07/langchain-problem/?utm_source=tldrai)

LangChain is an extremely popular chaining and prompt templating library. It has gathered a strong community, especially with technologists coming into the field from other disciplines. However, it isn‚Äôt for everyone. This post explores some of the sharp edges.

### Research & Innovation

[### Provably faster convergence via long steps (23 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06324?utm_source=tldrai)

The rate of convergence for optimization methods is the mathematical limit for how quickly a model can figure out the best solution when guided by that optimization method. It turns out that cyclical learning rates can be improved with an occasionally huge step. Very compelling work.

[### Animate Your Custom Text-to-Image Creations (4 minute read)](https://animatediff.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

This report introduces a new system that can add life-like motion to any image you create using personalized text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion, DreamBooth, and LoRA. The system uses a 'motion module' which learns from real-life videos and can be added to any text-to-image model to produce personalized, diverse animations from static images, making your creations more lifelike and fun!

The language of the US Constitution is so ingrained in training datasets that it is classified as AI-generated. AI writing detectors are not reliable because they are trained on a dataset of human-written text. This can lead to false positives, which can have serious consequences for students and others who are accused of cheating.
