### Research & Innovation

[### ToolLlama (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16789?utm_source=tldrai)

Tool use is a paradigm where a language model produces words that trigger certain APIs to be called with the output being piped back in as tokens to the language model. This means that language models can use calculators, web browsers, and even coding environments. With the recent release of powerful open source language models, you can collect 40k+ viable APIs and fine-tune the model to use them. When you do this, you get a powerful Toolformer.

[### A Novel Distillation Technique (35 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16419v1?utm_source=tldrai)

This research proposes a new method that helps neural networks remember past lessons while learning new ones using a 'knowledge distillation' technique that models data in a way that considers its structure and helps prevent sudden forgetting of previous learnings.

[### Automatic Music Captioning (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16372?utm_source=tldrai)

Producing human-readable descriptions for music is challenging for most systems - it’s challenging enough for people! But with some clever data acquisition and labeling techniques, researchers were able to collect a dataset of 2.2m captions across a wide variety of music genres. They then trained a model on this dataset and got pretty phenomenal performance.
