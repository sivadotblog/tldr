In 2025, teams are rarely in the same physical space. Even with return-to-office mandates, work is distributed between physical locations (or ‚Äòoutsourced' to AI agents). Immediate, in-person interactions are the exception rather than the norm.

To adapt to modern work challenges without creating an alienated and atomized workforce, teams have to get better at asynchronous communication. Shifting to an [async collaboration model powered by Loom](https://www.atlassian.com/software/loom/resources/unleash-every-teams-potential?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paid-display&utm_campaign=P:loom*O:clm*C:gated-pdf*H:fy25q3*I:loom-ent-awareness*Y:loom*) can transform the way teams work every day.

### Headlines & Launches

[### OpenAI Introduces the Intelligence Age (7 minute read)](https://openai.com/global-affairs/introducing-the-intelligence-age/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI highlights the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the broader impact of AI, comparing it to past technological breakthroughs. Its Super Bowl ad positions AI as the next major tool in human progress, emphasizing its role in augmenting creativity rather than replacing human effort.

[### France's $112 Billion AI Investment (3 minute read)](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/macron-announces-112b-in-ai-investment-over-coming-years/3477218?utm_source=tldrai)

French President Macron announced a massive AI investment to boost innovation and international cooperation. He emphasized AI's role as an assistant rather than a job replacement, with particular focus on applications in healthcare.

[### Ilya Sutskever's startup in talks to fundraise at roughly $20B valuation (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/report-ilya-sutskevers-startup-in-talks-to-fundraise-at-roughly-20b-valuation/?utm_source=tldrai)

SSI nearly quadruples its valuation from the previous round of funding.

### Research & Innovation

[### Building Bridges between Regression, Clustering, and Classification (23 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02996?utm_source=tldrai)

This paper introduces a novel method for improving neural network training in regression tasks that involves framing them as classification problems using a learned target encoder-decoder pair. The approach outperforms traditional regression methods by leveraging the benefits of distributional target representation and smooth interpolation between different objectives.

[### Better GNN Generalization (19 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04891?utm_source=tldrai)

While maximizing spectral gap has been used to address over-squashing in GNNs, this paper shows that minimizing it can also improve generalization. The authors propose three new rewiring strategies to enhance label-community alignment, homophily, and computational efficiency.

[### Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning (34 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05171?utm_source=tldrai)

3.5B model trained to do latent reasoning which also shows dramatic improvement on math problems. The model itself is a recurrent architecture.

### Engineering & Resources

[### QuEST: Stable Training of LLMs with 1-Bit Weights and Activations (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/QuEST?utm_source=tldrai)

QuEST allows stable training with 1-bit weights and activations. QuEST achieves this by improving two key aspects of QAT methods: accurate and fast quantization of the (continuous) distributions of weights and activations via Hadamard normalization and MSE-optimal fitting, and a new trust gradient estimator based on the idea of explicitly minimizing the error between the noisy gradient computed over quantized states and the "true" (but unknown) full-precision gradient.

[### Diagen (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/southbridgeai/diagen?utm_source=tldrai)

Agentic workflow for generating diagrams with language models.

[### Better Programming Assistance (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/TechxGenus/CursorCore?utm_source=tldrai)

This work introduces a new conversational framework for programming assistance that integrates coding history, current code, and user instructions.

[### If You Think Anyone in the AI Industry Has Any Idea What They're Doing, It Appears That DeepSeek Just Accidentally Leaked Its Users' Chats (3 minute read)](https://futurism.com/the-byte/deepseak-leaks-user-chatlogs?utm_source=tldrai)

Wiz researchers discovered unencrypted sensitive data in DeepSeek's open-source AI model, exposing major security vulnerabilities. Despite difficulties in contacting DeepSeek, the databases were secured within an hour after the issue was reported. Wiz highlighted that such security oversights indicate the service is not mature enough to handle sensitive data.

[### Team Says They've Recreated DeepSeek's OpenAI Killer for Literally $30 (3 minute read)](https://futurism.com/researchers-deepseek-even-cheaper?utm_source=tldrai)

Jiayi Pan and his team at UC Berkeley recreated DeepSeek's R1-Zero model for just $30, showcasing a shift towards cost-efficient AI research. Their open-source model, "TinyZero," highlights potential challenges to big tech's expensive AI infrastructures. The development raises questions about the necessity of large-scale investments in AI.

[### OpenAI says its models are more persuasive than 82 percent of Reddit users (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/are-ais-getting-dangerously-good-at-persuasion-openai-says-not-yet/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI tested ChatGPT's persuasiveness against Reddit's ChangeMyView forum and found that its current AI models rank as more persuasive than humans in 82% of comparisons but still fall short of "superhuman" levels. The company warns of potential risks if AI achieves near-zero-cost human-level persuasive writing, as this could aid biased journalism and scams. OpenAI is implementing measures to monitor and mitigate AI-based persuasion, particularly regarding political influence and large-scale manipulation.
