It's unrealistic to completely avoid AI content in 2025. But without quality guardrails in place, it can end up surfacing irrelevant or poor quality results in site search ‚Äî and badly frustrating users.

This [Algolia white paper](https://www.algolia.com/resources/asset/ebook-evaluatinggenai?utm_campaign=tldr_global_wnet_ecomm_reach&utm_medium=display&utm_source=tldr&utm_content=tldr_global_wnet&utm_term=ebo-designing-gen-ai-systems&utm_camp_parent=b2x_ecomm&utm_2nd_camp=ecomm_tof&utm_region=global&utm_goal=reach&utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&utm_model=cpm&utm_marketing_tactic=reach) looks at practical ways to avoid this:

### Headlines & Launches

[### Microsoft, OpenAI Truce Clears Hurdle in Path to For-Profit Conversion (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-openai-announce-deal-to-extend-partnership-9273ec55?st=APySJH&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrai)

Microsoft and OpenAI will extend their partnership. The move could help OpenAI move towards becoming a for-profit corporation. OpenAI plans to create a new for-profit company in which Microsoft and OpenAI will each initially receive a roughly 30% stake. The rest will go to employees and investors. It plans to keep the nonprofit's control over the new for-profit and endow it with a stake valued at more than $100 billion.

Qwen3-Next is a new model architecture featuring a sparse Mixture-of-Experts design with hybrid attention and multi-token prediction. Its 80B-parameter base model activates only 3B parameters at inference, enabling 10x faster throughput for long-context tasks.

### Deep Dives & Analysis

[### Claude Memory: A Different Philosophy (6 minute read)](https://www.shloked.com/writing/claude-memory?utm_source=tldrai)

Claude starts conversations with a blank slate and only activates memory when users explicitly invoke it. It recalls by only referring to users' raw conversation history. ChatGPT's memory system exposes interaction metadata, recent conversation context, model set context, and user knowledge memories alongside the system prompt. That the two top assistants have built completely opposing memory systems shows that memory in AI has a massive design space with no right answer or one-size-fits-all technique.

[### Writing effective tools for agents ‚Äî with agents (15 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents?utm_source=tldrai)

Anthropic engineers found that agents perform better with fewer, more thoughtful tools rather than wrapping every API endpoint. Claude-optimized tools significantly outperformed human-written versions in internal tests, with agents able to automatically improve their own toolsets through evaluation loops.

[### Network and Storage Benchmarks for LLM Training on the Cloud (14 minute read)](https://maknee.github.io/blog/2025/Network-And-Storage-Training-Skypilot/?utm_source=tldrai)

Infrastructure choices matter a lot for distributed training. Network and storage configurations can easily create 6-7x performance differences. This post looks at network storage and configurations that directly impact both training time and costs.

[### Improving Cursor Tab With RL (6 minute read)](https://cursor.com/en/blog/tab-rl?utm_source=tldrai)

Cursor Tab is a system that predicts users' next actions across their codebase to make suggestions. The Tab model runs on every user action, handing over 400 million requests per day. This has given Cursor a lot of data about which suggestions users accept and reject. Cursor uses this data to improve Tab using online reinforcement learning. Its approach involves rolling out new models to users frequently throughout the day and using that data for training.

[### Tricks from OpenAI gpt-oss YOU ü´µ can use with transformers (23 minute read)](https://huggingface.co/blog/faster-transformers?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI's recently released GPT-OSS series of models features novel techniques like MXFP4 quantization, efficient kernels, a brand-new chat format, and more. The library has been upgraded considerably. This post looks at all of the upgrades in-depth. The updates make it very efficient to load, run, and fine-tune the models.

[### OpenAI growth rebounds following GPT-5 launch (4 minute read)](https://econlab.substack.com/p/openai-growth-rebounds-following?utm_source=tldrai)

GPT-5's launch was so botched that Sam Altman apologized for it. However, it appears business adoption has continued to increase after a slowdown earlier in the summer. It looks like GPT-5's release drove a sharp rebound for OpenAI's tools. Adoption growth is outpacing Anthropic for the first time since May.

[### Meta's Elite AI Unit Sparks Tension With Old Guard (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-superintelligence-hiring-tension-96c9e993?st=x4k7mV&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrai)

Meta's TBD Lab operates in a special badge-access area near Zuckerberg's desk, hidden from internal org charts. New hires routinely leverage competing offers from other frontier labs to secure massive compensation packages. ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao quit within a week of joining but returned after Meta tripled his pay and made him chief scientist. Meanwhile, existing employees lobby for raises while being excluded from the elite unit's secretive operations.
