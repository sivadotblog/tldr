### Headlines & Launches

[### Nvidia's new Titan GPU will beat the RTX 5090, according to leak (3 minute read)](https://www.pcgamesn.com/nvidia/blackwell-rtx-titan-rumor?utm_source=tldrai)

Rumors suggest NVIDIA may introduce a new TITAN AI graphics card based on the Blackwell GPU. Tech leakers hint at this top-tier card's existence, despite NVIDIA's previous decision to not release a Titan variant for the RTX 40 series. The release and actual utility of such a high-performance GPU, potentially 63% faster than the RTX 4090, remain uncertain. Market dominance by the RTX 4090 may make a new Titan superfluous.

[### Elon Musk Will ‚ÄòDiscuss' Tesla Investing $5B Into xAI (1 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2024/07/25/elon-musk-will-discuss-tesla-investing-5-billion-private-ai-company/?utm_source=tldrai)

Elon Musk says that he will ‚Äòdiscuss' with Tesla regarding investing $5 billion in xAI, his own private artificial intelligence company.

[### OpenAI training and inference costs could reach $7bn for 2024, AI startup set to lose $5bn (2 minute read)](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/openai-training-and-inference-costs-could-reach-7bn-for-2024-ai-startup-set-to-lose-5bn-report/?utm_source=tldrai)

OpenAI anticipated spending around $4 billion on Microsoft's Azure servers for ChatGPT inference in 2023, potentially causing significant financial losses. Although OpenAI is profiting approximately $2 billion annually from ChatGPT, it may require additional funding within a year to address a projected $5 billion shortfall. It currently utilizes the equivalent of 350,000 Nvidia A100 chip servers, mainly for ChatGPT, with discounted rates from Azure.
