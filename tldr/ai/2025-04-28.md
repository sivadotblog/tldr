[### Why Your GenAI Interface Might Need More Friction, Not Less (Sponsor)](https://resources.algolia.com/ai-search/ebook-designing-gen-ai-systems?utm_campaign=tldr_global_wnet_ecomm_reach&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_content=tldr_global_wnet&amp;utm_term=ebo-designing-gen-ai-systems&amp;utm_camp_parent=wnet&amp;utm_2nd_camp=ecomm&amp;utm_region=global&amp;utm_goal=reach&amp;utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&amp;utm_model=cpm&amp;utm_marketing_tactic=reach)

The standard UX playbook says, "reduce friction at all costs," but with genAI systems, this conventional wisdom might not always hold true. Strategic friction can actually prevent hallucinations and build user trust.

[Algolia's new developer guide](https://resources.algolia.com/ai-search/ebook-designing-gen-ai-systems?utm_campaign=tldr_global_wnet_ecomm_reach&utm_medium=display&utm_source=tldr&utm_content=tldr_global_wnet&utm_term=ebo-designing-gen-ai-systems&utm_camp_parent=wnet&utm_2nd_camp=ecomm&utm_region=global&utm_goal=reach&utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&utm_model=cpm&utm_marketing_tactic=reach) explores this counterintuitive principle along with practical implementation patterns for responsible genAI systems. The guide includes code snippets and system diagrams for [implementing explainable AI techniques](https://resources.algolia.com/ai-search/ebook-designing-gen-ai-systems?utm_campaign=tldr_global_wnet_ecomm_reach&utm_medium=display&utm_source=tldr&utm_content=tldr_global_wnet&utm_term=ebo-designing-gen-ai-systems&utm_camp_parent=wnet&utm_2nd_camp=ecomm&utm_region=global&utm_goal=reach&utm_creative_format=prmrynwsl&utm_model=cpm&utm_marketing_tactic=reach), multi-output generation, and content moderation pipelines.
