### Research & Innovation

[### Multi-Task Scene Understanding (16 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15101v1?utm_source=tldrai)

MTMamba++ is a new model architecture designed to enhance multi-task scene understanding. This approach uses a Mamba-based decoder featuring two core blocks, STM and CTM, to capture long-range dependencies and improve cross-task interactions.

[### The Mamba in the Llama: Distilling and Accelerating Hybrid Models (31 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs//2408.15237?utm_source=tldrai)

Mambda models are hard to accelerate with speculative decoding because of the lack of a KV cache for backtracking. This paper, from some of the original authors, showcases some novel acceleration algorithms and distillation methods.

[### Efficient LLM Scheduling by Learning to Rank (24 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15792?utm_source=tldrai)

When serving many concurrent requests to a large language model, things often get bottlenecked because we don't know how long output generation will be, so we get head of line bottlenecks. However, you can learn to rank relative lengths between requests and serve the shortest ones first, which leads to a 6.5x higher throughput for multi batch generation.
