[### Emergent correspondence in text to image models (25 minute read)](https://diffusionfeatures.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai)

Correspondences between images are semantic features in an image that mean the same thing. This could be noses on people, ears on animals, tires on cars etc. It turns out that text image models like Stable Diffusion can have emergent correspondence detection. Through a clever algorithm, you can extract these correspondences between various images. This is useful for stylistic transfer, and various other computer vision tasks.

[### CiT-Net: Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation with CNNs & Transformers (14 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03373v1?utm_source=tldrai)

The authors present CiT-Net, a new hybrid model combining CNNs and Vision Transformers, that offers superior performance in medical image segmentation while reducing computational needs and parameter count.

[### Questioning Supervised Knowledge Use in Novel Class Discovery (22 minute read)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03648v1?utm_source=tldrai)

In this paper, the authors explore if 'supervised' knowledge always aids in Novel Class Discovery (NCD). They introduce a new 'transfer flow' metric and find supervised knowledge can sometimes reduce NCD performance.

People are pirating OpenAI's GPT-4 language model by scraping API keys from developers who have used the model in their applications. Once they have the API keys, they can use them to run their own instances of GPT-4 without paying OpenAI. This is a problem for OpenAI because it means they are losing revenue, and it is also a problem for developers who have had their API keys stolen.
