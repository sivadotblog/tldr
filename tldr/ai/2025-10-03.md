[### Your AI code reviewer doesn't know what actually breaks. Sentry's does. (Sponsor)](https://sentry.io/product/ai-code-review/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=paid-community&amp;utm_campaign=aicodereview-fy26q3-aicodereviewlaunch&amp;utm_content=newsletter-ai-code-review-beta-learnmore)

Generic AI code review catches typos, style issues, and things that might be a problem. [Sentry's AI code review](https://sentry.io/product/ai-code-review/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=aicodereview-fy26q3-aicodereviewlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-ai-code-review-beta-learnmore) (now in beta) catches the bugs that actually take down production.

The difference? Context. Sentry already monitors your production errors and performance. Now it uses that data + your code and commit history to review your PRs - so it knows exactly which changes will cause issues based on what's broken before, in your actual environment.

Sentry can even [auto-generate unit tests for your PRs](https://sentry.io/product/ai-code-review/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=aicodereview-fy26q3-aicodereviewlaunch&utm_content=newsletter-ai-code-review-beta-learnmore#get-instant-pr-feedback). Because tested code breaks less!

[### Animals vs Ghosts (11 minute read)](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/animals-vs-ghosts/?utm_source=tldrai)

Today's frontier LLM research isn't about building animals, it's about summoning ghosts. Ghosts are a fundamentally different kind of point in the space of possible intelligences, thoroughly engineered by humanity. Over time, we may be able to fine-tune other ghosts more and more in the direction of animals, but it's also quite possible that they diverge even further and end up permanently different. They may end up un-animal-like, but still incredibly helpful and properly world-altering.

[### Claude Sonnet 4.5 knows when it's being tested (4 minute read)](https://www.transformernews.ai/p/claude-sonnet-4-5-evaluation-situational-awareness?utm_source=tldrai)

The model identifies evaluation scenarios 13% of the time and behaves unusually well afterward. Mechanistic interpretability showed internal representations of "fake or suspicious content" and "AI safety" concepts strengthened during training. When researchers suppressed these features, awareness dropped while misaligned behaviors increased.

[### AI as a research partner: Advancing theoretical computer science with AlphaEvolve (7 minute read)](https://research.google/blog/ai-as-a-research-partner-advancing-theoretical-computer-science-with-alphaevolve/?utm_source=tldrai)

DeepMind's AlphaEvolve uses LLMs to iteratively ‚Äúevolve‚Äù code that discovers mathematical structures proving new theorems in complexity theory. The system made breakthroughs on two mature problems by morphing finite proof structures while keeping the interface to the broader proof intact, allowing automated verification of correctness without human review.

[### Move Fast and Break Nothing (8 minute read)](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/10/is-waymo-safe/684432/?gift=TKR--SM2GlQT7eRMRoOSR9kFFhRa9lv4L7waRXqC_Lg&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share)

Waymo spent 16 years gathering data before going mainstream. Its robotaxis have driven 96 million miles with 91% fewer serious injury accidents than humans. It's a rare example of safety in AI and extreme caution in Silicon Valley: Tesla's Austin robotaxis crashed three times in 7,000 miles, and Cruise dragged a pedestrian 20 feet before GM killed the business. Waymo still limits rides to city zones despite years of successful tests on highways.
