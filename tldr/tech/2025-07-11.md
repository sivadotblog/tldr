[### Robot surgery on humans could be trialled within decade after success on pig organs (4 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jul/09/robot-surgery-on-humans-could-be-trialled-within-decade-after-success-on-pig-organs?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An AI-trained robot recently completed eight operations on pig organs with a 100% success rate. The robot, armed with tools to cut, clip, and grab soft tissue, successfully removed pig gall bladders without human help. They were trained on video footage of human medics conducting operations using organs taken from dead pigs. The success opens up the possibility of replicating, en masse, the skills of the best surgeons in the world.
