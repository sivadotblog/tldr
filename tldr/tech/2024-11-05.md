[### Apple launches new internal study focused on building smart glasses (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/04/apple-study-smart-glasses/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple has been conducting internal studies on building smart glasses. Apple often gathers secret groups when it has plans to launch a new category of product to collect feedback from. The company prefers to use employees for these studies in order to keep its plans secret. It will be years before Apple will have its smart glasses ready for consumers - until then, the company will be working on a cheaper version of the Apple Vision Pro and a second-generation device with a faster chip.

[### OpenAI's o1 model leaked on Friday and it is wild ‚Äî here's what happened (2 minute read)](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/chatgpt/openais-o1-model-leaked-on-friday-and-it-is-wild-heres-what-happened?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is set to unveil the full version of its o1 model sometime in the next few weeks. The model was briefly accessible by changing a parameter in the URL, but this has since been fixed. An OpenAI spokesperson said that OpenAI experienced some issues while it was preparing for limited external access to the o1 model. Examples of outputs from the model made while it was accessible are available in the article.

[### Plant-animal hybrid cells make solar-powered tissues, organs, or meat (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/biology/plant-animal-hybrid-cells-solar-powered/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists in Japan have created hybrid plant-animal cells - animal cells that can gain energy from sunlight like plants. The team inserted chloroplasts sourced from red algae into animal cells cultured from hamsters and found that the cells continued to perform photosynthetic functions for at least two days. The cells grew faster than usual when cultured alongside chloroplasts, suggesting that the chloroplasts were providing a new carbon source. The study's findings could have major benefits for lab-grown tissues, such as artificial organs, artificial meat, and skin sheets.

[### China reveals a new heavy lift rocket that is a clone of SpaceX's Starship (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/chinas-long-term-lunar-plans-now-depend-on-developing-its-own-starship/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China has been revising its Long March 9 rocket over the last decade in response to the development of reusable rockets by SpaceX. The design now looks almost exactly like SpaceX's Starship rocket. China intends to fly the vehicle for the first time in 2033. The Chinese space industry recognizes that the future of space flight is fully reusable, so it is re-calibrating its projects to align more with SpaceX's designs.

[### I've had a change of heart regarding employee metrics (4 minute read)](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/11/03/metrics/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The job of a manager is to know what their reports are up to and whether they're doing a good job or are generally effective. A manager that can't do that is themselves ineffective - which is the responsibility of their manager and so on up the line. Improving employee metrics tooling won't help managers do their jobs better if they aren't able to notice what is going on. Managers can end up relying on these tools too much instead of doing their jobs properly.

[### Regulators deliver successive blows to Amazon and Meta's nuclear power ambitions (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/regulators-deliver-successive-blows-to-amazon-and-metas-nuclear-power-ambitions/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon and Meta's plans for building data centers near nuclear power plants to fuel its electricity needs have run into regulatory roadblocks that have nothing to do with nuclear power itself. Meta's data center faces issues due to the sighting of a rare bee species on the land. Amazon's plans were blocked as it could cause other customers of the nearby nuclear power plant to suffer lower reliability and higher costs. Microsoft's plans to revive a reactor at Three Mile Island are still moving ahead.
