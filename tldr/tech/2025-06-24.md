Mark Zuckerberg has personally reached out to hundreds of researchers, scientists, infrastructure engineers, product stars, and entrepreneurs to try to get them to join a new Superintelligence lab. He is offering them hundreds of millions of dollars and in at least one case discussed buying a startup outright. Despite the financial incentives, some potential candidates have been hesitant to join Meta. It is unclear how successful Zuckerberg's efforts will ultimately be - OpenAI has given counteroffers to people Meta has tried to poach.

[### Court filings reveal OpenAI and io's early work on an AI device (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/court-filings-reveal-openai-and-ios-early-work-on-an-ai-device/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Legal filings submitted as part of a trademark dispute reveal details about OpenAI and io's efforts to build a mass-market AI hardware device. The companies have been vigorously researching in-ear hardware devices. However, io's chief hardware officer said in court that the prototype OpenAI CEO Sam Altman missioned in io's launch video was not an in-ear device nor a wearable device. The design of the prototype has not yet been finalized and the product is at least a year away from being advertised or offered for sale.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### A primer on the current state of longevity research (24 minute read)](https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/p/a-primer-on-the-current-state-of?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This post looks at the state of affairs in aging research. It offers some basic background knowledge for each topic covered. Longevity-focused research hasn't led to anything significant yet, but the field is still very young. Scientific discovery works in strange ways - research from longevity could end up impacting other fields, leading to unexpected returns.

[### New York to Build One of First U.S. Nuclear-Power Plants in Generation (7 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/new-york-to-build-one-of-first-u-s-nuclear-power-plants-in-generation-271cfd33?st=NN7q5k&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

New York plans to build a large nuclear power facility to add at least 1 gigawatt of energy, enough to power about a million homes. The New York Power Authority will find a site in upstate New York and determine the reactor's design. It may pursue the project alone or in partnership with private entities. The US nuclear industry has struggled for more than three decades to do much more than manage existing plants because of safety concerns, huge cost overruns, and a permitting process that moves at a glacial pace. This project could help jump-start a new era of US nuclear reactor construction.

Venture capital and zero-interest-rate policy supplied a ton of money to startups, allowing them to grow even if they were selling customers services at a loss. Today, investor money is going straight into subsidizing the costs of AI products. AI products will likely soon start showing ads to monetize. AI serves its users for now, but in the near future, AI will serve ads.
