[### Nvidia emails: Elon Musk diverting Tesla GPUs to his other companies (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/elon-musk-is-diverting-teslas-gpus-to-x-xai-nvidia-emails-say/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk redirected 12,000 H100 GPUs ordered by Tesla to X. He had told investors in April that Tesla had spent $1 billion on GPUs in the three months of the year. Tesla has been developing its own in-house supercomputer for AI, but Musk has previously said that it would be redundant if the company could source more H100s. X's order of 12,000 H100s will be redirected to Tesla.

[### It's not just you: Google seemingly scaled back AI Overviews after its rocky launch (3 minute read)](https://www.androidpolice.com/google-ai-overviews-scaled-back-rocky-launch/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google has scaled back AI Overviews. The AI-generated answers are now appearing in around 11 percent of queries, down from around 27 percent when the feature was launched last month. The company is still in the process of refining the feature. AI Overviews are appearing most in health-focused searches, despite the company highlighting the tool's use for shopping, restaurant recommendations, and travel in its marketing.

[### Flawed, scandalous trials tank FDA expert support for MDMA therapy (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/06/flawed-scandalous-trials-tank-fda-expert-support-for-mdma-therapy/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Advisors for the Food and Drug Administration have voted overwhelmingly against approving MDMA as part of a therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. While results from clinical trials showed positive results, a deeper look at the data uncovered a large number of trial flaws that threw the validity of the positive results into serious question. The FDA is conducting an investigation into accusations of possible data manipulation during the trials. There were claims that some of the trial participants were discouraged from reporting negative responses to the therapy.

A mRNA cancer vaccine for melanoma halves the risk of patients dying or the disease returning after three years. The vaccine is custom-built for each patient and specific to each patient's tumor. The average risk of recurrence for the type of advanced cancer the study focused on is 50%, but the vaccine brought the risk of recurrence down to 25%. The data from the study suggests that levels of cancer relapse did not increase in people with high-risk, advanced-stage melanoma.

[### Skip SDKs in Simple Integrations (4 minute read)](https://www.epicweb.dev/skip-sdks-in-simple-integrations?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SDKs are not always beneficial and can complicate the development process. They often organize API interactions differently to how developers want them, have hidden complexities, use outdated dependencies, and have learning overhead. Using direct API calls allows for offline development, custom typing information, and easier swapping of vendors. SDKs can still be useful for deep integration with a service, but for simple API integrations, they introduce too much unnecessary bloat and cognitive overhead.
