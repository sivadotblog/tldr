[### Figure AI's New Humanoid Robot Can Fold Your Clothes, Do the Dishes (3 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/figure-ais-new-humanoid-robot-can-fold-your-clothes-do-the-dishes?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Figure 03 is a general-purpose humanoid robot that can perform a wide range of chores at home. It uses an AI-powered system called Helix to see and execute complex actions without a predetermined script. At 5 feet and 6 inches tall, the 132-pound robot can run for five hours on a single charge. The company aims to release the robot in 2026, but acknowledges that the goal is a big push. A video from Figure AI introducing the robot is available in the article.

[### Intel Debuts New Technology in Make-or-Break Moment for CEO's Turnaround Bid (7 minute read)](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/COECWp&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Intel's Panther Lake processor designs are in full production and will go on sale in laptops early next year. The chips are made with 18A technology, the most advanced chip production technology developed and employed in the US. Intel needs to show that new products will win back lost market share and attract customers to its foundry position. The Panther Lake processor will more readily balance a PC's need to run demanding software without rapidly draining batteries.

[### A built-in ‚Äòoff switch' to stop persistent pain (4 minute read)](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/select-neurons-brainstem-may-hold-key-treating-chronic-pain?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have identified a key group of cells involved in regulating long-term pain states in the brainstem. These neurons are activated during enduring pain states and also integrate information about hunger, fear, and thirst, allowing for pain signals to be modulated by other brain circuits signaling more urgent needs. These circuits can reduce the activity of neurons that transmit the signal of pain. The research opens up a new path for the treatment of chronic pain.

[### China launches world's first dual-tower solar-thermal power plant in the Gobi Desert (4 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/energy/china-dual-tower-solar-plant?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China just launched a solar-thermal power plant that utilizes a dual-tower system to generate electricity in the Gobi Desert. The station features two 656-feet-high towers, each surrounded by a vast field of 27,000 mirrors. Known as heliostats, the mirrors concentrate sunlight onto the towers. The stored heat is used to generate steam, allowing the production of electricity well after sunset or during cloudy weather. The technology harnesses heat instead of sunlight, making it one of the few renewable technologies capable of providing stable, dispatchable energy on demand.

[### Bitter lessons building AI products (9 minute read)](https://hex.tech/blog/bitter-lessons-building-ai-in-hex-product-management/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

You shouldn't try to make AI work for your existing roadmap with fancy, clever engineering because much of it will be obsolete with the next major model upgrade. Instead, aim to understand model capabilities and how you can best pivot your roadmap accordingly. Companies need to learn to kill projects quicker if they need to hack together a solution to make up for intelligence. Just wait a few months and retry the idea when a new model drops.

[### Embracing the parallel coding agent lifestyle (7 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/5/parallel-coding-agents/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Coding agent software is still really new. Models have only really become good enough to drive them in the past few months. One of the ways to use this software is to run multiple coding agents at once, sometimes in the same repo and against multiple checkouts or git work trees. This approach increases the number of tasks that can be fired off in parallel without adding too much cognitive overhead. This post discusses patterns for applying parallel agents effectively.

[### Google struggles with remote work, drastically cutting ‚ÄòWork from Anywhere' policy (3 minute read)](https://www.neowin.net/news/google-struggles-with-remote-work-drastically-cutting-work-from-anywhere-policy/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A single Work from Anywhere (WFA) day logged by Google employees in a standard workweek will now count as a full WFA week, deducted from the yearly balance. Employees are allowed to work from a non-main office location for up to four weeks per calendar year. It is now best for employees to spend the whole week working remotely to make the most out of their WFA allowance. The WFA policy is designed for people taking trips - Google maintains a separate work-from-home policy that allows employees to work from home two days per week.

[### A Mystery CEO and Billions in Sales: Is China Buying Banned Nvidia Chips? (20 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/technology/nvidia-chips-china-megaspeed.html?unlocked_article_code=1.sU8.446U.23oBDjZiPiFW&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Singaporean firm Megaspeed is being scrutinized by US officials for its ties to China. US officials are investigating whether Megaspeed is helping China sidestep US export restrictions by diverting some of its Nvidia chips to China. Megaspeed has funneled most of its Nvidia chips to data centers in Malaysia and Indonesia to remotely serve customers in China, which is not illegal, but could be found unlawful if it is done on behalf of a Chinese company. Nvidia says there is no evidence that its chips have been smuggled into China and that Megaspeed is a company wholly owned and operated outside of China with no Chinese shareholders.
