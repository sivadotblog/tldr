[### Tesla is aiming for same-hour service with 'Formula 1 pit crew techniques' (3 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2022/07/23/tesla-same-hour-service-formula-1-pit-crew-techniques/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk says Tesla is working to achieve same-hour service on its vehicles using Formula 1 pit crew techniques. Tesla is aiming to make the majority of appointments same-day repairs. It will achieve that goal with bigger centers and more specialization, with each service center having service bays that perform very specific services.

[### Apple Watch Pro to feature a redesign and larger display, new sensors delayed (3 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2022/07/24/gurman-apple-watch-pro-redesign/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is set to unveil three new Apple Watches in two months. The new Apple Watch Pro will be a high-end model made for extreme sports. It will have a larger display, longer battery life, and a new body-temperature sensor. The rumored blood pressure and glucose sensors will not arrive until later this decade. The Apple Watch Series 8 will likely use the same chip as the Apple Watch Series 6.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Chinese Scientists Show Off Laser That Can Write Words in Mid-Air (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/the-byte/china-scientists-laser-write-air?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from China have developed a laser pen that can write in mid-air. The pen uses ultra-short laser pulses to strip the electrons from air particles and turn them into light-emitting plasma. Its power output can reach one million megawatts, but the device doesn't draw too much power as the bursts are so short. The technology could have applications in quantum computing, brain imaging, and other advanced tech such as holographic imaging.

[### Chemistry breakthrough offers unprecedented control over atomic bonds (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/science/chemistry-breakthrough-first-control-atomic-bonds-molecule/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An international team of scientists has developed a technology that can selectively rearrange atomic bonds within a single molecule. The method allows for an unprecedented level of control over chemical bonds and could open up many possibilities within the field of molecular machinery. It involves using the tip of a scanning probe microscope to apply different voltage pulses. The reactions are reversible, so the technique can switch molecules between different molecular structures in a controlled manner.

[### Blots on a field? (16 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease?fbclid=iwar3ioexblejigpys1a-gn6dtpmgbhpxf0vwnal4tng-hpawdus8ekj6ksbw?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A neuroscientist has discovered evidence that dozens of papers involving Alzheimer's research may have been fraudulent. He identified apparently altered or duplicated images in dozens of journal articles. Some of the research underpins key elements of the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's. These studies may have misdirected Alzheimer's research for 16 years. The finding implies that millions of federal dollars may have been misspent on Alzheimer's research and other efforts.

US security officials have identified a dramatic escalation of Chinese espionage on US soil over the past decade. Federal officials have investigated Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure, shut down a high-profile regional consulate, and stopped efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities. They have also discovered that Huawei devices atop cell towers near US military bases were capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications.
