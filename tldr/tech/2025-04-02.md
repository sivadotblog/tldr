[### The Pragmatic Open Source Contributor (23 minute read)](https://diurnal.st/2025/03/02/the-pragmatic-open-source-contributor.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

[### The case against conversational interfaces (12 minute read)](https://julian.digital/2025/03/27/the-case-against-conversational-interfaces/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Natural language is a slow method of data transfer and it isn't the best method to interact with computers. It takes much longer to say 'What's the weather like today?' than to simply tap on the weather app icon on a device. While the quality of large language model output is improving at an astonishing rate, the input modality is a step backwards from what we already have. We shouldn't have to describe a desired action using natural language when we could simply press a button or keyboard shortcut. The technology should instead complement existing methods, acting as an additional input mechanism that increases the bandwidth of data transfer to make human-computer interaction feel effortless.

Until recently, there were abundant jobs in tech. Today, an increasing number of people are stuck in job-search purgatory. AI is transforming the job market - some companies have publicly stated that they do not plan to hire engineers this year due to AI. Workers are being pushed harder to keep what they have. Students are advised to learn how to use AI tools and look for jobs at smaller companies - many tend to underestimate how applicable and transferable their skills are.

[### DeepMind is holding back release of AI research to give Google an edge (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/deepmind-is-holding-back-release-of-ai-research-to-give-google-an-edge/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

DeepMind has introduced a tougher vetting process and more bureaucracy to make it harder to publish studies about its work on AI. It has been most reluctant to share papers that reveal innovations that could be exploited by competitors or research that casts Google's Gemini model in a negative light. This is a significant shift for the company, which has long prided itself on its reputation for releasing groundbreaking papers. The company still publishes hundreds of papers each year and is among the largest contributors to major AI conferences.
