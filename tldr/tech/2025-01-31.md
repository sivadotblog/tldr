[### AI Coding Agents Delivering Industrial-Strength Impact for Engineering Teams (Sponsor)](https://sourcegraph.com/?&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter&amp;utm_campaign=primary)

Rather than trying to replace human judgment, [Sourcegraph's coding agents](https://sourcegraph.com/agents?&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_source=tldrnewsletter&utm_campaign=primary) let your teams define specific rules that align with your standards and processes.

Using a powerful combination of code search and AI, dev teams can precisely tune these rules and validate them against recent PRs, ensuring a high signal-to-noise ratio. Customers like Indeed are using agents in thousands of repos to increase code quality and reduce delays associated with code reviews.

See the impact for yourself ‚Äì start using [Sourcegraph today](https://sourcegraph.com/?&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_source=tldrnewsletter&utm_campaign=primary), and [join the Feb 6 livestream](https://streamyard.com/watch/Ddru6H2JRSWS) for early agent access and live demos of real productivity gains.

[### Google quietly announces its next flagship AI model (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/google-quietly-announces-its-next-flagship-ai-model/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google revealed its next-gen flagship AI model, Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental, in a changelog for its Gemini chatbot app. The model was available to Gemini Advanced users beginning Thursday, but Google has since removed the mention of the model from its changelog. The new model provides better factuality and stronger performance for coding and mathematics-related tasks. It is still in early preview and can display unexpected behaviors. The model doesn't have access to real-time information and isn't compatible with some of the app's features.

[### OpenAI in Talks for Huge Investment Round Valuing It Up to $300 Billion (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openaiin-talks-for-huge-investment-round-valuing-it-up-to-300-billion-2a2d4327?st=VTczth&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is in early talks to raise up to $40 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank. SoftBank, which will invest between $15 billion to $25 billion, is helping assemble investors for the rest of the round. The round would value OpenAI as high as $300 billion - the AI startup was last valued at $157 billion in October. The funding will be used to help OpenAI fulfill its roughly $18 billion commitment to the Stargate project, which will construct new data centers in the US to power OpenAI's technology.

[### FDA approves new class of painkiller ‚Äì the first in more than 20 years (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/medical/fda-new-class-analgesic-suzetrigine/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of a novel painkiller called suzetrigine for the treatment of short-term moderate-to-severe pain in adults. The new drug is the first of a new class of analgesics that aren't addictive. It selectively targets a sodium channel critical to pain signaling in the peripheral nervous system, inhibiting pain signals from being sent to the brain. The drug is not an opioid, which means that medical professionals now have an alternative to treating pain that doesn't require using a potentially addictive analgesic.

[### OpenAI partners with U.S. National Laboratories on scientific research, nuclear weapons security (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/30/openai-partners-with-us-national-laboratories-on-scientific-research.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US National Laboratories will be using OpenAI's AI models for scientific research and nuclear weapons security. Up to 15,000 scientists working at the National Laboratories will be able to access OpenAI's reasoning-focused o1 series. The new partnership will involve scientists using OpenAI's technology to enhance cybersecurity to protect the US power grid, identify new approaches to treating and preventing disease, deepen the understanding of fundamental mathematics and physics, and work on nuclear weapons. OpenAI will also work with Microsoft to deploy one of its models on a supercomputer at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
