[### Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger's Dream Job Takes a Nightmarish Turn (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/intel-ceo-pat-gelsingers-dream-job-takes-a-nightmarish-turn-97dd98e3?st=6uyez1upxysaclw&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Intel's stock ended Friday trading down 26 percent. The company recently reported financial results and an outlook with lower-than-expected revenue and profit-margin forecasts. It plans to lay off around 15,000 employees, target $10 billion in cost cuts next year, and suspend dividend payments in the fourth quarter. Intel's market value is now at a level last seen 15 years ago.

[### Nvidia reportedly delays its next AI chip due to a design flaw (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/3/24212518/nvidia-ai-chip-delay-blackwell-b200-microsoft-amazon-google-openai-meta-artificial-intelligence?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia's Blackwell B200 chips will take at least three months longer to produce than was planned. The delay is due to a design flaw that was discovered unusually late in the production process. Nvidia is now working through a fresh set of test runs and won't ship large numbers of the chips until the first quarter. Microsoft, Google, and Meta have already ordered tens of billions of dollars worth of the chips.

[### Neuralink installs its brain implant into a second human patient (3 minute read)](https://www.teslarati.com/neuralink-brain-implant-second-human-patient/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk announced on a recent podcast that Neuralink has installed its second implant into a human patient. The implant is apparently working very well. Musk said last month that there could be over 1,000 humans with Neuralink implants by 2026.

[### Consider the Eel (32 minute read)](https://www.generalist.com/briefing/consider-the-eel?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Forsea Foods is an Israeli startup focused on growing eel meat in the lab. The company believes that starting with a premium offering makes the most sense due to the high costs of production. The price of eel meat is set to rise as the global population is cratering - the European eel population has fallen by 98% since 1980. Forsea's technology allows it to grow different types of cells in a single bioreactor, cutting down on both production time and costs. It plans to launch its product commercially starting in Japan in 2026.

[### Mistral AI CEO Arthur Mensch on Microsoft, Regulation, and Europe's AI Ecosystem (13 minute read)](https://time.com/7007040/mistral-ai-ceo-arthur-mensch-interview/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mistral AI has rapidly risen as a homegrown European champion over the past year. The company was valued at more than $6 billion in June. Its CEO, Arthur Mensch, has been vocal in debates over the EU's AI law, saying that lawmakers should focus on regulating how others use those models rather than regulating general-purpose AI models like Mistral's. This article contains an interview with Mensch where he discusses attracting talent, how Mistral plans to turn a profit, and what's missing from Europe's AI ecosystem.

[### There's a Tool to Catch Students Cheating With ChatGPT. OpenAI Hasn't Released It (8 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-tool-chatgpt-cheating-writing-135b755a?st=e0lgjdvdxeu2qjb&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has a method that can reliably detect when someone has used ChatGPT to write an essay or research paper, but it hasn't released it despite it having been ready for release for about a year. The company is concerned that the tool would be unpopular with its users and disproportionately affect some groups. The tool is 99.9% effective when there is enough text. However, the watermarks it generates can be erased through simple techniques like having Google translate the text into another language and back or having ChatGPT add emojis to the text and then manually deleting them.
