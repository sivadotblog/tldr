[### Creating a sperm or egg from any cell? Reproduction revolution on the horizon (5 minute read)](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/27/1177191913/sperm-or-egg-in-lab-breakthrough-in-reproduction-designer-babies-ivg?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

In-vitro gametogenesis (IVG) involves making human eggs and sperm in the laboratory from any cell in a person's body. The process is already perfected in mice and researchers are on the way to making it work for humans. IVG would enable anyone to have children with their own DNA and could replace markets for sperm and eggs. There will need to be laws created to make sure that people can't become genetic parents without their knowledge or consent. The US FDA is already exploring the implications of the technology.
