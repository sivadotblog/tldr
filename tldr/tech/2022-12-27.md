Three years since its launch, Apple Arcade continues to add new games and spotlight small developers who might otherwise have gone unnoticed. Apple Arcade features a large catalog, special in-app events, and a microtransaction-free approach to mobile gaming. Arcade users can expect more improvements to the service in 2023, with another potential big platform refresh and more console-style, graphics-intensive games. This article contains excerpts from an interview with Matt Fischer, Apple's vice president of the App Store, where he talks about how Apple sees the competition for its store, what customers have been asking for, and how he finds new games.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### A startup says it‚Äôs begun releasing particles into the atmosphere, in an effort to tweak the climate (7 minute read)](https://archive.ph/PKGT7#selection-395.160-399.115?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A startup called Make Sunsets has launched weather balloons in Mexico that release sulfur particles into the stratosphere to reflect more sunlight back into space. While the technique could theoretically ease global warming, it also has unknown, potentially dangerous side effects. The company is already attempting to sell 'cooling credits' for future flights. Luke Iseman, CEO of Make Sunsets, acknowledges that the effort is in part designed to stir up controversy to drive public debate and push forward the field of geoengineering science.

[### Neuroscientists have created a mood decoder that can measure depression (8 minute read)](https://archive.ph/UPflZ?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have developed a mood decoder that can work out how someone is feeling by looking at brain activity. The device measures how severe a person's depression is to help doctors determine where to place electrodes for deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment. It has been used in several patients, but the scientists don't plan to carry out the procedure more widely as it is invasive, impractical, and expensive. The scientists hope to find trends within their small study in order to develop a generalizable treatment.

[### Experts debate the risks of made-to-order DNA (15 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/experts-debate-the-risks-of-made-to-order-dna/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There are dozens, maybe hundreds, of companies nowadays selling DNA at increasingly low prices. The genetic material necessary to begin constructing an influenza virus costs less than $1,500. New technologies promise to make synthetic DNA even more widely available. There has always been the risk that someone may use these services to cause harm. There are few regulations in the industry. While the US government has released guidelines to increase security, companies are free to ignore them.

[### What true thing do you believe that few people agree with you on? (Twitter Thread)](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1607472104727007232)

In this Twitter thread, Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) asks his followers what true things they believe in that few people agree with. Altman's response was that technological progress is the only thing that delivers real, sustainable economic growth and the absolute equivalence of Brahman and Atman. Other responses include the theory that we live in a simulation, that ideas and technologies take off based on how well they are distributed and communicated and not how good the idea or tech is, and that major platforms take user privacy more seriously than most people think.
