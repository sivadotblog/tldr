[### SpaceX conducts a mostly successful test of its Super Heavy booster (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/08/spacex-conducts-a-mostly-successful-test-of-its-super-heavy-booster/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX performed a static fire of a new Super Heavy booster on Sunday. The rocket survived the test and appeared to be in good shape afterward. However, the test did not run its full duration, and four of the rocket's 33 engines shut down prematurely. SpaceX is working on an upgraded version of its Raptor engines to address reliability. While it is unclear how far away SpaceX is from a second Starship launch attempt, the fact that the latest test took place on a Sunday indicates that there is some sense of urgency as the company can only close the road leading to its launch site on a few weekend days per year.

[### Google is offering an on-campus hotel ‚Äòspecial‚Äô to help lure workers back to the office (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/04/google-offers-on-campus-hotel-special-to-lure-workers-back-in.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google is offering its full-time employees the chance to book a room at an on-campus hotel in Mountain View for $99 a night as a 'Summer Special'. The offer will run until September 30. Google is hoping that the offer will make it easier for workers to transition to the hybrid workplace and lure workers back to the office. Some workers aren't convinced it's a good deal.

[### We‚Äôre closer to ‚Äòengineering‚Äô blood vessels (7 minute read)](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/we-re-closer-to-engineering-blood-vessels?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Bypass surgery has significant limitations. For example, some patients lack appropriate donor vessels. Tissue engineered blood vessels, blood vessels manufactured using human cells and tissue, could provide a viable treatment option. A team of researchers has developed a fast, inexpensive, and scalable method for tissue engineering blood vessels that replicate the complex geometry of native blood vessels. The technology is not yet ready for bypass surgery, but the team believes they are on the right track. This article explains the difficulties around creating engineered blood vessels and looks at how the researchers managed to do so.

[### Engineer Details Messy LK-99 Superconductor Creation Process (5 minute read)](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/engineer-details-messy-lk-99-superconductor-fabrication-process?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The process of making LK-99 is complex and there is some difficulty in sourcing some of the materials needed. The original papers were incredibly vague about the manufacturing process. They neglected to mention key details, so scientists trying to replicate their results had to guess. These factors have caused many failed attempts. The frenzy around LK-99 has dried up an unsuspecting worldwide supply chain. It is now relatively tough to secure red phosphorus, a controlled substance, and copper phosphate has climbed in price towards $20,000 per kilogram.

[### How room-temperature superconductors would change the world forever (7 minute read)](https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/how-room-temperature-superconductors-would-change-the-world-forever-dr-mohammad-yazdani-asrami-and-dr-devendra-kumar-namburi-4241558?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Room-temperature conductors would have a transformative effect across a wide range of fields, including computing, aviation, healthcare, and the fight against climate change. If the claims about LK-99 turn out to be repeatable, reproducible, and reliable, it will change the world forever. Many devices will become more compact, cooler, and energy efficient. The material could enable levitating devices, faster quantum computing systems, and particle accelerators that don't require vast amounts of cooling. Much more research is needed to assess LK-99's properties - promising claims about room-temperature superconductors have been published before, but they have either been retracted or their results have been unverifiable.

[### The Future of Remote Work (19 minute read)](https://staysaasy.com/management/2023/08/06/the-future-of-remote-work.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The debate about remote work is still nowhere near settled. This post discusses why it's hard to discuss remote work rationally, the positives and negatives of remote work, a framework for reasoning about remote vs in-office work, and why remote work is a strategic advantage to some companies and poison for others. The discussion of the future of remote work is complex, especially as both sides are incentivized to normalize their own point-of-view.
