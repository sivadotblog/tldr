[### SpaceX is hosting a new fellowship on space-based surgery. It could save lives (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/spacex-is-hosting-a-new-fellowship-on-space-based-surgery-it-could-save-lives?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX has partnered with the University of Arizona and Banner Health to host an Aerospace Surgery Fellowship. It will be the first-ever fellowship training program in the US that delves into the field of aerospace surgery. The program will train astronaut surgeons for future space programs. Graduates of the program will be eligible for board certification in aerospace medicine. Fellows have the opportunity to spend six months conducting research with SpaceX.

[### Record-breaking hydrogen electrolyzer claims 95% efficiency (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/energy/hysata-efficient-hydrogen-electrolysis/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Hysata, an Australian company, has developed new electrolyzer technology that promises to create competitively priced green hydrogen within just a few years. The cost of creating green hydrogen is one of the biggest barriers against using it as an energy source. By generating more hydrogen from the same sources, Hysata could drive the price of green hydrogen down to a point where it becomes competitive with dirty hydrogen and fossil fuels. Hysata's process is 98% efficient with extremely low gas crossover. The company plans to have its technology commercialized by 2025.

[### Examining AMC‚Äôs ‚Äòembarrassingly stupid‚Äô investment in a literal gold mine (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981454/amc-gold-mine-investment-memestock-adam-aron?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AMC announced this week that it is acquiring a 22% stake in a gold and silver mining company. The Hycroft mine reportedly contains around 15 million ounces of gold deposits and some 600 million ounces of silver deposits. Hycroft has been facing liquidity issues, resulting in reduced share prices. Analysts have criticized the move, as investing in an unrelated business that will not increase traffic to its main business when the company has outstanding debt could be seen as a misuse of shareholder capital.

[### Nvidia Unveils Big Accelerator Memory: Solid-State Storage for GPUs (3 minute read)](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-unveils-big-accelerator-memory-solid-state-storage-for-gpus?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia's Big Accelerator Memory (BaM) method can make GPUs seamlessly work with SSDs. BaM will be particularly useful for workloads that use large datasets. To process large datasets efficiently, GPUs either need vast amounts of expensive special-purpose memory or efficient access to solid-state storage. BaM will allow Nvidia GPUs to fetch large amounts of data from SSDs and use it independently from the CPU, making graphics cards more self-sufficient than they are today.
