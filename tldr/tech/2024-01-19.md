[### Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs new goal is creating artificial general intelligence (5 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24042354/mark-zuckerberg-meta-agi-reorg-interview?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mark Zuckerberg has announced plans to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). While he doesn't have a timeline for when AGI will be reached or an exact definition for it, he has moved Meta's AI research group FAIR to the same part of the company building generative AI products across its apps. The move aims to allow Meta's AI breakthroughs to more directly reach its users. Meta plans to own more than 340,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by the end of the year.

[### The next iOS update will make it harder to break into your iPhone (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24041535/ios-17-3-release-stolen-device-protection-apple-iphone?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's newest security feature, Stolen Device Protection, makes it far harder for thieves to hijack Apple IDs and any financial information stored on the device. It will require users to use Face ID or Touch ID and certain changes may take up to an hour to take effect. The feature addresses a key vulnerability where thieves can lock victims out of their Apple IDs by resetting the password using their passcodes. Stolen Device Protection will be included in the iOS 17.3 release expected next week.

[### Flying Kites Deliver Container-Size Power Generation (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/micro-wind-power-kitepower?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Airborne wind energy is a new field that uses kites instead of turbines to generate energy from wind. Kites are nimbler than turbines and can deliver a more constant energy supply. Netherlands-based company Kitepower has developed a system called Hawk that flies out in 'pumping' cycles - it flies out while pulling at a tether, generating electricity on the ground, and when the tether reaches its maximum length, the ground station winches the kite back in, using only a fraction of the energy it produced. The system fits into a standard shipping container and assembly at a new site takes less than 24 hours.

[### Figure's humanoid robots are about to enter the workforce at BMW (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/robotics/figure-bmw-humanoid/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Figure is sending its general-purpose humanoid robots to start real-world work at BMW's manufacturing plant in South Carolina. The deal may be one of the first-ever commercial deals involving humanoid robots. While the two companies have yet to announce exactly what Figure's robots will be doing on the factory floor, training has already begun in the company's labs for the first tasks. The partnership is milestone-based, so Figure will have to prove its robots can do useful work before it scales its operations.

[### What's new with ML in production (27 minute read)](https://vickiboykis.com/2024/01/15/whats-new-with-ml-in-production/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Most machine learning in production is still not related to large language models or generative AI, which make up less than 10% of the market at most. At their core, machine learning models are algorithms that perform compression on a corpus of data. A lot has changed in leading-edge machine learning applications over the past year as the industry has moved from smaller, business-specific models that perform specific tasks to very large generalist models that complete text. The pendulum is again shifting to smaller models that people are starting to fine-tune and run on their own. The industry still focuses on compression, but it is changing where and how much it is controlled.

[### Sam Altman Says AI Using Too Much Energy, Will Require Breakthrough Energy Source (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/sam-altman-energy-breakthrough?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It's no secret that AI models require astronomical amounts of electricity to run. Experts estimate that the industry could soon use as much electricity as an entire country. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is looking for cheaper energy alternatives. Future models will require even more power to the degree that they'll need a whole new power source. Altman has already invested around $375 million in a nuclear fusion company.

[### Coming to Grips With Apple‚Äôs Seemingly Unshakable Sense of Entitlement to Its Commissions From Third-Party iOS Apps (4 minute read)](https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/coming_to_grips_with_apples_seemingly_unshakable_sense_of_app_store_entitlement?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple has introduced a new tax on web purchases that prevents developers from offering digital items more cheaply on the web. Epic will contest this plan in District Court. Apple is demanding commission from web sales that occur within 7 days of a user tapping through to the web from its new External Purchase Links entitlement in an app - services that already sell over the web can continue to do so in exactly the same way. Some critics say Apple shouldn't and legally can't comply with its anti-steering injunction this way, but it looks like the company isn't doing anything contrary to the law.
