[### OpenAI Declares ‘Code Red' as Google Threatens AI Lead (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-altman-declares-code-red-to-improve-chatgpt-as-google-threatens-ai-lead-7faf5ea6?st=ET1JJ7&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared a 'code red' effort to improve the quality of ChatGPT. Other products will be delayed as a result. OpenAI is facing immense pressure from competitors, who have narrowed the gap in the AI race. Google Gemini last month surpassed OpenAI's models in industry benchmark tests. OpenAI is also facing pressure from Anthropic, which is becoming popular among business customers.

[### Anthropic reportedly preparing for one of the largest IPOs ever in race with OpenAI (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/03/anthropic-claude-reportedly-preparing-ipo-race-openai-chatgpt-ft-wilson-sonsini-goodrich-rosati.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthropic is in early talks to launch an IPO next year. It has engaged a law firm that previously worked on high-profile tech IPOs such as Google, LinkedIn, and Lyft. The company has also discussed a potential IPO with major investment banks, but the discussions are in an informal preliminary stage. The potential listing will test investors' appetite for loss-making AI startups amid growing fears of an AI bubble.

AI has changed the relationship between local tech scenes and San Francisco. The opportunity cost of being anywhere other than San Francisco is now at an all-time high. However, it is also much easier for players who want to stay local to start a one-person business and grow it themselves.
