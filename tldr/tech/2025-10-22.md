[### The Robots Fueling Amazon's Automation (7 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/amazon-robotics-automation.html?unlocked_article_code=1.vU8.gelF.WXcspolCQSGq&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon got started with robots in 2012 when it bought the robot maker Kiva, which made circular robots that could lift a stack of goods and take it to a worker. Since then, the company has categorized all of its operations into six types of automation: movement, manipulation, sorting, storage, identification, and packing. Amazon has developed robots that tackle particular changes like moving heavy carts, sorting packed orders, and manipulating items and packages. Employees only touch products at a few stages at Amazon's most advanced warehouse. This article takes a look at the state of Amazon's automation activities and what the future holds for the company and its technology.

[### Build Your Own Database (12 minute read)](https://www.nan.fyi/database?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This post walks readers through how to build a key-value database from the ground up. Key-value databases work similarly to objects in JavaScript - you store values using a key and retrieve them later using that same key. The post covers everything required to build a Log-Structured Merge (LSM) Tree, a type of database used in the real world that works by combining an in-memory list with an on-disk file. LSM trees have proven to perform really well at scale - on Prime Day 2020, DynamoDB peaked at 80 million requests per second.

[### AI is Making Us Work More (5 minute read)](https://tawandamunongo.dev/posts/2025/10/ai-work-more?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The AI boom has revived a 996 culture (working from 9 AM to 9 PM, six days a week). The increase in work may be due to hyper-capable tools creating a new kind of pressure to keep working. The challenge of the AI era is learning to live with these tools in a healthy way that doesn't allow them to enslave us, and knowing when and how to use them in a way that doesn't diminish our efforts. AI doesn't demand work - people and systems do.
