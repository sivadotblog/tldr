[### Swarmia wants you to stop measuring toxic engineering metrics (Sponsor)](https://swarmia.co/3awcctw)

There are useful engineering metrics like DORA and SPACE. There are also vanity metrics that do more harm than good, like lines of code written. Which are you measuring?

[Swarmia](https://swarmia.co/3AwCCTw) is a SaaS tool for tracking only what matters to engineering teams: cycle time, deployment frequency, batch size, and other [highly relevant metrics](https://swarmia.co/3AwCCTw).

Swarmia is free for small teams, available on the GitHub marketplace, and connects to Jira/Linear, Slack, or wherever your dev data lives. [Install Swarmia for free](https://swarmia.co/3AwCCTw).
