Tesla aims to start producing Optimus this year. The company plans to produce enough parts to make 10,000 to 12,000 Optimus robots this year and 50,000 units next year. The product is totally new, so Tesla's measure of success is to produce at least 5,000 robots.

[### Apple Wants to Turn its Watches Into Wearable AI (2 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/apple-wants-to-turn-its-watches-into-wearable-ai-2000579583?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple plans to turn the Apple Watch into an AI-infused wearable. It is working on a version of the smartwatch equipped with cameras, which will allow the device to do things like identify objects or translate text in a picture. Apple has had issues with implementing AI features and its past attempts at expanding the functionality of the Apple Watch have not gone well. The company is reportedly close to ditching a plastic version of the Apple Watch SE that was supposed to help bring the price of the device down.

[### 1X will test humanoid robots in ‚Äòa few hundred' homes in 2025 (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/1x-will-test-humanoid-robots-in-a-few-hundred-homes-in-2025/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

1X plans to start early tests of its Neo Gamma humanoid robot in up to a few thousand homes by the end of 2025. The company will be initially relying on teleoperators - customers will be able to decide when a 1X employee can view Neo Gamma's surroundings. The in-home tests will allow the company to collect data on how the robot operates to create a dataset for training AI models and upgrading the robot's capabilities. A video of the robot vacuuming carpet during a demo at a show is available in the article.

[### Post 50: Good Research Takes are Not Sufficient for Good Strategic Takes (4 minute read)](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/50-strategic-takes?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Having a good research track record is evidence of good big-picture takes about AGI, but it's weak evidence. Strategic thinking requires different skills - people often conflate these skills, leading to excessive deference to researchers without evidence of whether that person is good at strategic thinking specifically. Having good strategic takes is important and researchers should spend a fair amount of time developing the skill. People should be skeptical about people's strategic takes until they have proven they have the skill to make good strategic takes.

[### Revenge of the junior developer (32 minute read)](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There will still be plenty of jobs in the software industry in the future - just not the kind that involves writing code by hand. The world is changing, so junior developers are adapting. Junior developers have been far more eager to adopt AI than senior developers. Developers who don't adopt the new technology have lost.

[### The struggle that made us in Waterloo (4 minute read)](https://intention.bearblog.dev/the-struggle-that-made-us-in-waterloo/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The power in the software industry is transferring from the employee to the employer, causing many seasoned professionals to question their self-worth and students to worry. Being a student back amid the global financial crisis was a stressful experience, with the pressures causing many students to drop out every year. It didn't get easier for students - they just got better at playing the game. Current students need to stay strong and keep going. School can be challenging - the experience will change you in ways you won't understand until much later, but when you finally do, you'll look back and know it was worth it.

While Mark Zuckerberg claims that selling access to Meta's Llama AI models isn't in Meta's business model, the company does at least make some money from the models through revenue-sharing agreements. A court filing has revealed that Meta shares a percentage of the revenue that companies hosting its Llama models generate from users. These companies may include AWS, Nvidia, Databricks, Groq, Dell, Azure, Google Cloud, and Snowflake.
