[### SpaceX's Starship took a beating, but held on for first return from space (9 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/spacexs-starship-took-a-beating-but-held-on-for-first-return-from-space/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX's Starship launched successfully and made a controlled splashdown for the first time on Thursday. The test fell short of total perfection, but it was still a large success. Two of the 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster failed and there was damage to the ship's thermal protection tiles and one of its control flaps. SpaceX has already test-fired the ship for the next test flight, and the booster could be hot-fired soon. The next test flight, which could happen within a couple of months, may involve an onshore landing.

[### Netflix's latest redesign aims to simplify your homepage (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172351/netflix-redesign-homepage-experience-test?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Netflix is testing a homepage redesign on its TV app that replaces the static tiles with boxes that extend when they're selected. It is also removing the menu that pops out from the left side of its homepage and replacing it with a more streamlined selection of options at the top of the screen. The new homepage will be tested among a small group of users to start and expanded to more members if it goes well.

Researchers have created an ultra-thin battery about 0.2 millimeters thick. Powered by a biocompatible saline solution, the battery is thin enough to fit inside a 0.5-millimeter contact lens. The battery can use the glucose in tears to power up. Its capacity and voltage are currently very low and insufficient for powering data storage or an internet connection.

Researchers have discovered a new hibernation factor called Balon. The protein is very common, being present in 20% of all cataloged bacterial genomes. Balon inserts itself into every ribosome in a cell, interrupting even active ribosomes in the middle of their work. Its mechanism is a reversible process. Unlike other hibernation factors, Balon can be inserted to stall growth and then quickly ejected.
