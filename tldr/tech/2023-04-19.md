[### Microsoft reportedly working on its own AI chips that may rival Nvidia‚Äôs (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23687912/microsoft-athena-ai-chips-nvidia?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft is reportedly working on AI chips for training large language models. The chips have been in development in secret since 2019. They are currently being tested with large language models like GPT-4. Chips made by Nvidia are in high demand. Nvidia's latest H100 GPUs are selling for more than $40,000 on eBay. Microsoft plans to make its chips available within its company and OpenAI as early as next year.

[### The fascinating and evolving story of bacteria and cancer (4 minute read)](https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-fascinating-and-evolving-story?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Bacteria can be found within cancer cells. Cells infected with bacteria have increased expression of pathways known to enhance cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Scientists are able to manipulate the genomes of bacteria to make antigens that elicit potent T-cell responses against some cancers. These two findings show contrasting ways bacteria can influence cancers. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind these interactions could lead to improvements in therapy.

[### Demystifying LLMs with Amazon distinguished scientists (11 minute read)](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/04/demystifying-large-language-models-with-amazon-distinguished-scientists.html?utm_campaign=inbound&amp;utm_source=rss?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article features a transcript from an interview with two distinguished scientists from Amazon, Sudipta Sengupta and Dan Roth, about machine learning technologies. During the conversation, the pair helped to demystify everything from word representations to specialized computation on custom silicon. Transformers, the neural network architectures that have led to the rise of large language models, have grown more than 1000 times in size since 2019. The interview covers how transformers impact computing and energy consumption, their limitations, and how to turn these limitations into opportunities.

[### An example of LLM prompting for programming (12 minute read)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2023-chatgpt-xu-hao.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article gives examples of how to use ChatGPT to produce useful self-tested code. The prompt starts by setting the context for the application and how the code should be structured. Most of the prompt is setting out the design guidelines the code should follow. The prompt ensures that ChatGPT generates useful information about the problem first before it generates any code. Using this structure, ChatGPT can be more informed of its task and generate better responses.

[### Software firms across US facing massive tax bills that threaten tech startup world survival (9 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/software-firms-face-huge-tax-bills-that-threaten-tech-startup-survival.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many companies are experiencing an existential threat this tax season due to a change in law related to research and development costs. Lawmakers were unable to extend a key tax provision that allows for full expensing of research and development costs. Software development businesses are now facing massive tax bills that could force them into painful financial decisions. While many firms will likely make it through this year, their time could be limited if R&D full expensing treatment is not brought back.

[### Coinbase Could Move Away From U.S. if No Regulatory Clarity: CEO Brian Armstrong (3 minute read)](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/18/coinbase-could-move-away-from-us-if-no-regulatory-clarity-ceo-brian-armstrong/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Coinbase is considering moving away from the US if the regulatory environment for the industry doesn't become clearer. While the US may be an important market for crypto, the lack of regulatory clarity makes it hard for companies to operate in the country. The SEC and the CFTC have made contradictory statements, further complicating the issue. Coinbase received a Wells Notice from the SEC in March without receiving any feedback regarding the nature of its business.
