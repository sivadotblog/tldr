[### A New Antibiotic Can Kill Even Drug-Resistant Bacteria (4 minute read)](https://scitechdaily.com/a-new-antibiotic-can-kill-even-drug-resistant-bacteria/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new antibiotic developed using computational models of bacterial gene products appears to kill even antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The scientists developing the drug used algorithms to predict the structure of antibiotic-like compounds from genetic instructions within a DNA sequence. The resulting compound reliably killed Gram-positive bacteria in the lab, did not harm human cells, and successfully treated bacterial infections in mice. The study demonstrates a scalable method that researchers can use to develop new antibiotics.
