[### There‚Äôs New Proof Crispr Can Edit Genes Inside Human Bodies (5 minute read)](https://archive.ph/ER2WW?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Intellia Therapeutics last year demonstrated that in vivo Crispr treatments were possible for a disease called transthyretin amyloidosis. Last week the company revealed an in vivo Crispr treatment for another disease called hereditary angioedema. The diseases involve different genes, showing that the company can achieve exactly the same results in totally different genes. The results of the latest study have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Details about how Intellia's technology works are available in the article.

[### Do expensive Nvidia graphics cards foretell the death of Moore‚Äôs law? (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/do-expensive-nvidia-graphics-cards-foretell-the-death-of-moores-law/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang told the press during the launch of its new RTX 40-series graphics cards that Moore's law is dead. Moore's law states that the number of transistors per chip roughly doubles every 24 months. It is best understood as a law of economics and corporate motivation. While Nvidia may not be able to keep its processor power increases on trend at consistent prices, they are not the only competitor in the space.

[### Google and YouTube to take on Dolby with free HDR and audio standards (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-and-youtube-to-take-on-dolby-with-free-hdr-and-audio-standards/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google is looking to develop royalty-free alternatives to Dolby's HDR and 3D audio standards. Dolby's technology is deeply embedded in many products. Google's strategy involves standardizing a method of shipping audio and video data without paying Dolby and branding it well enough to compete. Google is one of the few companies with enough sway over the media space to push a new competing standard. Anything that Google wants to roll out will immediately have a sizable user base.
