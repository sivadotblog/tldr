### Big Tech & Startups

[### Why Google Thinks Its Pixel Phones Are Much Bigger Than Their Sales Numbers (12 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-08-21/google-pixel-10-future-of-pixel-google-glasses-interview-with-rick-osterloh?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTgzNjYxNiwiZXhwIjoxNzU2NDQxNDE2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNOMEpHUFdDSEMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.fhKp_d6Ea1ipU3wYZjQPQjSLVJRiQvC3cAw8e6IBBCY&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While Google's new Pixel lineup doesn't look too different from the previous generation, a lot has changed under the hood. The company now believes that real evolution will come from software and connected devices rather than hardware. It is already finalizing its 2026 phones and has begun work on its 2027 lineup. The Pixel's share remains small, accounting for roughly 3% of the market.

[### Oracle Rides Major Deals With OpenAI, Nvidia to Turn Around Cloud Business (14 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/oracle-cloud-powers-openai-nvidia-and-larry-ellison-s-riches?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTgzNTY1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2NDQwNDU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUFIOFFHUFFROU0wMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.HnKumLOS_espXBZxdCrQkrHG-kKlEE0GJdXpQV4K1sg&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is slated to become Oracle's largest customer, with the companies having struck deals for more than 5 gigawatts of computing power, an unprecedented sum. Another of Oracle's largest customers is Nvidia, which rents capacity from an Oracle cluster of H100 chips in Japan and from a data center being built in Indonesia. While Oracle's cloud business is still orders of magnitude smaller than Amazon's, there's plenty of room for growth. With all of its recent spending, Oracle recorded a negative annual cash flow for the first time since 1990. Questions about the longevity and margins of offering infrastructure to train AI models remain.

[### Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's rBio uses virtual cells to train AI, bypassing lab work (14 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/chan-zuckerberg-initiatives-rbio-uses-virtual-cells-to-train-ai-bypassing-lab-work/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, an organization established and owned by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, has launched rBio, an artificial intelligence model trained to reason about cellular biology using virtual simulations. The breakthrough has the potential to dramatically accelerate biomedical research and drug discovery. The model uses a novel approach called 'soft verification', which uses predictions from virtual cell models as training signals instead of relying solely on experimental data. The paradigm shift means researchers can test biological hypotheses computationally before committing time and resources to costly laboratory work.

[### SpaceX has built the machine to build the machine. But what about the machine? (18 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/spacex-has-built-the-machine-to-build-the-machine-but-what-about-the-machine/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX opened its massive Starfactory facility earlier this year. Measuring at about a million square feet, Starfactory is two times as large as SpaceX's main Falcon 9 factory in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX has now built the machine to build the machine, but its Starship rocket is still not yet ready for prime time. Starship's consecutive failures this year were a major setback for the program. The vehicle's tenth test flight is scheduled to take place no earlier than August 24.

[### What makes Claude Code so damn good (and how to recreate that magic in your agent)!? (16 minute read)](https://minusx.ai/blog/decoding-claude-code/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Claude Code seems less annoying to use compared to Cursor or GitHub Copilot agents, even with the same underlying models. This article looks at what makes it autonomous enough to do interesting things without inducing a jarring loss of control like some other tools, and walks through how to build delightful AI agents. It's important to keep things simple, as any complexity you introduce only makes debugging harder.

[### Dynamic Chrome Themes: Building DHH's Vision for Omarchy (7 minute read)](https://www.januschka.com/chromium-omarchy.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A change that adds the ability to change Chrome's theme colors dynamically from the command line is currently under review. If approved, it would give power users complete control over their environment through simple, scriptable interfaces and make the Classic theme as flexible as GTK/Qt integration. This post explains how the change was implemented and how it can be used to modify themes from the command line.

[### Elon Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to join xAI bid to buy OpenAI, filing shows (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/21/elon-musk-asked-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-to-join-xai-bid-to-buy-openai.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk asked Mark Zuckerberg to help him finance a $97.4 billion takeover of OpenAI earlier this year. Musk was incensed that the company was pushing to transform into a for-profit entity when he floated the proposal. Musk and xAI had approached Zuckerberg with a letter of intent, but neither Zuckerberg nor Meta signed it. The story was revealed in court filings in a legal case between Musk and OpenAI initiated last year to stop the startup from converting to a for-profit entity.

[### Class Dismissed (95 minute read)](https://joincolossus.com/article/joe-liemandt-class-dismissed/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Alpha School is a teacherless, homeworkless, K-12 private school in Austin, Texas. Its students have been testing in the top 0.1% nationally. They learn through self-directed coursework with AI tutoring apps for two hours a day, spending the other four hours of the school day in 'workshops' where they learn things like how to run an Airbnb or food truck, manage a brokerage account or Broadway production, or build a business or drone. Alpha School's new product, Timeback, is aimed at scaling Alpha School's concepts and results and giving students their childhoods back. Timeback will be free to everyone once it's released.
