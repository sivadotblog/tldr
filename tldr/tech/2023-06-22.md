[### How scientists are hacking the genetic code to give proteins new powers (17 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01980-4?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article looks at the current state of genetic research, the potential applications of the technology, and developing technologies. Scientists have encoded more than 200 non-standard amino acids into proteins and hacked the genetic codes of nematode worms, fruit flies, plants, and mice. Protein synthesis technology can be used to encode new amino acids to create new therapeutics. New bases and codons can be used to replace redundant genetic code, effectively rendering cells immune to foreign DNA. Further development in this field could result in the creation of synthetic protein-like polymers.
