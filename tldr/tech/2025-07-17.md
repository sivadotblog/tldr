[### Inside the Secret HQ of One of Neuralink's Biggest Competitors (22 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/articles/synchron-neuralink-competitor-brain-computer-interface-hq-tour?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Synchron's Stentrode brain-computer interface has been implanted in 10 people since 2019. The company differentiates itself with a minimally invasive implantation process: the Stentrode does not require drilling into the skull. It is instead inserted into a vein above the motor cortex, so it's near the brain but not directly on it. This article takes a look at the Stentrode and how it compares to Neuralink's N1 implant. It also looks at the wider industry and the state of other related technologies.

pgactive is a PostgreSQL replication extension for creating an active-active database. PostgreSQL added native support for logical replication in PostgreSQL 10 in 2017, but it still requires additional features to fully support an active-active replication topology. Its design makes it possible to build the necessary components for supporting active-active replication in an extension while the development community continues to add it into the upstream project.

[### Documenting what you're willing to support (and not) (4 minute read)](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2025/07/07/support/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sometimes, you just need to write down what you're willing to do and what you're not. This allows you to point to a document that sets expectations. There are issues that aren't worth supporting because it's a waste of time - having a document to refer to allows you to easily explain the reasons for refusing support without seeming rude.

Linux has finally crossed the 5% threshold in desktop market share within the US. The surge in use reflects broader dissatisfaction with dominant players like Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS. It is being driven by factors like privacy concerns, customization demands, and the rising cost of proprietary ecosystems. Advancements in user-friendly distributions such as Ubuntu and Fedora have lowered barriers for non-technical users.

[### Humans Are Sounding More Like ChatGPT, New Study Suggests (3 minute read)](https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/07/humans-talking-like-ai-chatgpt-study.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Humans are increasingly subtly mirroring AI language patterns by using 'GPT words' (common words used by ChatGPT, like 'delve' and 'underscore') in conversation. A new study suggests humans are starting to talk more like AI, a trend that started when ChatGPT came along a couple of years ago. The study tracked the frequency of GPT words in YouTube videos and podcast episodes from before and after ChatGPT's launch. Its results are a reminder that AI's influence extends beyond just tools and into the very fabric of how we communicate.
