### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Stanford engineers invent a solar panel that generates electricity at night (6 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/stanford-solar-panel-night?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Solar panels emit infrared radiation at night. The photons going out into the night sky cool down the solar cell. This temperature difference can be used to generate electricity using a device called a thermoelectric generator. While the method won't generate a huge amount of electricity, it still has many applications. Being able to generate small amounts of electricity at night could reduce the need for batteries and the costs they incur.

[### Oxford spinoff demonstrates world-first hypersonic "projectile fusion" (6 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/energy/first-light-nuclear-fusion-projectile/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

First Light Fusion is celebrating its first confirmed fusion reaction. The company's approach to fusion involves firing a projectile from a railgun at a falling target in a process designed to generate pressure levels high enough to create shockwaves that cause small deuterium fuel pellets to implode and start fusion reactions. The technique was inspired by the pistol shrimp, which can snap its claws so fast that the water around them is vaporized, creating shockwaves and bubble cavities that heat to tens of thousands of degrees. First Light is working towards creating a pilot plant in the 2030s. Many more details about the technology, including a video showing the reactor design, are available in the article.
