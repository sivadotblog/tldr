[### Apple Collaborating With LG to Develop iPads and MacBooks With Foldable OLED Displays and Ultra-Thin Cover Glass (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/01/foldable-oled-ipads-and-macbooks-in-development/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple and LG are collaborating to develop a foldable OLED display panel with ultra-thin cover glass for future iPad and MacBook models. LG has growing expertise in foldable OLED displays and sells them to other manufacturers such as HP and Lenovo. Apple's display could be around 20-inches in size. It may be creating a new product category for the device. The device won't be launched until after 2025.

[### Israeli bee tech startup Beewise pulls in $80m investment for robotic beehives (4 minute read)](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-bee-tech-startup-beewise-pulls-in-80m-investment-for-robotic-beehives/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Beewise is an Israeli startup that makes a robotic beehive that can monitor and care for honeybees around the clock. The Beehome uses robotics, artificial intelligence, imaging, a software platform, and a mobile app to look after up to 24 bee colonies at a time. It automatically controls climate and humidity and sends alerts when human intervention is required. The Beehome can even harvest the honey that its bees produce. Beewise recently announced a new version of its Beehome after raising $80 million in funding.

[### Some AI Systems May Be Impossible to Compute (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-neural-network?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There are fundamental theoretical limits to how stable and accurate AI systems can be. While there is mathematical proof that stable and accurate neural networks exist for a wide variety of problems, there may be no algorithms that can successfully compute them. There are limitations to what computers can achieve that can not be overcome with more data, computing power, or time. Knowledge about these limits could inspire more research. The limits imply the existence of a classification theory for describing neural networks that can be computed by algorithms.
