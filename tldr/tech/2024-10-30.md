[### Migrating RBAC to Fine Grained Authorization: Everything You Need to Know (Sponsor)](https://workos.com/blog/from-rbac-to-fine-grained-authorization-part-i-design-your-model?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=tldr-tech&amp;utm_campaign=20241030)

Role-based access control (RBAC) is showing its age. Complexity, role explosion, lack of flexibility, and poor UX are often impossible to work around.

Fine-grained authorization (FGA) solves all of these challenges. With WorkOS‚Äôs 2-part blog series, you‚Äôve got all the info you need to migrate your RBAC implementation to FGA:

### Big Tech & Startups

[### OpenAI will start using AMD chips and could make its own AI hardware in 2026 (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282843/openai-custom-hardware-amd-nvidia-ai-chips?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop custom silicon designed to handle large AI workloads for inference. It has secured manufacturing capacity with TSMC. The custom-designed hardware will likely not start production until 2026. OpenAI's chip development team reportedly includes lead engineers who have previously worked on Google's Tensor processors for AI.

[### Elon Musk's xAI in Talks to Raise Funding Valuing It at $40 Billion (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musks-xai-in-talks-to-raise-funding-valuing-it-at-40-billion-af808b9e?st=HzTTbb&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

xAI is in talks with investors regarding a funding round that would value it around $40 billion. The startup was last valued at $24 billion just a few months ago. The funding discussions are in the early stages, so terms are still subject to change and the talks could fall apart. The company's current revenue sources include the X Premium subscription and an API developers can use to build applications with Grok.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### The Battery Revolution Is Finally Here (12 minute read)](https://insideevs.com/features/738508/high-silicon-anode-solid-state/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Solid-state cells, an emerging, ground-breaking technology, are already hitting the market. These batteries solidify the traditionally liquid electrolyte, enabling advantages such as higher energy density and lower cost and weight. There are many different types of solid-state cells. This article looks at several of the competitors in this industry and their approaches to developing solid-state batteries.

[### ‚ÄúImpact printing‚Äù is a cement-free alternative to 3D-printed structures (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/impact-printing-is-a-cement-free-alternative-to-3d-printed-structures/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team of researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich claims to have developed a robotic construction method that is better than 3D printing. Impact printing uses Earth-based materials such as sand, silt, clay, and gravel to make homes. It is less carbon-intensive and much more sustainable and affordable than 3D printing. Earth-based materials are abundant, recyclable, available at low costs, and can even be excavated at the construction site. The researchers plan to commercialize this technology once they have a prefabrication facility.

Google's third quarter 2024 earnings call highlighted how important AI is to the company. More than a quarter of all new code at Google is generated by AI, then reviewed and accepted by engineers. The company reported $88.3 billion in revenue for the quarter. While many people feel Google isn't as reliable as it once was, the company continues to operate a very strong business. Google faces a potentially tough road ahead - a breakup is on the table following a ruling that the company is a monopolist in the search and advertising markets.

[### Inside Intel, CEO Pat Gelsinger fumbled the revival of an American icon (15 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/inside-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-fumbled-revival-an-american-icon-2024-10-29/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Pat Gelsinger took the reins as Intel CEO three years ago with hopes of reviving the American industrial icon. At the time, Intel had a deal going with Taiwan's TSMC where TSMC would make chips that Intel designed but could not produce at a deep discount. Gelsinger offended TSMC by calling out Taiwan's precarious relations with China, resulting in TSMC deciding to no longer honor the discount. Gelsinger's affront to Taiwan was part of a series of missteps, covered in this article, during his time as Intel CEO.
