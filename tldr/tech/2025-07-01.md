[### The second launch of New Glenn will aim for Mars (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/the-second-launch-of-new-glenn-will-aim-for-mars/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Blue Origin's second launch of New Glenn may carry NASA's ESCAPADE mission, which includes a pair of small spacecraft that will be sent to Mars to study its magnetosphere. The mission will launch no earlier than August 15, but some say that a launch in late October or November is more likely. The Mars mission was originally supposed to be on New Glenn's first flight in October 2024, but it was taken off the flight due to uncertainty about the launch date - the two spacecraft needed to be launched within a certain time period. With a launch this fall, the spacecraft should reach Mars in 2027.

[### Tail Latency Might Matter More Than You Think (3 minute read)](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2021/04/19/latency.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tail latency, or high-percentile latency, refers to high latencies that clients see fairly infrequently. Modern architectures tend to have a lot of components, so these rare instances of latency can still have a large impact. This article looks at the different ways tail latency can affect projects. Developers should be aware of service latency and consider monitoring common customer or client use cases for their end-to-end latency experience.

[### The New Skill in AI is Not Prompting, It's Context Engineering (5 minute read)](https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Context engineering is the art of providing all the context needed for a task to be plausibly solved by a large language model. Context is everything a model sees before it generates a response - this can include prompts, data in memory, retrieved information, available tools, and definitions for structured output. The secret to building truly effective AI agents is to provide quality context.

[### Apple Weighs Using Anthropic or OpenAI to Power Siri in Major Reversal (11 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/apple-weighs-replacing-siri-s-ai-llms-with-anthropic-claude-or-openai-chatgpt?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTM0MDk4MiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxOTQ1NzgyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWUhGRFpUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.pzyw7lQKovC43cazvJbkV70AMxtot2nnkb7A7yR6UCo&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is considering sidelining its own in-house models and using AI technology from Anthropic or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri. It has asked both companies to train versions of their models that could run on Apple's cloud infrastructure for testing. Switching to a third-party provider for Siri would be an acknowledgment that Apple is struggling to compete in generative AI. Apple's investigation into third-party models is at an early stage and the company hasn't made a final decision on using them.

OpenAI is shutting down for an entire week to force its staff to rest and recharge. The shutdown is being framed internally as a much-needed break. The company appears to be in 'panic mode' as Meta recently poached several high-value employees. Its decision to pause for a wellness week feels less like a perk and more like damage control.
