[### Chrome‚Äôs next weapon in the War on Ad Blockers: Slower extension updates (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/12/chromes-next-weapon-in-the-war-on-ad-blockers-slower-extension-updates/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Manifest V3 will delay extension developers' abilities to react quickly to changes by putting up roadblocks before extension updates on Chrome's extension platform. Ad blocking is a cat-and-mouse game of updates and counter-updates, and Google is forcing one side to slow down. With Manifest V3, all updates to extensions, including filtering lists, will need to happen through a full extension update on the Chrome Web Store, which means they will be subject to the Chrome Web Store reviews process. Once it becomes mandatory in June 2024, daily updates will no longer be an option.

[### World‚Äôs biggest experimental nuclear fusion reactor launched in Japan (2 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/01/worlds-biggest-experimental-nuclear-fusion-reactor-launched-in-japan?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The world's biggest operational experimental nuclear fusion reactor has been inaugurated in Japan. The JT-60SA reactor aims to investigate the feasibility of fusion as a safe, large-scale, and carbon-free source of net energy. The six-story-high machine is a joint project between the European Union and Japan. It is the result of a collaboration between more than 500 scientists and engineers and more than 70 companies throughout Europe and Japan.

[### Tiny robots made from human cells heal damaged tissue (3 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03777-x?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, have developed tiny robots called anthrobots made of human cells capable of repairing damaged neural tissue. The technique involves synthetically controlling a range of developmental processes and could be used in the future for personalized medicine. The scientists think that anthrobots made from a person's own tissue could be used to clear arteries, break up mucus, or deliver drugs with or without genetic engineering. Anthrobots could have applications in sustainable construction and outer-space exploration.
