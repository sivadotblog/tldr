[### Paralysed man stands again after receiving ‚Äòreprogrammed' stem cells (4 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00863-0?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at Keio University in Tokyo injected neural stem cells into four patients to treat spinal cord injuries - one patient, who was previously paralyzed, can now stand on his own. Another patient can move their arms and legs, but the remaining two did not show substantial improvements. While trials have shown that the therapy is safe, it has so far had mixed results. Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the treatment works, but larger trials will be needed.

[### Scientists Just Transplanted a Pig Liver Into a Person for the First Time (7 minute read)](https://singularityhub.com/2025/03/27/scientists-just-transplanted-a-pig-liver-into-a-person-for-the-first-time/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A Chinese team has successfully implanted a genetically modified pig liver into a human. The organ remained functional until the end of the experiment 10 days later - there were no signs of rejection or inflammation. The pig liver is designed to be a stop-gap measure rather than a full replacement. It can keep patients temporarily alive until a human donor organ becomes available or the patient's own liver recovers.

[### How to Write Blog Posts that Developers Read (14 minute read)](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/write-blog-posts-developers-read/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The biggest mistake software bloggers make is meandering - Internet attention spans are short. Readers are looking for relevant material that benefits them, so try to show readers you're writing for them and make it clear how your article will benefit them within the first three sentences. This article teaches techniques that help blog posts succeed and discusses pitfalls that cause some blogs to languish in obscurity. Many errors, once recognized, are easy to fix.

[### Open source devs are fighting AI crawlers with cleverness and vengeance (6 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/open-source-devs-are-fighting-ai-crawlers-with-cleverness-and-vengeance/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sites hosting free and open source projects share most of their infrastructure publicly, so they tend to have fewer resources than commercial products. Many AI bots don't honor the Robots Exclusion Protocol robot.txt file, hide behind other IP addresses, and pretend to be other users, making it difficult to block them. Anubis is a reverse proxy proof-of-work check that must be passed before requests are allowed to hit a server - it blocks bots but lets through browsers operated by humans. It has been popular among the FOSS community as many projects are experiencing the same issue.

[### Apple Needs a Snow Sequoia (7 minute read)](https://reviews.ofb.biz/safari/article/1300.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Snow Leopard was an update released two years after macOS Leopard that added very little and took a lot away. It was one of the most solid software releases Apple has ever put out. Snow Leopard improved the underlying system while shrinking it in size. Apple's latest releases are screaming for such a reset - they feel like software developed by people who don't actually use that software. Snow Leopard's clean-up paved the way for years of solid, reliable upgrades - spring cleaning would make the Mac, iPhone, and iPad really shine.

[### Scarcity and Abundance in 2025 (20 minute read)](https://alexdanco.com/2025/03/27/scarcity-and-abundance-in-2025/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Consumers adopt a new S-curve when they are both overserved by what exists already and also underserved by the existing solution - and like the new thing because it's cheaper and better. Right now, code is capital, but going forward, the true capital asset will be big models and chips - things that you can finance and rent. We are now solidly in the agent S-curve - this will change how we think about software businesses and their profit potential.
