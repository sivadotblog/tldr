[### Elon Musk takes aim at Bill Gates' Microsoft with new AI venture ‚ÄúMacrohard‚Äù (2 minute read)](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-targets-bill-gates-microsoft-new-ai-venture-macrohard/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk's new software venture, Macrohard, is a purely AI software company designed to generate hundreds of specialized coding and generative AI agents that could one day simulate products from companies like Microsoft entirely through artificial intelligence. The company appears to be closely linked to xAI's Colossus 2 supercomputer project in Memphis. Musk has confirmed plans to acquire millions of Nvidia GPUs. Colossus is already one of the most powerful supercomputer clusters in the world, and it is still being expanded.

[### Apple to Kick Off Three-Year Plan to Reinvent Its Iconic iPhone (14 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-24/apple-to-launch-iphone-17-pro-iphone-17-air-in-september-iphone-fold-next-year-mepmzpcj?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjA5ODM1NiwiZXhwIjoxNzU2NzAzMTU2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUhZT1JHUTdMMFUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.RhbXW4MYUSnAbERVkYNEO_YZ78qQtL6Suhih0avdK-A&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple will lay the foundation for a once-in-a-generation iPhone overhaul at its next product launch event. The company has planned three straight years of major iPhone redesigns. The plan starts with the iPhone Air, a skinny new model that follows the MacBook Air laptop strategy. Apple's first foldable iPhone will arrive in 2026. 2027 will see the iPhone's 20th birthday and the introduction of a curved-glass 'iPhone 20'.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### The next Starship flight will test much more than hardware (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/the-next-starship-flight-will-test-much-more-than-hardware/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX has planned for a controlled splashdown for Super Heavy in the Gulf of Mexico and an Indian Ocean splashdown for Ship for the next Starship test flight. The launch window for the flight opened on August 24 at 7:30 PM, but the launch was scrubbed 30 minutes from the planned liftoff to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems. SpaceX has beach and road closures scheduled for Monday and Tuesday all day, so it is highly likely it will reattempt a launch very soon.

[### Meta's New 2mm Laser Display Could Enable True AR Glasses (4 minute read)](https://www.extremetech.com/science/metas-new-2mm-laser-display-could-enable-true-ar-glasses?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta researchers have found a new use for photonic integrated circuits (PICs), chips that can receive, modulate, and direct light. Their PICs can receive RGB light from laser light sources integrated into a panel, process it, then shine light onto a liquid crystal on a silicon panel for final display. The overall complex is just two millimeters thick and has a dramatically better color gamut over similar displays. These PICs are manufactured using a CMOS-compatible process, which means they should be affordable to create at scale.

[### How we vibe code at a FAANG (2 minute read)](https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1myakhd/how_we_vibe_code_at_a_faang/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Always start with a technical design document, as this is where the bulk of the work happens. Design review before launching into the development effort, and backlog development and sprint planning. Use Test Driven Development, and have a dev approval process before code can get merged into main. Test in staging before pushing to production.

[### Everything I know about good API design (23 minute read)](https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-api-design/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

APIs are public interfaces for communicating with a program. Most of what modern software engineers do involves APIs. APIs are hard to build because they're inflexible, but must be easy to adopt. This is a guide on good API design that covers how to change APIs without breaking userspace, how APIs are affected by products, authentication, retries, safety, rate limiting, and much more.

Meta plans to launch its first consumer-ready glasses with a display at its annual Connect conference next month. The company will also launch a wristband that will allow users to control the glasses with hand gestures. The glasses, which will feature a small digital display in the right lens, are expected to cost about $800. They will be solid in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, with which Meta has been in partnership since 2021, when the two companies released the first-generation Ray-Ban Stories.

[### Coinbase CEO explains why he fired engineers who didn't try AI immediately (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/coinbase-ceo-explains-why-he-fired-engineers-who-didnt-try-ai-immediately/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently fired engineers for not signing up for and testing the AI assistants the company purchased licenses for. The firings sent a clear message that AI isn't optional at the company. Armstrong has since leaned even further into AI training. The company hosts monthly meetings where teams that have mastered creative ways to use AI share what they have learned.
