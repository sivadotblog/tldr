[### Google says Microsoft offered to sell Bing to Apple in 2018, but search-quality issues got in the way (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/24/google-says-microsoft-offered-to-sell-bing-to-apple-in-2018.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A document from Google's antitrust case against the US Justice Department revealed that Microsoft offered to sell its Bing search engine to Apple several times over the past few decades, with Apple declining the offer over quality issues every time. Microsoft's almost $100 billion investment into Bing over 20 years was not enough to create a product comparable to Google's. Google's case centers over whether the company has a monopoly in web search. Microsoft's CEO previously testified that he has focused every year of his tenure as CEO to see if Apple would be open to a default search arrangement for Bing.
