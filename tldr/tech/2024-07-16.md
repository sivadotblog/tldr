Cloud cybersecurity company Wiz was founded four years ago by four former Israeli military officers. It grew quickly to become the dominant company in cloud cybersecurity and is headed toward the largest exit for any tech startup since Rivian's $77 billion initial public offering in November 2021.

[### Immunotherapy Is Changing Cancer Treatment Forever (39 minute read)](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/cancer-treatment-immunotherapy-oncology-tcells-brain-tumor.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The human immune system is very good at attacking anything it registers as a disease - if it could be turned against cancer, it could eliminate tumors more thoroughly than surgery and more durably than chemotherapy. Scientists have managed to modify T cells to react to cancer as if it were a virus and destroy it. The therapy has been used to remove glioblastomas, a common type of brain cancer with a median time of diagnosis to death of just over a year.

[### Where's the Synthetic Blood? (32 minute read)](https://www.asimov.press/p/synthetic-blood?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The creation of synthetic blood is one of the holy grails of biomedical research. There are two main approaches to making synthetic blood products: the biologist's approach and the chemist's approach. The biologist's approach involves coaxing stem cells into becoming blood cells, while the chemist's approach synthesizes molecules and particles that mimic the functions of blood cells. Both approaches need to overcome economic and manufacturing challenges before they can scale for use in patients.

[### Why Facebook doesn't use Git (12 minute read)](https://graphite.dev/blog/why-facebook-doesnt-use-git?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Facebook uses Mercurial instead of Git, building custom workflows on top of the tool for performance. Facebook used Git years ago, but it started facing performance issues, and the response from Git maintainers wasn't cooperative, with the maintainers pushing back on improving performance and instead recommending that Facebook shard its monorepo. The Facebook team looked at its alternatives and chose Mercurial, which had a community of maintainers who were welcoming to changes made by them. The story shows how kindness and openness can go far in the world of devtools.
