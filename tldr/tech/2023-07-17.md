The first Tesla Cybertruck electric pickup has been built at Gigafactory Texas. Elon Musk estimated in May that Tesla could sell between 250,000 and 500,000 Cybertrucks a year when production reaches full pace. The Cybertruck's unique design will likely make it one of the most photographed vehicles on the streets when deliveries begin. Production of the Cybertruck is expected to be limited until 2024. Tesla claims to have more than 1.6 million preorders for the vehicle.

[### Sweden is building the world‚Äôs largest wooden city (3 minute read)](https://www.axios.com/2023/07/10/sweden-wooden-city-carbon-emissions?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Swedish developers are building the world's largest wooden city to inspire other similar projects around the world. The city will feature 7,000 office spaces, 2,000 homes, and space for businesses across an area of over 250,000 square meters. Work on the project will begin in 2025 and it is expected to take a decade to complete. Using timber for construction produces significantly lower carbon emissions than using conventional building materials. The project will meet the same high safety requirements as all other constructions, including for fire safety.

[### This Fusion Reactor Is Held Together With Tape (12 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/fusion-2662267312?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Sparc fusion reactor is being built on the site of a former US Army Reserve base near Boston. It will use extremely strong electromagnets created by high-temperature superconducting tape to control plasma during a fusion reaction. The use of the tape will theoretically allow for the construction of high-performance tokamaks much smaller and cheaper than other approaches. It will take 10,000 kilometers of the tape to construct the 18 toroidal field magnets used in the Sparc fusion reactor.
