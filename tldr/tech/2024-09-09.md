[### üÜï Drata and leading auditors announce new Code of Ethics for fair, transparent, and quality-driven audits (Sponsor)](https://drata.com/blog/code-of-ethics?utm_campaign=DR_brand_tldr_mm-ent_leader_Scale2.0_none_AMS_USCA_content_Scale2.0&utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paidnewsletter&utm_content=code-of-ethics&utm_term=USCA_mm-ent_leader_Scale2.0_none)

For an audit to be trustworthy, customers need to be assured of the integrity, objectivity, professionalism, transparency, and high quality of the firm performing the audit. However, standards in this area have traditionally been lax.

The newly-announced [Code of Ethics](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/FPMmAS) outlines principles and guidelines that member firms of the Auditor Alliance are expected to follow. It ensures a [fair, transparent, and quality-driven audit process](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/FPMmAS) for customers seeking compliance with standards, regulations, and frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI, and others.

[### Apple is thinking about a rival to Meta Ray-Ban glasses (2 minute read)](https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-non-ar-smart-glasses-meta-glasses-3479479/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is reportedly considering developing non-AR smart glasses to rival the Meta Ray-Ban glasses. It was previously renewing its efforts to build augmented reality smart glasses but is now considering less ambitious options. Removing AR features should result in a cheaper bill of materials and less complex development, allowing Apple to bring them to market much faster than AR-equipped specs. Samsung is also working on a pair of smart glasses, expected to be powered by Google software.

The next test will involve the first attempt to land Super Heavy back on the launch mount.

[### Common food dye lets scientists see through skin (2 minute read)](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/05/transparent-skin-yellow-food-dye?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Stanford University researchers have discovered a yellow dye that transforms opaque tissue into a transparent window, allowing them to see the inner workings of living animals. Applied to the abdomen of a mouse, the dye allowed scientists to see its liver, small intestine, bladder, and other organs down to the resolution of microns. Rinsing off the dye with water reverses the process. The technology could have many applications, including assisting in the early detection and treatment of cancers. A picture of the transparent mouse abdomen is available in the article.

[### The end of the 1 billion active user ad-supported consumer startup - and why highly-monetizing, useful, vertical apps are the next thing (6 minute read)](https://x.com/andrewchen/status/1832114119207743984?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It might not be possible anymore to create a broadly horizontal consumer app. Easy growth is mostly over and building an ad-supported business is harder than ever. The next generation of apps may be 'vertical apps' that appeal to a vertical market segment with smaller audiences but higher 'whale' monetization. These apps will be focused on solo, useful interactions and may target productivity/utility use cases.
