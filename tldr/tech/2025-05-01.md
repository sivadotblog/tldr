Tools for Humanity, the startup behind the World human verification project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has unveiled a mobile device designed to help people determine the difference between humans and AI agents. The Orb Mini looks like a smartphone, but it has two large sensors on the front to scan users' eyeballs.

[### Judge Rebukes Apple and Orders It to Loosen Grip on App Store (4 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/technology/apple-epic-app-store-ruling.html?unlocked_article_code=1.D08.iHzt.PU6aqTgy477K&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A US federal judge has ruled that Apple must loosen its grip on its App Store and stop collecting a commission on some app sales. Apple was previously ordered to allow apps to provide users with external links to pay developers directly for services to avoid the 30% commission Apple charges. The company instead created a new system that forced apps with external sales to pay a 27% commission to the company and also created pop-up screens that discouraged customers from paying elsewhere. Apple is now restricted from taking commissions from sales outside the App Store and from displaying messages discouraging users from making external purchases. It is being investigated for criminal contempt.

[### Something Alarming Is Happening to the Job Market (5 minute read)](https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/04/job-market-youth/682641/?gift=o6MjJQpusU9ebnFuymVdsJ1qwI70CnAkjDXBfrYqvHw&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share)

Labor conditions for recent college graduates have deteriorated noticeably in the past few months. Unemployment now stands at an unusually high 5.8%. This could be the signal of short-term economic drag, medium-term changes to the value of a college degree, or long-term changes to the relationship between people and AI. Today's graduates are entering into an uncertain economy where some businesses are so focused on tomorrow's profit margin that they're less willing to hire workers who will take time to learn on the job.
