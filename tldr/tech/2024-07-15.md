[### Google reportedly in advanced talks to acquire cyber startup Wiz for $23 billion, its largest-ever deal (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/14/google-wiz-cybersecurity-deal-largest-ever.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google may be acquiring cybersecurity firm Wiz for $23 billion. Wiz, founded in 2020, had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May, when it achieved a valuation of $12 billion. Its security offering gives companies insight into their full cloud presence. If completed, the deal will be Google's largest acquisition yet.

[### SpaceX rocket accident leaves the company's Starlink satellites in the wrong orbit (2 minute read)](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/13/nx-s1-5038517/spacex-rocket-accident-starlink-satellites-orbit?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A SpaceX rocket has failed for the first time in nearly a decade. The upper stage engine of the Falcon 9 rocket malfunctioned several minutes into flight. It left 20 Starlink satellites in an orbit less than half of what was intended. The company is attempting to boost some of the satellites to a higher orbit using onboard ion thrusters, but it is unlikely to be successful. The satellites will likely return to the atmosphere and burn up. The Federal Aviation Administration says the problem must be fixed before SpaceX can fly its Falcon rockets again.

NASA's Parker Solar Probe was recorded traveling at 635,266 kilometers per hour on June 29. It is expected to reach a top speed of around 692,000 kph when it makes its closest approach to the Sun in 2025. The probe uses Venus' gravity to create a sort of gravity-powered slingshot to reach its incredible speeds. It will eventually get within 6.12 million kilometers of the layer of ionized gas considered to be the Sun's surface.

EvolutionaryScale, a company launched by ex-Meta scientists, applies cutting-edge machine learning models trained on language and images to biological data. It has developed a model that speaks the language of proteins called ESM3. ESM3 can be used to create proteins to specifications provided by users. It has been used to create new fluorescent molecules. A small version of the model that was trained without data from specific viruses, pathogens, and toxins has been open sourced.

[### Can ChatGPT do data science? (5 minute read)](https://austinhenley.com/blog/chatgptdatascience.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The challenges of using ChatGPT are worse for data science tasks. Data scientists often work with very large data sets that have quality issues on tasks that may require domain expertise. Using ChatGPT will mean that data scientists also have to understand the context, data, code, and assumptions in ChatGPT's responses. Data scientists are still undecided whether tasks in the field are suitable for ChatGPT or not.

Valve employed just 336 staff in 2021. Its small number of staff across the board seems to explain why the company's product list is so limited despite its immense business. Its profitability per employee is higher than that of Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. A table containing employee pay data from Valve sorted by year and category is available in the article.
