Microsoft considered selling Bing to Apple in 2020 in a deal that would have resulted in Bing replacing Google as the default search engine on Apple devices. Talks between the companies were only exploratory and did not progress.

The Apple/Google deal is currently under scrutiny due to the antitrust trial between Google and the US Department of Justice.
