[### Google's budget-friendly Pixel 9a is finally here, and it comes with a bold new look (3 minute read)](https://www.xda-developers.com/googles-budget-friendly-pixel-9a-release-2025/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google has finally launched the Pixel 9a. Starting at $499, the device, which comes in four colors (Peony, Iris, Porcelain, and Obsidian), is powered by the Google Tensor G4, Google's most efficient processor so far. The Pixel 9a has a 6.3-inch display with 2,700 nits of peak brightness and a 120 Hz adaptive refresh rate. It has a battery life of 30 hours - over 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver enabled. The device has a 13 MP ultra-wide camera and a 48 MP main camera. It is the first Pixel A series device that features Macro Focus.

[### OpenAI's o1-pro is the company's most expensive AI model yet (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/openais-o1-pro-is-its-most-expensive-model-yet/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has launched a more powerful version of its o1 reasoning model in its developer API. o1-pro uses more computing to provide better responses. It costs $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens - ten times the price of regular o1. OpenAI's internal benchmarks show that while o1-pro answers coding and math problems more reliably, it only performs slightly better than the standard o1.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Not Everyone Is Convinced by Microsoft's Topological Qubits (6 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/topological-qubit?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft's quantum team made waves last month by announcing its first topological quantum chip, the Majorana 1. Quantum computers run on qubits valued at 0, 1, or some superposition of the two - topological quantum computing is a fundamentally different approach to building a qubit that would be theoretically less fragile. Proving the claims that it has created at least a single topological qubit remains difficult for the Microsoft team. Despite difficulties, topological quantum continues to be a very promising approach.

[### Amazing New Technology Can 'Bend' Sounds Into Your Ears Only (6 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/amazing-new-technology-can-bend-sounds-into-your-ears-only?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have discovered a way to create localized pockets of sound isolated from their surroundings, creating sound exactly where it needs to be. The technique involves using ultrasound as a carrier for audible sound - ultrasound transports sound through space silently, becoming audible only when desired. The ultrasonic beams can bend as they travel, allowing for the creation of curved sound paths that can navigate around obstacles and meet at a specific target location. Many more details about how this technology works are available in the article.

[### Making AI Work in Legacy Codebases (9 minute read)](https://x.com/austen/status/1902432216829047268?s=12&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI can help engineers even when code bases are big and complex. This article contains several examples of how to use AI on legacy code bases. The examples contain prompts, processes, tool tips, links to resources, and more for better understanding.

[### Not all AI-assisted programming is vibe coding (but vibe coding rocks) (7 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/#atom-everything?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Vibe coding is building software with a large language model without reviewing the code it writes. Making an AI write code, then reviewing that code and testing it thoroughly is not vibe coding - that's just software development. Vibe coding could grant millions of new people the ability to build their own custom tools. It also has a ton to offer experienced developers - it can help them build an intuition as to what AI can and cannot do for them.

[### Elon Musk Is Joining Microsoft in $30 Billion Data Center Project (5 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-is-joining-microsoft-in-30-billion-data-center-project-2000578097?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft, BlackRock, and MGX are partnering with xAI on a $30 billion project to develop data centers and other infrastructure. The details of the new deal are unclear. The relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI has increasingly cooled as Microsoft has loosened its reliance on OpenAI and developed its own in-house AI models. OpenAI recently announced its own $100 billion infrastructure project with Oracle and SoftBank - an early sign that the companies were starting to drift apart.

[### AI is "tearing apart" companies, survey finds (4 minute read)](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/18/enterprise-ai-tension-workers-execs?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Executives across the US have been pushing AI as an inevitable revolution, but workers aren't buying it. Nearly all C-suite executives are unsatisfied with their company's current AI solution - over half say they're looking for new jobs with companies that are more innovative with generative AI. While almost all C-suite executives believe their companies have an AI strategy, just over half of employees say their companies have an AI strategy at all. The pushback from employees seems to stem from both fear of being replaced by AI and AI tools not being suited for work.
