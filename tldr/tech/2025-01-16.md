[### China plans to build enormous solar array in space ‚Äî and it could collect more energy in a year than 'all the oil on Earth' (3 minute read)](https://www.livescience.com/space/space-exploration/china-plans-to-build-enormous-solar-array-in-space-and-it-could-collect-more-energy-in-a-year-than-all-the-oil-on-earth?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese scientists plan to build an enormous, 0.6-mile-wide solar power station in space that will beam continuous energy back to Earth via microwaves. The project has been dubbed 'another Three Gorges Dam project above the Earth'. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest hydropower project. Based in China, it generates 100 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year. The US, EU, and Japan have also been investigating solar satellite array technology - Japan's JAXA is set to launch its proof-of-concept satellite this year.

[### SpaceX launches 2 lunar landers on path to the Moon (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/15/spacex_sends_landers_to_moon/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

[### Designing for developers means designing for LLMs too (3 minute read)](https://encore.dev/blog/llm-instructions?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Most large language models (LLMs) aren't great at using less popular frameworks. This shouldn't be surprising, but it is an important developer experience problem. A simple and effective solution is for the framework to tailor instructions specifically designed for LLMs, rewriting documents, adding conventions and rules, and packaging the instructions. This can make LLMs much better at building apps for less well-known frameworks.

[### Structured Logprobs (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/arena-ai/structured-logprobs?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This Python library enhances OpenAI chat completion response by adding detailed information about token log properties. It works with OpenAI Structured Outputs, a feature that ensures models will always generate responses that add here to a supplied JSON Schema. The library provides utilities for analyzing and incorporating token-level log probabilities into structured outputs to help developers understand the reliability of structured data extracted from OpenAI models.

[### NYC Congestion Pricing: Early Days (28 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GN8SrMxw3WEAtfrFS/nyc-congestion-pricing-early-days?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article looks at the effects of congestion pricing and its impacts on traffic, time, enforcement, rideshare services, the people living in congestion pricing zones, and more. New York City now has congestion pricing - people have to pay $9 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. This has dramatically improved traffic in tunnels and bridges. The policy is aimed in part at getting people to switch from cars to trains, but trains have not seemed more crowded than usual.

[### The Downfall of India's Hot Startup Is Wiping Out US Debtholders (6 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/the-downfall-of-india-s-hot-startup-is-wiping-out-us-debtholders?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNzAwMDA4NywiZXhwIjoxNzM3NjA0ODg3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTTlZaUEVEV0xVNjkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9._4zcNFhRdUVkphC4P3CA3q93WM1hDwBKd1egNMsSZDg&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Byju's, the most valuable startup in India's history, was willing to pay handsomely to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars in the US. It received $1.2 billion towards a global expansion. The company collapsed, setting off legal proceedings that may leave investors recouping only a small fraction of what they're owed. The case is a lesson about the perils of lending when money can rapidly disappear across borders.
