[### The first cubesat to fly and operate at the Moon has successfully arrived (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/the-first-cubesat-to-fly-and-operate-at-the-moon-has-successfully-arrived/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The CAPSTONE spacecraft has successfully entered into lunar orbit. It will continue to refine its orbit over the next few days and become the first cubesat to fly and operate at the Moon. The cubesat passes within 3,000 km of the lunar surface at its closest point during its roughly week-long orbit. It is 70,000 km away at other points. NASA plans to build a small space station in this orbit later this decade.

Researchers at the National Ignition Facility have created burning plasma, an energized state of matter that is mostly sustained by alpha particles created by fusion reactions. They have also produced self-sustaining fusion reactions, a major breakthrough. Particles inside burning plasma have unexpectedly high energies that could reveal new physics important for achieving robust and reproducible ignition. It will likely still be decades before a fusion reactor is developed, assuming it is possible.

A very small number of people in the US have experienced myocarditis after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine based on mRNA technology. Most have fully recovered. There is no evidence of an increased risk of cardiac-related death from the condition. Myocarditis has long been linked to a number of viral infections. The first research tracking adverse health effects following a diagnosis of vaccine-associated heart problems is underway.

Waymo has been quietly investing in weather research since its early days. The company uses its technology to create a meteorological metric that its autonomous 'Waymo Driver' uses for decision-making. Its robotaxis have gradually become mobile weather stations. Traditional weather stations are mostly located at airports to support aviation safety. Waymo's system is able to show more localized and relevant weather information.
