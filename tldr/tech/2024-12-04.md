[### The Furious Contest to Unseat Nvidia as King of A.I. Chips (10 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/technology/nvidia-ai-chips.html?unlocked_article_code=1.e04.EV5R.e5ZJ-MTPy9SF&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon, AMD, and several other startups are starting to offer credible alternatives to Nvidia's chips. Nvidia's rivals are proving they can deliver faster speeds at lower prices for some crucial AI tasks. Many are emulating Nvidia's tactic of building complete computers so that customers can gain maximum power and performance out of their chips. Spending on computers without Nvidia chips by data center operators is expected to grow 49% this year to $126 billion.

E11 Bio has been working for the past three years to develop techniques to make brain mapping better, cheaper, and faster. One of these approaches involves making the brain label itself by injecting it with viruses that cause neurons to make special proteins that act like barcodes. The approach reduces the amount of brain slicing required and creates more accurate wiring maps that require less proofreading. E11 is now shifting from proof-of-concept mode to building out its imaging infrastructure so it can tackle an entire mouse brain.

Adchemy was attempting to court funding from Microsoft - Altman had a contact at Microsoft tell Adchemy that it would be problematic if the company was embroiled in litigation while discussing the deal, so Adchemy dropped the suit
