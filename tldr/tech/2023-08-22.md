Developers LOVE generative AI‚Ä¶

With AI, devs are writing more code than ever. And development materials aren‚Äôt just in the IDE ‚Äî they‚Äôre all over the place (Notebooks, browsers, screenshots‚Ä¶)

This is where most copilots fall short. You need a tool that can help you curate and understand the increasingly complex workflows where code is generated.

And that‚Äôs [exactly what Pieces for Developers built](https://code.pieces.app/blog/introducing-pieces-copilot?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr-copilot-promotion).

SoftBank, which owns Arm, is aiming to bounce back from a grim tech market and pivot its focus to artificial intelligence.

[### SpaceX‚Äôs new Bandwagon program is a big threat to small launch providers (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/spacexs-new-bandwagon-program-is-a-big-threat-to-small-launch-providers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX is expanding its Rideshare program to meet the demand for launches to mid-inclination orbits. The new program was quietly announced at a space industry conference earlier this month. Mid-inclination orbits are appealing to a growing number of customers. SpaceX currently has four mid-inclination orbit missions booked between 2024 and 2025. The new Rideshare program could be a major threat to small launch providers.

[### China keeps buying hobbled Nvidia cards to train its AI models (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/china-keeps-buying-hobbled-nvidia-cards-to-train-its-ai-models/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China's leading tech companies have placed orders for $5 billion worth of chips from Nvidia, despite the fact that the chips have been deliberately hobbled to limit their capabilities for the Chinese market. Worries that the US might tighten its export controls further have prompted more orders. Training requirements for the most advanced AI systems doubles every six to 12 months, so the gap between chips sold in China and those available elsewhere will grow quickly.

The Pyxis Ocean, chartered by shipping firm Cargill, has set out on its maiden voyage. The ship has wind-powered sails that are designed to cut fuel consumption. It will travel from China to Brazil to test the technology and provide an opportunity to assess whether traditional methods of propelling ships could be the way forward for moving cargo at sea. The sails could help save 20 tonnes of CO2 per day per ship.
