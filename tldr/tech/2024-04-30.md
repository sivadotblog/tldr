[### ChatGPT's AI ‚Äòmemory' can remember the preferences of paying customers (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144680/chatgpt-plus-memory-chatbot-subscription-details-preferences-personal-assistant?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's Memory feature, which allows ChatGPT to store queries, prompts, and other customizations, is now available to ChatGPT Plus paying subscribers outside of Europe and Korea. Memory lets users tell ChatGPT to remember certain details and allows the chatbot to learn from conversations. Users have control over what ChatGPT retains and what is used for additional training. ChatGPT will tell users when memories are updated. The feature will eventually roll out ChatGPT Enterprise and Teams, but OpenAI has not specified when.

[### Musk Wins China's Backing for Tesla's Driver-Assistance Service (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/tesla-wins-chinas-backing-for-driver-assistance-service-20816802?st=3laq31aqlggb6bs&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China's government has signaled its blessing for Tesla to roll out its advanced driver-assistance service in the country. Tesla will deploy its Full Self-Driving service based on mapping and navigation functions provided by Baidu. Being able to roll out FSD in China will help Tesla compete with major Chinese carmakers, some of which already provide higher-level driver-assistance features. Chinese officials have yet to respond to Elon Musk's request to transfer the data that Tesla cars collect in China to the US to further train the system.

[### China ready to launch lunar far side sample return mission (4 minute read)](https://spacenews.com/china-ready-to-launch-lunar-far-side-sample-return-mission/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China's Chang'e-6 mission aims to land on the far side of the moon and collect up to 2,000 grams of lunar material to return to Earth. The mission will also include international scientific payloads from France, Sweden, Italy, and Pakistan. The launch time has yet to be disclosed, but navigation warnings indicate that the launch is expected early Friday. China plans to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030 and establish a permanent lunar base through the International Lunar Research Station program in the 2030s.

[### Atomic Nucleus Excited with Laser: A Breakthrough after Decades (7 minute read)](https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/lange-erhoffter-durchbruch-erstmals-atomkern-mit-laser-angeregt?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The long-sought thorium transition has been found. This discovery promises revolutionary technological applications and could answer the question of whether the constants of nature are actually constant or whether they change in space and time. It makes it possible to combine classical quantum physics and nuclear physics. The technology can be used for precision measurements. It could create new types of clocks that would be significantly more accurate than the best atomic clocks available today and devices that analyze the gravitational field around Earth to provide indications of mineral resources or earthquakes.
