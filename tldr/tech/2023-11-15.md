[### SpaceX to Launch Starship‚Äôs Second Orbital Test This Weekend: What to Know (3 minute read)](https://observer.com/2023/11/spacex-starship-second-orbital-test/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX may launch the second Starship orbital test as soon as this Friday. Elon Musk said on X that SpaceX will receive a launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration in time for the launch. The last orbital attempt was almost seven months ago - it ended in a mid-air explosion that led to a months-long federal investigation. The FAA and the US Fish and Wildlife Service have yet to announce the completion of an environmental review for the test. The most critical part of the test flight will be hot staging, where Starship's upper stage separates from its boost and ignites its own engines.

[### AI outperforms conventional weather forecasting for the first time: Google study (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/ai-outperforms-conventional-weather-forecasting-for-the-first-time-google-study/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An AI meteorology model from Google DeepMind called GraphCast significantly outperforms conventional weather forecasting methods in predicting global weather conditions up to 10 days in advance. GraphCast outperformed the world's leading conventional system in 90% of 1,380 metrics. It can predict hundreds of weather variables over 10 days at 0.25¬∞ resolution globally in under a minute. GraphCast is estimated to be about 1,000 times cheaper in terms of energy consumption compared to traditional methods.
