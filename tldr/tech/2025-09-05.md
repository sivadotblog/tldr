[### An ant queen mass produces cloned sons of ANOTHER SPECIES (1 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1963684193973727645.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An ant queen from the species Messor ibericus was observed producing cloned males of another species, Messor structor. The two species split about 5 million years ago. When the Messor ibericus queen makes daughters, she mixes her DNA with sperm to create hybrids, but when she makes sons, she erases her own DNA entirely, resulting in males that are exact clones. The queen had stored the sperm of the other species in her reproductive tract, resulting in sons with the other species' genome.

[### How I solved a distributed queue problem after 15 years (4 minute read)](https://www.dbos.dev/blog/durable-queues?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Reddit used a simple and scalable queue architecture to record upvotes that scaled well, but broke in all sorts of tricky ways. The company eventually moved to durable queues, which enabled failed jobs to resume from their last completed step, meaning no data was lost when there were program crashes. Durable queues work by combining task queues with durable workflows, which helps reliably orchestrate workflows of many parallel tasks. Architecturally, they resemble conventional queues, but use a persistent store as both message broker and backend.
