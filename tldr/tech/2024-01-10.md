[### The Rabbit R1 is an AI-powered gadget that can use your apps for you (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24030667/rabbit-r1-ai-action-model-price-release-date?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Rabbit R1 is a $199 standalone device about half the size of an iPhone powered by a 'Large Action Model'. It has a 2.88-inch touchscreen, a rotating camera for taking photos and videos, a scroll wheel/button for navigation, 128GB of storage, and a battery that lasts all day. The device runs on Rabbit OS, which features a universal controller for apps that can control music, order items from the internet, send messages, and more. It is trained on how to use existing apps for itself and has a dedicated training mode for users to teach it tasks, so developers don't have to do anything to support the device. A 26-minute-long introduction video from Rabbit about the device is available in the article.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### How Microsoft found a potential new battery material using AI (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/24027031/microsoft-new-solid-state-battery-material-ai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have found a new battery material using AI and large-scale cloud computing. The material is a new kind of solid-state electrolyte. It could lead to batteries that are less likely to burst into flames compared to lithium-ion batteries. While the material still needs to be tested to see whether it is a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries, the finding demonstrates AI's potential for speeding up material discovery.

[### Potent psychedelic drug banishes PTSD, small study finds (3 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00012-z?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A small trial on military veterans suggests that ibogaine, a potent psychedelic drug, could be used to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI). The study found that veterans with TBI symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression had the symptoms decrease by more than 80% on average after treatment. Ibogaine seems to have a broad, dramatic, and consistent effect. The data supports launching rigorous trials to test the drug.

[### It‚Äôs Humans All the Way Down (2 minute read)](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/humans-all-the-way-down/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

People think that AI is going to replace a lot of jobs because everyone thinks that everyone else's job is easy. The desire to remove humans from the equation is based on ignorance. Even with the wildest of innovations, people still matter, and this can't be avoided. People want to appeal to other humans and be seen and understood.
