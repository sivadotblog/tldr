[### OpenAI plans app store for AI software, The Information reports (2 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-app-store-ai-software-information-2023-06-20/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI plans to launch a marketplace for AI models built on top of its technology. Enterprise customers often tailor OpenAI's technology to their specific use cases. The marketplace would allow these customers to make their models available to other businesses. It will compete with other app stores, including one by Microsoft, and help OpenAI's technology reach more people.

[### Rivian is the next automaker to adopt Tesla's charging plugs (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/rivian-is-the-next-automaker-to-adopt-teslas-charging-plugs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Combined Changing System (CCS) standard's connector and cable are big and unwieldy, unlike Tesla's more elegant alternative, the North American Charging Standard (NACS). Rivian will start building NACS ports into its vehicles in 2025. It will make adaptors available for its customers. Tesla charging sites will be added to Rivian's mobile and vehicle navigation apps.

[### RoboCat: A self-improving robotic agent (5 minute read)](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/robocat-a-self-improving-robotic-agent?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

RoboCat is a self-improving AI agent for robotics. It learns to perform tasks across different arms and then self-generates new training data to improve its technique. RoboCat can solve and adapt to multiple tasks across different robots. It learns much faster than other state-of-the-art models, picking up new tasks with as few as 100 demonstrations. A video demonstrating RoboCat's abilities is available in the article.

[### DeepMind's co-founder suggested testing an AI chatbot's ability to turn $100,000 into $1 million to measure human-like intelligence (4 minute read)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepminds-co-founder-suggested-testing-135637525.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABAbuc3XG92O41RKUgnIHj8dgI55xZS6ISiq-hdeMR4jJYGiQL2KeZo2nrJBzFvm9h63aM7oui9xV1_Ma6dlMLvyjELbGHzua1SKWeK-F-phZXL5j62gGLdih5-PXjOWY6WQkA5qcAbjKbI2XUgSsWcDc4UA6DosUoHE2Pnkk8KU?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mustafa Suleyman, formerly head of applied AI at DeepMind and now CEO and co-founder of Inflection AI, believes that the Turing test is an outdated method to test AI intelligence. The Turing test doesn't reveal information about what systems understand, whether they have established complex internal monologues, or if they engage in planning over abstract time horizons. Suleyman proposes a concept called artificial capable intelligence (ACI), where bots are able to complete short-term goals and tasks with little human input. Bots can achieve ACI by passing a modern Turing test that involves turning a $100,000 seed investment into $1 million. Suleyman believes that AI will be able to achieve that milestone in the next two years.

[### Not That Kind of Open (3 minute read)](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Some Mastodon/Fediverse administrators have pledged to preemptively block Meta's upcoming ActivityPub service. ActivityPub makes social networking truly open. Blocking Meta from participating in the protocol seems to go against that ideal. There are billions of people who use Meta's services and there is no reason to cut them off from the ActivityPub social world.

Almost everyone has a side hustle. Even many leaders have significant side hustles. Remote work means that people no longer have to hide their other gigs from their co-workers. Many founders and CEOs don't like this. Side hustles are a distraction to workers' full-time jobs. While people can be good at doing more than one thing, being truly great requires full commitment.
