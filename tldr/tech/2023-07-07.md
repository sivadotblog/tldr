[### Revolutionary gel allows metal items to be 3D printed at room temperature (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/3d-printing/copper-gel-3d-printed-metal-room-temperature/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new type of gel allows 3D printers to print heat-sensitive electronics. It enables the 3D printing of metal objects at room temperature. The gel temporarily turns a metal alloy into a liquid-metal state - it becomes rigid and highly electrically conductive after it is left to dry. It can create objects that can change shape in a predictable fashion if heat is applied while it is drying, allowing for the production of items with complex 3D shapes that are easier to print as a flat pattern.

Some people really think that AI is a magical thing that can fix all their problems. This article gives an example of a company that is using AI to generate JIRA tickets, code, and HR documents without any care about quality or security or checks for legality.
