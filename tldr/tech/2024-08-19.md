Fortnite is now back on iOS, but only in the EU. Epic has launched its games store on iOS (EU only) and Android. It currently only has three games, but Epic is working on bringing developers into its store. Fortnite was pulled from the Apple App Store four years ago, resulting in a legal battle that loosened Apple's grip on its platform but kept the status quo for the most part.

[### Designer Babies Are Here ‚Äî So Why Aren't We Talking About It? (9 minute read)](https://www.inverse.com/health/designer-babies-are-here-so-why-arent-we-talking-about-it?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While human prenatal genome editing, which involves editing the DNA of a fetus visible inside the womb, has not happened yet as far as we know, the societal implications of the technology are still vast. The technology offers a chance to address cellular disease processes early and prevent symptoms from ever appearing. However, there are many ethical issues with using the technology. This article presents a summary of the many issues surrounding human prenatal genome editing and how it may affect society in the future.

[### The invisible problem with sending people to Mars (11 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221102/mars-colony-space-radiation-cosmic-ray-human-biology?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There are obvious challenges to getting people to Mars, but the biggest obstacle might be something that's totally invisible and often overlooked: space radiation. Scientists are just beginning to learn about the many ways that exposure to space radiation can impact human health. The effects of space radiation may also combine with other factors such as sleep deprivation and microgravity - there is not enough information yet about how these factors interact. Finding ways to mitigate these effects will determine whether people will ever be able to visit Mars safely.

[### Roblox is Already the Biggest Game In The World. Why Can't It Make a Profit (And How Can It)? (29 minute read)](https://www.matthewball.co/all/roblox2024?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

More than 80 million people log into Roblox on average every day. Despite its linear growth, which is expected to continue, Roblox is very unprofitable. Its impressive rate of revenue growth has been outpaced by its costs. The company loses 49% of its revenue to app stores and content creators before it even gets into infrastructure and other costs. Roblox is increasingly focused on using generative AI and other features to attract more players, especially older players with money to spend and the discretion to spend it.

Sam Altman's Worldcoin project has come under assault by authorities all over the world. More than a dozen jurisdictions have either suspended the project's operations or looked into its data processing. Worldcoin verifies people by using their irises, which it claims are better at distinguishing humans than fingerprints or faces. While the company says its technology is completely private, authorities are concerned that it could be used to build a global biometric database with little oversight.
