[### System metrics are cool. But why aren't you running developer surveys? (Sponsor)](https://www.swarmia.com/product/surveys/?utm_campaign=TLDR&amp;utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=cpv&amp;utm_content=august23)

There are some questions only engineers can answer. Do we have proper tools for debugging production issues? is hard to answer just from looking at cycle times. To understand how to improve developer experience and productivity, you need to [combine system metrics with developer feedback](https://www.swarmia.com/product/surveys/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=email&utm_medium=cpv&utm_content=august23).

Using [Swarmia's survey feature](https://www.swarmia.com/product/surveys/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=email&utm_medium=cpv&utm_content=august23), you can build recurring engineering surveys by selecting relevant questions from a [research-backed survey framework](https://www.swarmia.com/product/surveys/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=email&utm_medium=cpv&utm_content=august23).

Choose the questions you'd like to include in each survey to measure the change in developer sentiment over time. Send [automatic reminders over Slack,](https://www.swarmia.com/product/surveys/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=email&utm_medium=cpv&utm_content=august23) and keep everything secure with zero fuss.

[### Slim iPhone 17 model is just a ‚Äústep toward something better‚Äù (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/11/gurman-slim-iphone-17-foldable/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is reportedly planning a slim iPhone model for next year. The iPhone 17 'Air' will have a smaller Dynamic Island, an aluminum chassis, a 6.6-inch display, and a lesser camera setup. It is designed to look much cooler than the standard iPhone without the performance, screen size, or cameras of a Pro model. The new slim model is expected to be a bigger hit than the iPhone 12/13 mini and the iPhone 14/15/16 Plus.

[### AI is mining the sum of human knowledge from Wikipedia. What does that mean for its future? (11 minute read)](https://sherwood.news/tech/ai-is-mining-the-sum-of-human-knowledge-from-wikipedia-what-does-that-mean/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The proliferation of AI tools means there's a growing disconnect between where people are getting their information and where it comes from. This could affect contributions to Wikipedia in the long run as people are less likely to contribute if they don't visit the site directly. Wikipedia hasn't seen any decline in traffic due to AI so far. Without clear attribution and source links, AI applications risk introducing an unprecedented amount of misinformation into the world.

[### Novel Ideas to Cool Data Centers: Liquid in Pipes or a Dunking Bath (7 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/novel-ideas-to-cool-data-centers-liquid-in-pipes-or-a-dunking-bath-cdb7a393?st=5rm9dyl3gs2siq1&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia's upcoming GB200 server racks will be mainly cooled with liquid circulated in tubes. The company is also working on other cooling technologies, including one that involves dunking entire computers in a non-conductive liquid that absorbs and dissipates heat. Cooling accounts for a significant amount of power consumption in data centers. Liquid-cooled data centers would be able to pack much more computing power in the same space.

[### 621-mph maglev vacuum train "T-Flight" test successful (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/transport/tflight-chinese-maglev-train-test-successful/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) has successfully tested its ultra-high-speed maglev train under low vacuum conditions. The test showed that all systems were nominal. CASIC plans to run the train at its full 621 mph speed in the second phase of testing, which will require an extended track. There may also be phase 3 tests targeting 2,485 mph.

[### Why I bet on DSPy (11 minute read)](https://blog.isaacmiller.dev/posts/dspy?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

DSPy is an open source framework that helps developers compose multiple large language model (LLM) calls together in a principled manner to solve a problem. LLMs are good at pattern matching, matching distributions, and being creative. DSPy uses this to create 'reasoning systems' that can actually perform what they're supposed to. While there are issues with the framework, there is a community behind the project that is working together to improve it.

[### Individual efficiency vs administrative efficiency (11 minute read)](https://longform.asmartbear.com/tension-autonomy-admin/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

In a perfect world, everyone would be able to use their own favorite tools, but this doesn't always work out in real world settings where teams have to work and collaborate together. While individual autonomy should be the main goal, local optimization doesn't lead to global optimization, which is what organizations should be aiming for. There are many legitimate times when administrative needs should supersede the individual. This article looks at when policies should optimize for the efficiency and happiness of the individual and when they should optimize for the team or company.

[### What Google rivals want after DOJ's antitrust trial win (5 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/11/24216760/google-trial-monopoly-remedies-rivals?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While Google has been ruled as an illegal monopoly, the Department of Justice has yet to announce what remedies it will seek. It has previously indicated that any remedies would be structural, meaning break-ups rather than mandates to change certain behaviors. Google rivals have suggested changes such as choice screens that pop up periodically, a ban on dark pattern popups that push people back to the default, and barring Google from buying default status or pre-installation and self-preferencing its own content in serve results. The final decision will be at least as consequential as the Microsoft antitrust case 23 years ago, which spurred an era of unprecedented innovation that allowed promising startups to flourish - including Google.
