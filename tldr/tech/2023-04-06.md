A security researcher has warned that a leading garage door controller is highly vulnerable to security and privacy threats. Nexx's controllers, which can open/close garage doors and control home security alarms and smart power plugs, employ a universal password which leaves devices vulnerable. The email address, device ID, first name, last initial, and message are also broadcasted on unencrypted channels. Anyone can access Nexx servers and issue commands to the controller. Nexx's home security alarms are similarly at risk. The Texas-based company has failed to respond to multiple warning messages about the vulnerabilities.
