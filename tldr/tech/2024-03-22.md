### Big Tech & Startups

[### U.S. Sues Apple, Accusing It of Maintaining an iPhone Monopoly (12 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/technology/apple-doj-lawsuit-antitrust.html?ugrp=u&amp;unlocked_article_code=1.ek0.0fRF.C1pyqxqK98p6&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is being sued by the US for employing a strategy that relies on exclusionary anticompetitive conduct that hurts both consumers and developers. The 88-page lawsuit says that the company violated antitrust laws with practices that were intended to keep customers reliant on their iPhones and make them less likely to switch to competing devices. It seeks to put an end to those practices and possibly a breakup of the company. The lawsuit is likely to drag out for years before any type of resolution.

[### Here‚Äôs how Microsoft is providing a ‚Äògood outcome‚Äô for Inflection AI VCs, as Reid Hoffman promised (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/21/microsoft-inflection-ai-investors-reid-hoffman-bill-gates/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Unnamed sources say that Microsoft is paying approximately $650 million in its deal with Inflection AI. $620 million was paid for non-exclusive licensing fees for Inflection's technology and $30 million was paid to get Inflection to agree not to sue over Microsoft's poaching. Inflection will pivot away from building a personalized AI chatbot to becoming an AI studio that helps other companies work with large language model AI. Microsoft has several reasons for needing a backup for OpenAI - for one, its deal with OpenAI is being scrutinized by the FTC.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### The Baffling Intelligence of a Single Cell/ (51 minute read)](https://jsomers.net/e-coli-chemotaxis/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

E. coli cells forage for nutrients using a process called chemotaxis. While the bacteria don't have brains, they possess something similar to a sense of smell, drive, and even memory. Chemotaxis involves 'smelling' chemicals and then deciding where to swim. The system is able to adapt to different environments with varying levels of attractant concentration. This article introduces the clever system that powers chemotaxis and explains how the complex signaling network works.

[### Pig kidney transplanted into living person for first time (6 minute read)](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/health/pig-kidney-transplant-living-person/index.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Doctors have performed a pig-to-human kidney transplant for the first time at Massachusetts General Hospital, the first hospital to perform a kidney transplant. The genetically modified kidney was implanted into a 62-year-old patient who had been diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease. They are recovering well and are expected to be discharged from the hospital soon. It is unknown how long the kidney will last for. This was the third transplant of a pig organ into a living human. The first two patients, who received heart transplants, died weeks after receiving their organs.

[### Choosing startup life (12 minute read)](https://mirror.xyz/brunny.eth/CyjJBx4Vee-IJGyu52WNI93umtnX0LwtksFn3S3VSdI?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article discusses things to consider when thinking about joining a startup. A job may provide higher salaries, more perks, security, less stress, and other benefits, but working in a startup can result in huge payoffs. Startups require a ton of challenging work to be successful, they have minimal infrastructure in place, and startup employees have lower salaries. However, startup employees own a portion of the company, and this could be worth a lot in the future.

[### The Reddits (6 minute read)](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/the-reddits?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Reddit was one of the reasons Y Combinator was started. This post tells the story of how the site came to be. Despite being rejected in the first round for their food delivery app idea, Reddit's founders were offered funding after agreeing to work on a project that would eventually become Reddit. The project was launched on a quick schedule. It had a core set of real users after just a few weeks. Reddit is now a fundamentally useful tool that seems almost unkillable.
