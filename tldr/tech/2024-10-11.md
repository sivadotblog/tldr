Tesla has unveiled the Cybercab, a new electric vehicle dedicated to self-driving that lacks a steering wheel or pedals. It will need approval from regulators before going into production. The robotaxi features a futuristic design with doors that open upward and a small cabin with only enough space for two passengers. It doesn't have a charging plug - the vehicle will use inductive charging to regain power wirelessly. Tesla plans to have the Cybercab in production by 2026, although that could be delayed until 2027.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Can Apple Watch measure blood pressure? Not yet ‚Äî but here's how the science would work. (5 minute read)](https://www.empirical.health/blog/apple-watch-blood-pressure/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This post explains the science behind blood pressure detection on the wrist, past medical literature on using deep neural networks to glean signals from consumer wearables, likely limitations of wrist-based blood pressure sensors, and how doctors and patients can incorporate the technology into medical practice. 120 million people in the US have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, but only 23% have it under control. A continuous blood pressure monitor could help give real-time feedback on dietary choices and help control the condition, which in turn could lower heart attack rates.

[### Forking is Beautiful (1 minute read)](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/spoon/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

FreeWP is a fork of WordPress started by a former WordPress community member. The last decent fork attempt for WordPress was ClassicPress in 2018, which started over disagreements about Gutenberg being integrated into core. WordPress itself started as a fork of the b2/cafelog project. Matt Mullenweg, co-creator of WordPress, strongly encourages anyone who disagrees with the direction WordPress is headed in to join the FreeWP fork.

[### Generative AI's Act o1 (22 minute read)](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ais-act-o1/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Research in AI is progressing from 'thinking fast' to 'thinking slow', unlocking a new cohort of agentic applications. The focus is now shifting to the development and scaling of the reasoning layer, which could endow AI systems with deliberate reasoning, problem-solving, and cognitive operations at inference time that go beyond rapid pattern matching. This essay explores how the consolidation of the foundational LLM layer has set the stage for the race to scale higher-order reasoning and agentic capabilities, and discusses a new generation of killer apps with novel cognitive architectures and user interfaces.
