The announcement around the Stargate project made it clear that Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI was to evolve, allowing OpenAI to use other cloud providers. Microsoft is not fully breaking up with OpenAI - it will remain a key partner in many regards. However, what was a tight coupling of OpenAI and Microsoft will now be a tight coupling of OpenAI and SoftBank.

[### How to Make Superbabies (64 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DfrSZaf3JC8vJdbZL/how-to-make-superbabies?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Genetic technology could create humans that live longer, have the raw intellectual power to do Nobel Prize-worthy scientific research, and very rarely suffer from health disorders. Scientists don't do this though due to ethical issues. As a result, there is a lot of low-hanging fruit in this field of research. This post looks into how to do large-scale, heritable editing of the human genome to improve everything from diabetes risk to intelligence. It summarizes the state of knowledge in the field and lays out a technical roadmap that examines how remaining barriers may be overcome.

[### Earth's 1st Asteroid Mining Prospector Heads to the Launchpad (7 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/science/astroforge-launch-asteroid-mining.html?unlocked_article_code=1.zU4.6ExW.LuSPQfsx7rIO&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AstroForge is planning to heave a microwave oven-sized spacecraft toward an asteroid later this week as part of the company's plans to create a future where precious metals are mined around the solar system. Its Odin spacecraft will launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as soon as Wednesday. Odin's target is an object called 2022 OB5, which is about the size of a football field and is likely to contain a high amount of metal. Odin will arrive in late 2025 after a journey of about 300 days.

[### How to Build an LLM Chat App: The New Litmus Test for Junior Devs (4 minute read)](https://x.com/alxfazio/status/1893242657331101976?s=12&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Building an LLM (Large Language Model) chat app is way more complicated than just making an API call. There are many considerations required - building an LLM chat app is the gauntlet that separates the juniors from the devs who actually know what they are doing. This article discusses how to start building a scalable LLM chat app. Learning how to build the backend architecture allows developers to build better apps that can handle more users and dodge the shame of a launch-day crash.

[### Why I think AI take-off is relatively slow (3 minute read)](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/why-i-think-ai-take-off-is-relatively-slow.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A large part of the economy just won't adopt AI or use it effectively all that quickly. As AI becomes more productive, human bottlenecks will become more important. Not all bottlenecks will be regulatory: there will be slow adopters, people in the workplace who hate AI, energy constraints, and other factors. It is the worst performer who sets the overall level of productivity - soon, the worst performer will be humans. While AI could boost economic rates, that reality will still be a few decades out, if it happens.

[### The Profitable Startup (4 minute read)](https://linear.app/blog/the-profitable-startup?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The thinking that startups should prioritize growth over everything else, even profitability, was always flawed - profitability isn't unambitious. It means not relying on investors for survival and being able to focus on an unaltered vision and mission. It's now easy to be profitable while also growing fast. The factor holding founders back is rarely team size - it's the clarity of their focus, skill, and ability to execute. Measure what matters, understand your risk profile, hire intentionally and slowly, and raise on your own terms.
