Apple is reportedly spending millions of dollars a day on AI product research with the goal of creating a Siri that can automate tasks involving multiple steps. Most of the budget is dedicated to model training, which requires a lot of expensive hardware. The company has been working on large language models for four years, but it is unclear what it has achieved with its multi-year lead. Apple's internal chatbot apparently boasts greater capabilities than OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, but is less intelligent than GPT-4.

Semiglutide was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes. It may also reduce heart failure and provide more general cardiovascular benefits. Weekly injections of the drug can reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack by 20%. While scientists don't entirely know how the drug works, studies show that it may have many other uses, such as in reducing alcohol consumption. The manufacturer that produces the drug plans to seek regulatory approval in the US and Europe for more uses.

[### Commit Mono (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/eigilnikolajsen/commit-mono?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Commit Mono is a neutral programming typeface designed to create a better reading experience. It is designed to be quietly useful without an eye-catching design or any confusing ligatures. Commit Mono is inspired by common fonts. It uses an innovative technique that creates better spacing positions while preserving monospacing to improve kerning, creating a superior reading experience compared to other monospaced fonts.

This article discusses how to build and scale applications that use large language models. It took GitHub three years to develop GitHub Copilot from idea to production. The team used a three-stage plan for development: they identified an impactful problem space for their LLM application, created a smooth AI product experience, and then got the application ready and usable for general availability. Further resources on developing LLM applications are provided at the end of the article.

[### Cory Doctorow: Interoperability Can Save the Open Web (6 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/doctorow-interoperability?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cory Doctorow's latest book, The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation, presents a case for disrupting Big Tech, arguing that Big Tech's walled gardens are fenced in by legal structures, not feats of engineering. Forcing interoperability could break down these walls and make the Internet freer and more democratic. This article features an interview with Doctorow, where he discusses how interoperability could break up monopolies in Big Tech and beyond.
