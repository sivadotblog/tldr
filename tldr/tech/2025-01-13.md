The Supreme Court seems likely to uphold the law that would ban TikTok in the US. A preliminary decision is expected within days. There remains some uncertainty on how the court will handle the case, especially with President-elect Donald Trump taking office a day after the deadline for the law to take effect. The court has the authority to temporarily block the law even if it ultimately rules against TikTok.

[### Jeff Bezos's New Glenn rocket launch canceled after hours of delays (11 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/science/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-new-glenn-launch.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ok4.CmLY.Y9hwgz35FkDx&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket launch at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida was called off this morning after hours of delays. As tall as a 32-story building, the rocket was set to launch on January 10, but the launch was postponed due to choppy seas in the Atlantic Ocean where the booster is supposed to land. New Glenn is designed to carry larger satellites and other payloads than other rockets in operation today. Its success could inject competition into the rocket business, which is currently dominated by one company - SpaceX.

[### Introducing Werk üíÖ (Website)](https://simonask.github.io/introducing-werk/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

werk is a simplistic and easy-to-use portable build system and command runner. It solves several problems with `make` and `just`. Developers just have to parse a Werkfile containing recipes to werk and it will determine what the user wants to build, what the dependencies are, and run programs to rebuild any outdated build products in the right order. It uses a new language, but the language is able to express the kind of things developers really want to express in build scripts and fairly pleasant and readable.

[### Apple is Killing Swift (14 minute read)](https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/apple-is-killing-swift?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article looks at how modern programming languages are governed and explains how Swift's dictatorial structure is uniquely terrible. Swift was originally a passion project by Chris Lattner, the senior director of dev tooling at Apple. The language has evolved into a complicated mess - it now has 217 keywords. While Apple is unambiguously the dictator of Swift, its incentives put the company at odds with the open-source community. The company's updates to the language show how much it doesn't care about the community.

[### Mark Zuckerberg slams Apple on its lack of innovation and ‚Äòrandom rules' (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/11/mark-zuckerberg-slams-apple-on-its-lack-of-innovation-and-random-rules.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently criticized Apple's lackluster innovation efforts and 'random rules' during an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. He noted that while the iPhone was great, it introduced a platform with a lot of arbitrary rules, and that the company hasn't invented anything great in a while. He also said that Apple's reasons for pushing back on letting other companies into its ecosystem are invalid - the security problems could be solved by building better security. Zuckerberg claims that Meta would double its profits if Apple stopped applying its random rules.

[### AGI Will Not Make Labor Worthless (8 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5Sq3XBcRmd8ereHgo/agi-will-not-make-labor-worthless?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Fears about human labor being replaced by machines go back hundreds, if not thousands, of years. These fears continue today with the rapid progress of AI in several previously secure human domains. The amount of intelligence competing in the average person's labor market has increased by several orders of magnitude over the past few centuries, but this did not turn low-skilled laborers into a permanently unemployed underclass - in fact, their incomes increased a lot as they specialized and traded with skilled workers. Human-level AGIs will still face constraints, forcing them to trade with humans for other services, just like skilled humans do.
