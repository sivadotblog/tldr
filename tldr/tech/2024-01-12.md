[### GitHub Actions as a time-sharing supercomputer (12 minute read)](https://blog.alexellis.io/github-actions-timesharing-supercomputer/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

GitHub Actions can be used for batch jobs. Developers can submit work to the service and receive the results later on asynchronously. actions-batch is a command-line tool that is essentially an API that turns GitHub Actions into a time-sharing computer. It creates new GitHub repositories, writes a workflow that runs 'job.sh' upon commits, and triggers jobs when a local bash file is written to the repository as 'job.sh'. actions-batch can be used for jobs like building kernels and running machine learning inference using Llama2.
