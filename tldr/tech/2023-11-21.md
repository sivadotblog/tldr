A new type of heat pump developed by materials scientists at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology in Belvaux uses electric fields and a special ceramic to warm or cool air. The technology combines a number of existing techniques and could be potentially competitive with heat pumps without the need for refrigerants in a smaller space.

[### A guide to LLM inference and performance (18 minute read)](https://www.baseten.co/blog/llm-transformer-inference-guide/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Using the full power of the GPU during LLM inference requires knowing if the inference is compute-bound or memory-bound. Calculating the operations per byte possible on a given GPU and comparing it to the arithmetic of a model's attention layers reveals where the bottleneck is. This information can be used to pick an appropriate GPU for model inference and use techniques like batching to better utilize GPU resources.

Spotify doesn't pay any commission fees when it uses its own payment processor on Android. It only pays a 4% fee when users choose to use Google as their payment processor. Google fought to keep the terms of its deal with Spotify secret during its antitrust trial as it could damage negotiations with other app developers who might want more generous fees. Spotify's unprecedented popularity was enough to justify a bespoke deal.
