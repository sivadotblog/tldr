[### Tesla Robotaxi reveal: What to expect (8 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/09/tesla-robotaxi-reveal-what-to-expect/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla plans to reveal its Robotaxi today at an event at Warner Bros. Discovery's movie studio in Burbank, California, starting at 7 pm. The vehicle will be a two-door, two-seater, Cybertruck-like compact vehicle likely without a steering wheel or pedals. Tesla may run into regulatory issues for the design - Elon Musk is expected to use this as a reason for why getting the vehicle to market will be difficult. The movie studio features large sound stages and sets. The environment is closed and controlled, with no other traffic, making it the perfect place for Tesla to demo its new technology.

[### DOJ indicates it's considering Google breakup following monopoly ruling (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/doj-indicates-its-considering-google-breakup-following-monopoly-ruling.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Department of Justice has indicated that it is considering behavioral and structural remedies as a result of its monopoly ruling against Google. The remedies could include contract requirements and prohibitions, non-discrimination product requirements, data and interoperability requirements, and structural requirements. They may include limiting or prohibiting default agreements and other revenue-sharing arrangements related to search and search-related products. The remedies are still far from being decided - Judge Amit Mehta says he'll aim to rule on the remedies by August 2025, and an appeal by Google will likely draw out any impact for potentially years.

Google has published a paper that identifies a phase transition in its quantum processor and uses it to identify conditions where the processor can operate with low noise. The paper shows that it would take a supercomputer a dozen years to simulate things even in those conditions. This article details the findings and their implications in more detail.

[### Zap Energy shows off its new fusion power prototype, Century (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/09/zap-energy-shows-off-its-new-fusion-power-prototype-century/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Zap Energy recently raised a $130 million Series D to build its Century device, an approach to fusion power that sends bolts of electricity through plasma streams instead of using magnets or lasers to squeeze the plasma. The current generates a magnetic field that compresses the plasma, which results in fusion. The final commercial-scale model, which should produce 50 megawatts of electricity, will occupy a footprint around the size of a double-decker bus. This article provides an overview of how Zap's technology works and the problems the company has to overcome before its technology becomes commercially viable.
