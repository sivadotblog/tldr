The universe is expanding about 8% faster than initially assumed possible. New measurements from the James Webb Space Telescope suggest that the long-established discrepancy between the observed expansion rate of the universe and the rate we thought possible based on our knowledge of the cosmos is potentially due to the influence of dark matter and dark energy. The discrepancy suggests that something is missing in our understanding of the early universe. The new data confirms that the universe is expanding faster today than it did during its first few billion years.
