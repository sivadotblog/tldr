[### Study Suggests That Pill Can Cut Hereditary Cancer Risk by 60 Percent (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/neoscope/study-pill-hereditary-cancer-risk-60-percent?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A double-blind longitudinal study of nearly 1,000 patients with a genetic condition that increases their individual risk of several cancers found that resistant starch has the ability to help prevent a range of cancers. Resistant starch resists acidic digestive bile, so it settles and ferments in the large intestine. This feeds gut-supporting friendly bacteria and may change the bacterial metabolism of bile acids, keeping them from damaging DNA.

Google has its own Linux desktop distribution called gLinux. The first version of the OS was called Goobuntu, based on Ubuntu. Google changed to a Debian-based OS in 2018 as upgrading the Ubuntu-based OS would take too long and cost too much. gLinux rolls out the latest updates and patches as they are created and deemed ready for production and changes can easily be rolled back if something goes wrong. The entire gLinux development team consists of a single on-duty release engineer that rotates among team members.
