[### Amazon reportedly used a secret algorithm to jack up prices (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/3/23901840/amazon-project-nessie-algorithm-antitrust-ftc-complaint?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon deployed a secret algorithm called Project Nessie to gauge how high it could raise prices before competitors stopped increasing their prices as well. The algorithm would inflate prices and monitor whether other retailers would follow suit. If retailers maintained the lower price, the algorithm would revert back to the normal price. Amazon reportedly stopped using it in 2019. Project Nessie is just one of the many ways the FTC has accused Amazon of illegally maintaining its market dominance in the e-commerce industry.

[### Introducing pgroll: zero-downtime, reversible, schema migrations for Postgres (7 minute read)](https://xata.io/blog/pgroll-schema-migrations-postgres?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Database schema migrations are essential for keeping systems up to date and in sync with evolving application requirements, but they come with many challenges. Many developers choose to avoid complex migrations due to this and only make additive changes, resulting in an accumulation of technical debt in the database schema. pgroll is a command-line tool for performing schema migrations against Postgres databases. It allows users to define schema migrations using a high-level JSON format and then takes care of executing them.
