[### ChatGPT and Other Chat Bots Are a ‚ÄòCode Red‚Äô for Google Search (8 minute read)](https://archive.ph/6HzCI#selection-537.193-541.135?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chat bots like ChatGPT have led Google's management to declare a 'code red'. Google already has a chat bot that could rival ChatGPT called LaMDA. Deploying a chat bot to answer queries could be an issue for Google as it would be much harder for the company to serve up ads in a chat format. Chat bots are also known to generate false, toxic, or biased information at times, so they are currently not able to be used reliably.

[### Kuo: Apple to Cancel or Postpone 2024 iPhone SE 4 (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/20/apple-to-cancel-or-postpone-iphone-se-4/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple will cancel or postpone mass production for the 2024 iPhone SE 4. The decision was made due to consistently lower than expected shipments of middle tier and lower-end devices. Apple's current design for the iPhone SE 4 will require higher costs and selling prices. The device was rumored to have an all-display design with a 6.1-inch screen and a notch at the top similar to the current iPhone 14 models.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Israeli scientists derive male and female cells from same person for first time (6 minute read)](https://www.jpost.com/science/article-723622?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at Jerusalem‚Äôs Hadassah University Medical Center have created human male and female cells with the same genetic code from the same person. There are no genetically identical twins in nature where one is a male and the other is a female. The technique creates stem cells that only differ in sex chromosomes. It could lead to new discoveries in the study of sex differences.

[### Artificial intelligence and the rise of optical computing (9 minute read)](https://archive.ph/DrD0n#selection-593.0-593.57?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Optical computers can do many calculations at the same time while using less power than traditional computers. Analog optical computers excel at linear algebra, making them ideal for machine learning applications. The technology to make optical neural networks is now commercially viable. This could enable low power devices to perform deep-learning operations without having to transfer potentially sensitive data elsewhere.

[### Cadl (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/cadl?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cadl is a language for describing cloud service APIs. It can generate other API description languages, client and server code, documentation, and other assets. Cadl can describe API shapes common among REST, OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC, and other protocols. It promotes API designs that adhere to best practices.

[### Custom Diffusion (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/adobe-research/custom-diffusion?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Custom Diffusion allows users to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models using a few images of a new concept. It can merge two fine-tuned models using optimization. Custom Diffusion is fast as it only fine-tunes a subset of model parameters. Examples of images produced with Custom Diffusion are available.

[### ChatGPT is closing out 2022 with a bang, but what‚Äôs next? (5 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/RamaswmySridhar/status/1605603043046674435)

OpenAI is set to release GPT-4 in early 2023. The company will not publish a paper about the model. This Twitter thread makes predictions about what the model will be capable of. GPT-4 will be trained on more dialogue data, proprietary signals from Bing's index, and feedback data from ChatGPT. Users should expect longer context windows and the model should be more helpful and have less harmful outputs.

[### Elon Musk blames Twitter cost cuts on ‚Äú$3 billion negative cash flow‚Äù (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/elon-musk-blames-twitter-cost-cuts-on-3-billion-negative-cash-flow/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk claims that Twitter would have faced a negative cash flow situation of $3 billion a year if he had not implemented cost-cutting efforts. Twitter was on course to spend $5 billion in 2023, but it is only on track to make about $3 billion in revenue. Musk says the changes he made will help the company roughly hit cash flow break-even. He will step down as Twitter CEO as soon as a replacement is found.
