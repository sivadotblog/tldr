Manual testing on personal devices is too slow and too limited. It forces teams to cut releases a week early just to test before submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage, issues slip through.

[### Waymo ramps up robotaxi production at new Arizona factory (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/waymo-ramps-up-robotaxi-production-at-new-arizona-factory/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Waymo currently has more than 1,500 commercial robotaxis in operation. It is working with Magna to build more than 2,000 autonomous I-Pace vehicles at a new factory in Arizona. The factory is strategically located in one of Waymo's robotaxi markets and close to its other service areas. Vehicles will be able to pick up their first public passengers less than 30 minutes after leaving the factory. The plant will be capable of building tens of thousands of fully autonomous Waymo vehicles per year when operating at full capacity.

[### Microsoft Is Key Holdout for OpenAI Restructuring Plan (3 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/microsoft-said-to-be-key-holdout-for-openai-restructuring-plan?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NjQ5MzM1MSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ3MDk4MTUxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVlQxSTJEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.C_FgUAAUnYuOjFkOcQZwaEz1FKVx5IQRA2YGJTvw20I&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft has still not yet approved OpenAI's plans for restructuring. The conversion will also need the approval of the state attorneys general of California and Delaware. Microsoft wants to make sure that any changes to OpenAI's structure adequately protects its investment. It is still actively negotiating the details of OpenAI's proposal. OpenAI will move forward with the effort to restructure its for-profit division as a public benefit corporation, but the overall business will remain under the control of its nonprofit.

[### Uber and WeRide set their robotaxi sights on 15 more cities (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/uber-and-weride-set-their-robotaxi-sights-on-15-more-cities/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Uber and Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide plan to bring robotaxi services to another 15 cities over the next five years. The expansion will focus on cities outside of China and the United States and include cities in Europe. Uber has more than 15 partnerships with a wide range of autonomous vehicle technology companies, the highest-profile of which is with Waymo. Uber and Waymo will soon launch a robotaxi service in Atlanta.

[### Amateur Athletes Are Turning to Ozempic to Raise Their Game (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/ozempic-amateur-athletes-3fc9e0bf?st=YAmZu1&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many athletes are taking GLP-1 weight-loss drugs to gain a performance edge. The practice has caught the attention of the World Anti-Doping Agency. If the organization finds that semaglutide enhances performance, poses a health risk, or violates 'the spirit of the sport', it could end up on its banned list. However, making that determination is complex, and the drug's effects could have different outcomes depending on the sport.

[### Google accidentally reveals Android's Material 3 Expressive interface ahead of I/O (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-accidentally-reveals-androids-material-3-expressive-interface-ahead-of-i-o/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google's next version of Android might look quite different. The company recently published and quickly removed a blog post that detailed 'Material 3 Expressive', a redesign expected to be revealed at I/O later this month. While the original Material Design did a good job of leveraging colors and consistent theming, it made apps look too similar. The new interface appears much more varied. Screenshots from the deleted blog post are available in the article.

[### An Interview with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg About AI and the Evolution of Social Media (68 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-about-ai-and-the-evolution-of-social-media/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This is a transcript of an interview with Mark Zuckerberg where he discusses the broader themes that place Llama in Meta's historical context. The interview covers Meta's platform ambitions over the last two decades, the evolution of social networking, and how Zuckerberg has changed his thinking about both. Zuckerberg talks about the Llama API and the tension between GPU opportunity cost and leveraging training costs, and why he thinks that the latter is worth paying for. He also discusses why Meta AI may actually bring many of his oldest ideas full circle, how that ties into Reality Labs, and why Meta ended up being the perfect name for the company.

[### I'd rather read the prompt (12 minute read)](https://claytonwramsey.com/blog/prompt/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

People shouldn't let computers write for them. Their original thoughts are far more interesting, meaningful, and valuable than whatever a large language model can transform them into. Writing should be a medium for communicating original thoughts - if it's not worth writing, it's not worth reading. Language models are great for making nonsense and not so great for anything else - it's probably better to just read the prompt.
