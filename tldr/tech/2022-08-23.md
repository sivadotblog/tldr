Instagram is testing a new feature called IG Candid that lets users share content at a different time each day after receiving a prompt. It is very similar to BeReal's selfie sharing feature.

Just like BeReal, the IG Candid feature requires users to respond to prompts within 2 minutes of receiving a notification.

[### Electrical currents to the brain improve memory for older adults, study finds (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/23316230/brain-stimulation-memory-short-long-alzheimers?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A research team used a swim cap-like device studded with electrodes to deliver electric currents to specific parts of the brain to improve memory in older adults. Those who had the worst cognitive abilities had the biggest improvements and the effects lasted for over a month. The electrical stimulation likely helped improve the brain's growth and change in areas important for memory. The scientists plan to test the device on people with Alzheimer's disease and other conditions that affect cognitive functioning.
