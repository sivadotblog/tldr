### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists hack fly brains to make them remote controlled (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/science/fly-brains-hack-remote-controlled/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have hacked the brains of fruit flies to make them remote-controlled. The flies were genetically engineered so that they expressed a certain heat-sensitive ion channel in some of their neurons that would be activated when it sensed heat, causing the flies to spread their wings. They then injected iron oxide nanoparticles into the insects' brains. The nanoparticles heated up when a magnetic field switched on nearby, which caused the neurons to fire and the flies to spread their wings. The goal of the research was to use this kind of technology to restore some sight to patients with vision impairments by stimulating the visual cortex.
