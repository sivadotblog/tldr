[### Tesla releases official API documentation to support third-party apps (4 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2023/10/12/tesla-releases-official-api-documentation-support-third-party-apps/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla has officially released API documentation to support third-party apps after years of operating with an unofficial API. The API is still geared toward fleet management, but it could be the first step in creating a healthy app ecosystem. All third-party apps will have to go through Tesla's new API starting next year. The introduction of an official API was likely related to Tesla's recent release of in-car fleet management and rental software with Hertz.

[### Woman's Experimental Bionic Hand Passes Major Test With Flying Colors (6 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/bionic-mia-hand-prosthetic-amputee-phantom-pain-1850919751?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A recently published paper details the case of a Swedish woman who has successfully worn an advanced bionic limb for years with no major issues. The woman had suffered a farming injury that took much of her right arm below the elbow, leaving her with phantom limb pain that required high doses of medication to manage. The bionic limb is directly connected to the woman's neuromusculoskeletal system. It is controlled by her nervous system and provides sensory feedback. The limb substantially reduced the woman's phantom limb pain and need for medication. A video of the bionic limb is available.

[### On Importance of Naming in Programming (12 minute read)](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2023/10/12/on-importance-of-naming-in-programming?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Good naming results in cleaner code and improved architecture. Almost all of writing clean code is just naming things correctly. Bad names are usually an indicator of problematic code - a failure in design. A good name doesn't misdirect, omit, or assume. It gives developers a good idea about what the variable contains or function does. This article emphasizes the importance of naming in programming by providing examples of good names and bad names and explaining the consequences of bad naming. It provides tips on how to come up with good names.

[### Why aren't there more 80% jobs? (4 minute read)](https://evertpot.com/on-80-percent-jobs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Some jobs are starting to move to 4-day workweeks, but there hasn't been any increase in the number of 80% jobs - 32 hour jobs at 80% salary. These types of jobs would be a low-risk proposition that many people in tech would likely take if it were an option. 80% jobs offer many benefits for both employers and employees, even though they may cost more in terms of overhead. Another option is to offer 90% jobs, giving workers an extra day off every two weeks.
