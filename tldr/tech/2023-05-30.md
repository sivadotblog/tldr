[### Watch this Nvidia demo and imagine actually speaking to AI game characters (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/28/23740908/nvidia-ace-demo-voice-ai-npc-game-characters?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia demoed a new generative AI technology at Computex 2023 that allows people to talk to game characters with their own voice. The Nvidia Avatar Cloud Engine used to create the feature will run both locally and in the cloud. It will include tools for deploying large language models, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and other bits. A video demonstrating the technology is available in the article.

[### The future of TikTok bans (5 minute read)](https://archive.ph/Y4LIJ?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Montana's new TikTok ban will see app stores fined $10,000 per day if they make TikTok available to users in Montana after January 1. TikTok has filed a lawsuit against Montana citing Constitutional grounds. Proposed TikTok bans are cropping up all over the US and there is the possibility of a national ban. Current laws look to cut off access to the app at the point of download, so people will likely still be able to keep what's already on their phones. It will be difficult to enforce these new laws.

[### Japan will try to beam solar power from space by 2025 (1 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/japan-will-try-to-beam-solar-power-from-space-by-2025-214338244.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A Japanese public-private partnership will attempt to beam solar energy from space as early as 2025. The project involves deploying a series of small satellites in orbit and beaming the solar energy the arrays collect to ground-based receiving stations hundreds of miles away. Space solar panels can collect energy 24/7 and clouds will no longer be a concern. Several countries are pursuing the idea. The technology is still very expensive.

[### Email addresses are not primary user identities (6 minute read)](https://ntietz.com/blog/email-address-not-identifier/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Software isn't built to handle changing email addresses. The process for keeping an account but changing email addresses can be complicated for many services. Systems that decouple identity from attributes and login methods are able to create a better user experience for updating attributes like email addresses. It makes it easier to migrate domains and have multiple login methods. Systems should stop assuming that names and email addresses don't change.
