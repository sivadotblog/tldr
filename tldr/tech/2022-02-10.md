[### European project sets a record for fusion energy produced by a tokamak (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/european-project-sets-a-record-for-fusion-energy-produced-by-a-tokamak/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Joint European Torus (JET) has set a new record for released energy, releasing 59 megajoules of energy over five seconds. It is still well short of the break-even point where the fusion energy released matches the energy input required to trigger the fusion. The results are still an important validation of the approach being taken at the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). JET is being used as a testbed for the technologies and materials that will go into ITER. ITER is expected to begin experimental runs in 2025.

[### A geomagnetic storm may have effectively destroyed 40 SpaceX Starlink satellites (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22924561/spacex-starlink-satellites-geomagnetic-storm?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

40 of the 49 Starlink satellites launched on February 3 will be destroyed due to a geomagnetic storm that caused up to 50% higher drag than during previous launches. Starlink tried to save the satellites by flying them edge-on to reduce drag but it was unsuccessful. The satellites will burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Starlink has now launched over 2,000 satellites and plans to launch up to 12,000. A statement from Starlink explaining the incident is available in the article.

[### Reselling gig work is TikTok‚Äôs newest side hustle (8 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/22905356/gig-work-drop-shipping-fiverr-tiktok?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Drop servicing is where someone resells specialized services, for example, video editing, writing, or custom art. It recently became popular on TikTok as a profitable business model with low effort required. Many drop service providers use platforms like Fiverr to find freelance workers as it is very competitive with price. This article gives an insider's look at what it is like to run a drop servicing business. While drop servicing is sold as a get-rich-quick life hack, being the middle manager isn't easy, and it can be frustrating for the freelancers involved.

[### Intel‚Äôs strategy for outflanking Arm takes shape with bet on RISC-V (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/02/intels-strategy-for-outflanking-arm-takes-shape-with-bet-on-risc-v/?comments=1?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Intel has announced a $1 billion innovation fund that will bet on a couple of key technologies, including RISC-V, an open-source instruction set that shows promise in low-power and embedded systems. Arm may have the smartphone market, but simple, small, and low-power chips will be needed in everything from cars to smart light bulbs. RISC-V supplier Andes Technology shipped more than 3 billion RISC-V chips in the last year. Nvidia recently announced its intention to purchase Arm, but the sale was blocked by regulators. Arm may be in the process of filing for an IPO.
