[### Hypersonic space cannon promises 10 minutes from ground to orbit (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/space/greenlaunch-space-cannon-gas-launch/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Green Launch is a company that wants to launch satellites into space using a huge gas cannon. A hydrogen impulse launcher is a long tube filled with hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. When it is fired, the gasses expand extremely quickly, launching projectiles at incredibly high speeds. Rockets launched by Green Launch's system won't need to carry as much fuel, but they will need a second stage rocket to steer into the correct orbit. The system would be able to send rockets into space every 60 to 90 minutes. Videos of the launcher being fired are available.
