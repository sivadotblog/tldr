[### Twitter is launching a Tor service for more secure and private tweeting (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22967843/twitter-tor-onion-service-version-launch?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Twitter has launched a Tor version of its site. Tor is a privacy-protecting and censorship-evading network. Tor sites, also known as 'onion' sites, can only be accessed while using Tor Browser or a similar tool. Twitter‚Äôs onion site will provide more layers of protection over accessing the ordinary website through Tor. Creating a Tor service will help fix functionality issues for Tor users, who are frequently incorrectly flagged as botnets. A link to Twitter's Tor service is available in the article.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Anti-viral drugs can successfully make old human eggs young again (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/anti-viral-eggs-young?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Women are born with all the eggs they will ever have, and the quality of chromosomes and DNA within each egg declines with age, resulting in less chance of pregnancy with older age. A team of researchers from Israel have shown that treating mouse eggs with an antiviral medicine can reverse the age of older eggs. The reverse-aged eggs haven't been tested yet against fertilization, but they may provide hope for women over 40 who want to be mothers. The researchers hope that the technology will be available for human use within the next 10 years.

[### Tiny, Solid-State Lidar Raises Stakes in the Megapixel Race (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/solid-state-lidar?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team of engineers at the University of California, Berkeley, have created a solid-state LIDAR with 16,384 pixels integrated onto a 110-square-millimeter silicon photonic chip. It can cover a field of view of around 70 degrees at a range of 10 meters with a resolution of 1.7 centimeters. The engineers have plans for improving the sensor's performance. The device can be mass-produced using standard semiconductor processes in commercial CMOS foundries. High-resolution LIDAR will allow for better self-navigating cars and drones, more accurate 3D map generation, mobile 3D sensing for augmented reality, and more.
