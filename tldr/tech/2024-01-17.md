### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Experimental ultrasound treatment targeting brains in trials to help those with Alzheimer's, drug addiction (5 minute read)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ultrasound-treatment-alzheimers-drug-addiction-patients-60-minutes/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new experimental treatment uses ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier using a specialized helmet to temporarily allow therapeutic drugs to quickly get inside the brain. Patients are awake during the procedure but they say the procedure is painless. In human trials, the treatment resulted in a clear reduction in the beta-amyloid proteins targeted. The treatment has also shown efficacy in treating patients with severe drug addictions.

[### A Cloned Rhesus Monkey Is Still Alive After 2 Years (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/a-cloned-rhesus-monkey-is-still-alive-after-2-years?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team of researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences claims one of its cloned monkeys has lived more than two years, the longest any cloned rhesus macaque has survived yet. It was developed using a new method called the trophoblast replacement method. The new technique could have implications for conventional IVF. There is still a lot of trial and error involved - the researchers achieved just one live fetus for every 113 activated embryos, and of all 11 embryos transferred to a womb, only one produced a live fetus.
