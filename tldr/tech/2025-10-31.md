[### How to Fix the #1 Problem with Vibe Coding (Sponsor)](http://xano.com/go?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=tldr_vibe_coding)

Vibe coding makes building fast‚Äîbut hides what's really happening. All of the logic, architecture, and security live in hundreds of lines of code. Even to a trained engineer, the sheer volume can make it impractical to parse.

Vibe code without the black box.

Xano lets you build with AI and see your entire backend logic visually, so you can ship faster and stay in control.

No black boxes. Just visibility, flexibility, and a production-ready backend that powers any app.

Xano gives you everything you need‚Äîlogic, data, server, and auth‚Äîand works with any frontend, including projects built with Lovable, WeWeb, and more.

[### Tim Cook says more AIs are coming to Apple Intelligence (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/news/810735/tim-cook-ai-apple-intelligence-integrations?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple plans to embed more third-party AI tools into its operating systems. The company is on track to release an AI-upgraded Siri next year. It is open to pursuing mergers and acquisitions if it thinks it will advance its roadmap. The company recently released fourth quarter earnings results that showed it raked in a record $102.5 billion over the past few months, an 8% increase compared to the same period last year.

[### Android 17 Will Put Full-Screen Apps on Your Always-On Display (3 minute read)](https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/10/android-17-always-on-display-aod-full-screen-apps-min-mode.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google plans to add a new capability called Min Mode to Android's Always-On Display (AOD) in Android 17. Min Mode will use the same low-power technology as AOD to display full-screen interfaces from apps. Developers must register a 'MinModeActivity' component in their apps for them to work with the feature. Min Mode has the potential to reshape the definition of an 'idle' phone.

[### World's first underwater habitat in decades to unlock secrets of 95% of oceans (5 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/worlds-first-underwater-habitat?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

DEEP, a UK-based subsea engineering firm, has unveiled a prototype of an underwater habitat designed to allow scientists to live and carry out research beneath the sea's surface for days at a time. The Vanguard pilot human habitat is part of an ambitious effort to make long-term underwater living possible. The prototype can support up to four crew members for up to a week. Currently, most expeditions can only allow scientists to stay submerged for a few hours at a time.

[### SpaceX and Blue Origin both submitted plans to get astronauts back to the moon faster, NASA says (4 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/spacex-and-blue-origin-both-submitted-plans-to-get-astronauts-back-to-the-moon-sooner.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX has pitched NASA a 'simplified mission' to put astronauts back on the moon following criticisms over delays. The company is behind schedule on building its lunar landing system for NASA's Artemis III mission, which caused NASA to reopen the landing contract for the mission. Blue Origin also submitted a plan. It has been developing a lunar lander for NASA and plans to launch a smaller-scale version of it, known as the Blue Moon Mark 1.

AI is making it easier to create personalized app experiences. The ML Kit GenAI Prompt API for Android enables developers to send natural language and multimodal requests to Gemini Nano to support custom, app-specific GenAI use cases. It allows developers to create unique features with complex data transformation. The API uses Gemini Nano on-device to process data locally, enabling offline capability and improved user privacy.

[### Scale design decisions across teams and products (Website)](https://www.designtokens.org/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Design Tokens W3C Community Group (DTCG) is a community of designers, developers, and tooling vendors that aims to standardize how design tokens are defined and exchanged. It stewards the Design Tokens specification so that teams can share visual language reliability across design tools, code bases, and platforms. The first stable version of the DTCG JSON format is now available. The format unlocks interoperability and theming between tools.

[### Taking Money off the Table (7 minute read)](https://zachholman.com/posts/money-off-the-table?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Employees who get compensated with shares sometimes have the opportunity to sell a portion of them, but it can be difficult to choose whether to sell or to roll the dice and risk it longer. They should take the money while it's available. The amount will likely be a life-changing amount of money, and there's never a guarantee that their startup will succeed, even if it is looking good right now. The money you take today can be invested in more steady growth.

[### Humans Need Entropy (4 minute read)](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/humans-need-entropy?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

As people get older, they tend to repeat the same patterns. The solution to preventing this is to find sources of entropy. When we were kids, everything was entropy because everything was new. As adults, we need to constantly seek out the new to maximize the entropy in our lives.
