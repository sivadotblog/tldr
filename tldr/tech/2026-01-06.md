[### When AWS Grew Wings: The “Boring” Genius of Amazon Leo (5 minute read)](https://news.satnews.com/2026/01/02/when-aws-grew-wings-the-boring-genius-of-amazon-leo/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon Leo, formerly known as Project Kuiper, will launch in the first quarter of this year with a three-tier hardware strategy that will first target the US, UK, Germany, France, and Canada. Customers will be able to choose between three terminals: Leo Nano, which is capable of delivering 100 Mbps; Leo Pro, a standard unit that can push 400 Mbps; and Leo Ultra, an enterprise terminal capable of 1 Gbps. The smaller terminals will help the service scale, while the Ultra terminal signals to traditional broadband providers that Amazon plans to support them rather than bypass them.

[### Finger-Prick Blood Test Could Offer Easier Way to Detect Alzheimer's, Researchers Say (4 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-05/alzheimer-s-detection-may-get-easier-with-simple-finger-prick-blood-test?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NzY3OTg1NiwiZXhwIjoxNzY4Mjg0NjU2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUODNYR05UOTZPU1MwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMzZENUE5QzIxMDQ0NjU4OTFBMTc1MTVDRDNBQkZFNiJ9.es9p7RvcPDdUBwQKNu5Gcs8B8YC2bbCE1eFzGXTOK5Q&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Dried blood analysis could be a feasible and scalable way to detect the brain changes linked to Alzheimer's. Researchers have developed a dried blood test that, while less accurate than traditional blood tests, showed good ability to distinguish people with Alzheimer's-related disease. The method is cheaper than traditional testing and could potentially be performed outside of clinical settings. The same technique could potentially be used to detect other conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

[### The importance of Agent Harness in 2026 (6 minute read)](https://www.philschmid.de/agent-harness-2026?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An Agent Harness is the infrastructure that wraps around an AI model to manage long-running tasks. It is the system that governs how the agent operates. Agent harnesses turn vague, multistep agent workflows into structured data that can be logged and graded to improve systems. They can be used to validate real-world progress, empower the user experience, and improve models via real-world feedback.
