Researchers from Link√∂ping, Lund, and Gothenburg universities in Sweden have successfully grown electrodes in living tissue by using the body's molecules as triggers. They developed a gel composed of enzymes that could be used to grow electrodes in the body. The injected gel and electrode formation did not affect the animals. This method could potentially create nerve stimulation interfaces and pave the way for forming fully integrated electronic circuits in living organisms.

[### Tech Layoffs Are Feeding a New Startup Surge (4 minute read)](https://archive.ph/WE4WH?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The tech industry has seen a significant decrease in the number of employees in the past two years, with at least 260,000 workers laid off. Many of these individuals have decided to become entrepreneurs, taking advantage of their severance packages to pursue their own business ventures.

Early indications show that this trend of laid-off workers becoming entrepreneurs is on the rise.

This article discusses the current job market and how it compares to the Dotcom Bust and the financial crisis in 2008. The current downturn is far worse than in 2008 but not nearly as bad as in the Dotcom Bust. It is fundamentally different from the Dotcom Bust as many companies and venture capital firms still have a lot of money, they're just not investing right now. While there is a current downturn in hiring, it appears that no one is panicking and many are crafting a plan for the next few years.
