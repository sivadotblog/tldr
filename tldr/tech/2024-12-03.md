[### 12-pound US robot balloons capture NYC-sized areas in jaw-dropping details (4 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/robot-balloons-capture-nyc-sized-areas?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Near Space Labs has launched a fleet of balloon robots to monitor and assess disaster-prone areas in the US. The balloons carry AI-powered robots called Swifts. These robots form a network to capture detailed aerial images. The image resolution is expected to rival or exceed traditional aerial surveys conducted by planes or helicopters at lower altitudes. They will be able to map large disaster zones in detail within hours rather than weeks and help insurance companies, urban planners, and government agencies assess properties and perform risk evaluations.

[### Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/02/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-loses-bid-to-get-56-billion-pay-package-reinstated.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A Delaware judge has upheld the ruling that Elon Musk's 2018 CEO pay package of $56 billion was improperly granted. The ruling said that Musk had individually controlled Tesla and dictated the terms of his compensation to a board that didn't fairly negotiate. A $345 million attorney fee award was approved for the lawyers who successfully sued on behalf of Tesla shareholders. Despite the legal setback, Musk has seen his net worth jump considerably in recent weeks - he is more than $43 billion richer since the election.
