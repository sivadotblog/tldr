[### Microsoft Strung Together Tens of Thousands of Chips in a Pricey Supercomputer for OpenAI (6 minute read)](https://archive.ph/Yg4iu)

Microsoft's billion-dollar investment in OpenAI in 2019 was accompanied by a commitment to construct a cutting-edge supercomputer for the AI research start-up. To create the new technology, Microsoft had to find ways to combine tens of thousands of Nvidia's A100 graphics chips and reposition server racks to avoid power outages. Microsoft now uses the supercomputer it created for OpenAI to train and run its own large AI models while also selling it to other customers. The company is now working on the next generation of its AI supercomputer.

[### Ultrathin Metasurface Displays Take Aim at the LCD (9 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/metasurface-displays?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have developed a new kind of metasurface display roughly 1/100 the thickness of the average human hair that could offer 10 times the resolution and consume half as much energy as LCD screens. A display made with the technology could offer over 1,000 frames per second. The metasurface could replace the liquid crystal layer in LCD displays. Displays made with the metasurface don't require polarizers, which are responsible for half of the wasted light intensity and energy use in LCD displays. The metasurface is stable and does not degrade over time.

This article details the events that occurred during the last few months leading up to Silicon Valley Bank's collapse. Bank runs can have devastating effects on banks, as they may not have enough assets to pay out to all depositors. This can cause more depositors to start withdrawing their funds, making matters worse. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures accounts to avoid bank runs by ensuring that depositors don't lose their money. Silicon Valley Bank had been technically insolvent due to unliquidated assets, but it was expected that they would eventually become liquid and pay their full value.

First Republic Bank shares experienced a significant decline in early trades, leading to trades of the bank being paused, despite government activity over the weekend to address the Silicon Valley Bank crisis and potential contagion. The bank tried to address investor concerns by announcing that it had raised its financial position through additional liquidity from the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase. First Republic Bank possesses more than $70 billion in unused liquidity to support its operations. Other regional banks were also impacted by a trading hit.
