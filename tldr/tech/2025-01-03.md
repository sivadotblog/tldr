[### Meet the Anthrobots: a new living entity with much to teach us (17 minute read)](https://thoughtforms.life/meet-the-anthrobots-a-new-living-entity-with-much-to-teach-us/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthrobots are synthetic biological proto-organisms made of living cells with un-edited genomes. They could have many future uses in the human body, including laying down pro-regenerative molecules, clearing plaque from arteries, healing spinal cord or retinal damage, dealing with cancer cells or bacteria in the gut, or informing doctors of the status of the surrounding tissues. Anthrobots do not exponentially reproduce and just biodegrade at the end of their lifespan. Scientists are still experimenting with these lifeforms to get a true idea of their capabilities in various problem spaces.

[### Next-gen Wi-Fi to trade ludicrous speed for the boring art of actually working (7 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/02/wifi_8_feature/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Wi-Fi 8 looks to be focused on greater reliability rather than on pushing bandwidth even higher. It will make the speed gains promised by Wi-Fi 7 more of a reality. End users will not see the full benefits until they have upgraded both their access points and endpoint devices to the new standard. The first devices with Wi-Fi 8 are not expected to roll out until the second half of 2028.

[### Ask HN: Where to Work After 40? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42573875&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Heaps of companies want employees with long-term experience. Many of these companies aren't attractive to younger workers and would be glad to hire someone with experience. Experienced workers can also enter into consulting/professional services, which provides a varied and interesting work environment. The expiry date for a software engineer is definitely much later than 40 - many are still working late into their 50s and 60s.

[### I still don't think companies serve you ads based on spying through your microphone (4 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/2/they-spy-on-you-but-not-like-that/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many people are convinced that companies are targeting ads to them by listening through their phone's microphones. For this to be true, companies would have to record audio snippets, transmit them back to their servers for additional processing, and then feed that data into a system that forwards it to advertising partners. This is far-fetched, especially for companies like Apple, which has a brand and reputation as a privacy-first company and spends large amounts on product design and engineering to prevent apps from doing exactly this kind of thing. The more likely scenario is that the quality of targeting is high and that people just aren't that different from each other.
