[### This Next-Generation Display Technology Is Going to Change the World (7 minute read)](https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/this-next-generation-display-technology-is-going-to-change-the-world/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Electroluminescent quantum dots are more advanced than the quantum dots found in the TVs of today and could potentially replace LCD and OLED for phones and TVs. They are theoretically simple to produce and have the potential to enhance image quality, reduce energy consumption, and increase manufacturing efficiency. Nanosys recently demoed a prototype of its next-generation QD device at CES 2023. This article discusses QD displays, their history, and how they are set to change the world.

[### Scientists steer lightning bolts with lasers for the first time (3 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/16/scientists-steer-lightning-bolts-with-lasers-for-the-first-time?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists successfully steered lightning bolts with lasers last year during heavy storms on top of a Swiss mountain. The feat involved firing powerful laser pulses at thunderclouds for more than six hours. By changing the refractive index of air and ionizing the air molecules around them, the lasers created an easier path for electrical discharge to flow down. The technology could lead to laser-based lightning protection systems at airports, launchpads, and tall buildings.

[### How Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA Monopoly In Machine Learning Is Breaking - OpenAI Triton And PyTorch 2.0 (24 minute read)](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/nvidiaopenaitritonpytorch?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The default software stack for machine learning models is moving away from Nvidia's closed-source CUDA. Nvidia let OpenAI and Meta take control of the software stack, permanently weakening its moat. PyTorch is the preferred framework in the industry due to its increased flexibility and usability versus TensorFlow. This article looks at why TensorFlow lost to PyTorch, why Google hasn't been able to capitalize on its first-mover advantage in AI, why Nvidia is so dominant in the industry, how its competitive advantage is being wiped away, and more.
