[### Scientists invent biomaterial that can heal tissue from the inside out (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/scientists-invent-biomaterial-healing-tissue?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at the University of California San Diego have developed a new biomaterial that could potentially aid in repairing tissue damage caused by heart attacks and other ailments. The new material can reduce inflammation and repair cells in instances of traumatic brain injury and pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as tissue damage caused by heart attacks. Unlike other treatments, the biomaterial can be administered via intravenous injection immediately after a heart attack and can distribute evenly throughout an affected area, allowing for more efficient repair. Human safety and efficacy studies are expected to begin within two years.
