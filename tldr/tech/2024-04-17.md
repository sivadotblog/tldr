[### New charging algorithm could double life of li-ion batteries (3 minute read)](https://www.techspot.com/news/102635-new-charging-algorithm-could-double-life-li-ion.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team of researchers from Berlin has developed a charging solution that makes lithium-ion batteries last much longer than they do now. It uses a pulsed current (PC) protocol that results in reduced mechanical stress and cracking in graphite particles within batteries and suppressed structural degradation in cathodes. Using PC charging can double the service life of commercial lithium-ion batteries with an 80% capacity retention. High-frequency pulsing with square-wave current produced the best results.

[### A quick post on Chen's algorithm (4 minute read)](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2024/04/16/a-quick-post-on-chens-algorithm/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A recent paper authored by Yilei Chen called 'Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems' has roiled the cryptography research community. The preprint, whose results are still being evaluated, claims a new quantum algorithm that efficiently solves the 'shortest independent vector problem' in lattices with specific parameters. If true, the result could allow future quantum computers to break schemes that depend on the hardness of specific instances of these problems. If the result can be improved upon, it could render an entire generation of 'post-quantum' lattice-based schemes obsolete, forcing cryptographers and the industry back to the drawing board.
