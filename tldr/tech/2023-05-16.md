The ocean is an important potential source of renewable energy. The Biden administration's Ocean Climate Action Plan recognizes the potential of offshore wind power and less-developed resources like waves, tides, and currents. Even colder waters deep below tropical seas could provide clean marine energy. Offshore wind could generate enough power to make a real dent in carbon emissions. This article discusses several ocean-based renewable energy projects.

[### Chinese scientists develop cutting-edge tech for 3D ceramic printing in the air to create complex engineering parts (3 minute read)](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3220513/chinese-scientists-develop-cutting-edge-tech-3d-ceramic-printing-air-create-complex-engineering?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese scientists have developed a revolutionary 3D printing technique for ceramics that can generate ceramic parts without the need for supportive structures. The new method enables the creation of shapes previously impossible with traditional 3D printing techniques. It can print at almost any angle. The process results in the instant solidification of multi-scale filaments ranging in diameters from 0.41mm to 3.5mm, allowing the construction of structures like torsion springs and cantilevers. It can blend ceramics with different properties by using additives.
