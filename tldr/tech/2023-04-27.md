[### New nanoparticles can perform gene editing in the lungs (5 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-nanoparticles-can-perform-gene-editing-lungs-0330?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Engineers at MIT and the University of Massachusetts Medical School have developed a new type of nanoparticle that can deliver encoding messenger RNA in lungs. Injected nanoparticles usually accumulate in the liver. The team created a new lipid nanoparticle that can target cells in the lung that are of interest for lung diseases. Further development of the technology could result in inhalable treatments for cystic fibrosis and other lung diseases.

DeepFloyd IF is a modular model designed to generate high-quality images from text prompts. The base model creates 64x64 pixel images, while two super-resolution models create 256x256 px and 1024x1024 px versions of the image. DeepFloyd IF achieves a zero-shot FID score of 6.66 on the COCO dataset, outperforming current state-of-the-art models. Examples of images generated by DeepFloyd IF are available in the repository.

[### Why does did Google Brain exist? (11 minute read)](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/why_brain/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google Brain and DeepMind merged into 'Google DeepMind' last week, killing the Brain brand. Google Brain hosted a lot of research projects, many seemingly just for research's sake, but some of it has resulted in breakthrough technologies like TensorFlow, TPUs, JAX, and Transformers. Its bottom-up, research culture contributed strongly to these breakthroughs. The DeepMind merger will likely result in project cancellations, mergers, and reallocations of headcounts. There will probably be clashes between DeepMind's top-down culture with Brain's bottom-up culture.
