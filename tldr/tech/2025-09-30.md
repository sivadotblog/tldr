OpenAI's new 'Instant Checkout' feature, which allows ChatGPT users to make Etsy and Shopify purchases within conversations, is now available in the US to ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Free logged-in users. Users can now just tap a 'Buy' button to confirm their order, shipping, and payment details to complete a purchase. OpenAI says that the product results it surfaces are organic and unsponsored and ranked purely on relevance to the user. Merchants will be charged a fee for completed purchases.

OpenAI is preparing to release a standalone social app powered by its Sora 2 video model. The app will reportedly closely resemble TikTok but only feature AI-generated content. There will be no option for users to upload photos or videos. Users will be limited to generating 10-second-long clips. They will be able to create videos using their likeness - and receive a notification whenever their likeness is used by someone else. The app will refuse to generate some videos due to copyright restrictions.

[### China's oyster-inspired ‚Äòbone glue' bonds fractures, can replace metal in surgery (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/chinas-oyster-inspired-bone-glue?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Bone-02 is a new kind of medical adhesive created by a team of Chinese researchers. It is designed to repair broken bones quickly without the need for metal plates, screws, or big surgeries. The glue can be injected directly into a fracture site to help speed up bone repair, bonding bone fragments together in two to three minutes, even in blood-rich areas. The researchers were inspired by oysters, which have a remarkable ability to attach to hard surfaces in harsh environments. This is due to a special protein-rich adhesive that works in wet, salty, and constantly moving conditions, forming a tough bond that resists both pressure and erosion.

[### 6,100-Qubit Processor Shatters Quantum Computing Record (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/6100-qubit-processor-shatters-quantum-computing-record?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Physicists from the California Institute of Technology have built a quantum computing array containing 6,100 qubits, well above the thousand or so qubits previous systems contain. They used cesium atoms as their qubits, trapping them in place with a complex system of lasers that act as tweezers to keep the atoms as stable as possible. Large arrays allow for better error correction, which helps to overcome the inherent fragility of qubits by providing a surplus to double-check machine operations.

[### Fork yeah: Valkey 9 sharpens edge against Redis (3 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/29/valkey_9/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Valkey, which was forked from Redis in April last year, is set to release its ninth iteration next month. The update promises improved resource optimization and availability. It will allow multiple logical databases in cluster mode, enabling developers to combine many different applications using the same cluster. Valkey 9 also promises unified auto-failover configuration for high availability, regardless of deployment choices, so clusters stay consistent from development to staging to production. It has a safe shutdown mode, so a shutdown command does not pull the plug on production without a deliberate, confirmed action.

[### In the economy of user effort, be a bargain, not a scam (15 minute read)](https://lea.verou.me/blog/2025/user-effort/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Products win when user effort scales smoothly with use case complexity, usability cliffs are engineered out, and every interaction declares a meaningful piece of user intent. This requires hard tradeoffs, saying no a lot, and prioritizing user needs at the organizational level. Treating user effort like real money forces developers to design with restraint. Prioritize consumers over producers consistently to turn delight into trust, trust into loyalty, and loyalty into product-market fit.
