Details about Apple's rumored new home accessory have been leaked. The device, codenamed J490, combines the capabilities of the iPad, Apple TV, and HomePod. It will be powered by the A18 chip, presumably to support Apple Intelligence features. The device currently has a squarish display - it is unclear whether the square aspect ratio will make it to the final product. It has a built-in camera that works for FaceTime and other video conferencing apps. The camera can identify hand gestures from a distance and identify users to enable personal requests. More details about the device are available in the article.

[### Stem cells reverse woman's diabetes ‚Äî a world first (6 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03129-3?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A 25-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes has started producing her own insulin less than three months after receiving a transplant of reprogrammed stem cells. A year after the transplant, she can now eat sugar and enjoy eating everything. The surgery has completely reversed diabetes in the patient, who previously required substantial amounts of insulin. While the results are positive, they still need to be replicated in more people, and the researchers want to wait five more years before considering the patient as 'cured'.

[### Radian Aerospace completes ground tests of prototype space plane (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/radian-aerospace-completes-ground-taxi-tests-of-prototype-space-plane/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Radian Aerospace has announced the completion of a series of ground tests for its reusable space plane, which will be able to take off from airfields and land on runways like conventional airplanes. The tests were completed with a subscale prototype flight vehicle. They aimed to generate data on how the vehicle would fly and handle and to compare the data to simulations. While the vehicle did not fly, it did perform a series of small hops. The prototype vehicle is much smaller than the final vehicle, but the data will help inform key pieces of the final design and flight control systems.

[### Critical Mass and Tipping Points: How To Identify Inflection Points Before They Happen (26 minute read)](https://fs.blog/critical-mass/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The concept of critical mass can be used to understand everything from viral cat videos to why changing habits is so hard. Sometimes, it can seem as if drastic changes happen at random, but there is a logic to these occurrences that can be explained by the concept of critical mass - the point at which something is prevalent enough to grow or sustain a process, reaction, or technology. The concept can help us understand the world around us by letting us spot changes before they occur. A firm understanding can help give people an edge in launching products, changing habits, and choosing investments.
