### Big Tech & Startups

[### SpaceX, xAI Tie Up, Forming $1.25 Trillion Company (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-says-spacex-has-acquired-xai-038a4072?st=iVer2z&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX has acquired xAI. The combined company is valued at $1.25 trillion - the merger valued xAI at around $250 billion. The merger is structured as a share exchange, with shares in xAI being converted into 0.1433 shares of SpaceX stock. Employees will have the option to cash out and sell their xAI shares back to the company.

[### Anthropic is about to drop Sonnet 5 during Super Bowl week (1 minute read)](https://www.testingcatalog.com/anthropic-is-about-to-drop-sonnet-5-during-super-bowl-week/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Leaks show that a new model by Anthropic, branded as Claude Sonnet 5, has an internal date string of February 3, 2026. It is unclear whether this is a public launch date or an internal checkpoint. The timing would coincide with the Super Bowl, which is an event where AI labs have been ramping up mainstream marketing to chase consumer mindshare. Early testing indicates the model already looks competitive on math with today's frontier-tier models, and it shows even stronger coding output than Claude Opus 4.5 in some workflows.

[### Waymo raises massive $16 billion round at $126 billion valuation, plans expansion to 20+ cities (2 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2026/02/02/waymo-raises-16-billion-round-at-126-billion-valuation-plans-expansion/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Waymo just closed a $16 billion funding round at a $126 billion valuation. It plans to use the capital to expand to over 20 new cities this year, including its first international markets, Tokyo and London. The company's cars have driven 127 million fully autonomous miles with a 90% reduction in serious injury crashes compared to human drivers. It performed 15 million rides in 2025, a 3x growth from 2024.

[### Guinea worm on track to be 2nd eradicated human disease; only 10 cases in 2025 (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/guinea-worm-on-track-to-be-2nd-eradicated-human-disease-only-10-cases-in-2025/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Guinea worm is a parasitic nematode found in waters that contain small crustacean copepods. Humans can ingest them through contaminated water, and this results in painful blisters, usually in the feet and legs, that can cause searing pain as the worms fully emerge. The disease can lead to complications such as secondary infections and sepsis, which can in turn lead to temporary or permanent disability. There were only 10 human cases in three countries in 2025 - down from an estimated 3.5 million cases across 21 countries in 1986.

[### Introducing the Codex app (3 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/2/introducing-the-codex-app/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has released a new macOS app for its Codex coding agent. The app provides a nice UI over the capabilities of the Codex CLI agent and adds new features, like first-class support for Skills and Automations for running scheduled tasks. Automations are currently restricted to only run when devices are powered on. OpenAI will enable cloud-based automations soon to resolve this limitation.

[### Stop building systems for agents (4 minute read)](https://blog.xiangpeng.systems/posts/stop-building-agent-systems/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Today's systems are sub-optimal for AI agents as they waste context, confuse models with unstructured output, and prioritize vision-based human interaction over text-based LLMs. While some think this means we need to build systems that treat LLMs as first-class citizens, that approach is not totally required - if humans can live with it, LLMs will eventually catch up. Real agent-native systems should be radically observable and deterministic. It's better to focus on what LLMs can do for humans rather than think about what humans can do for LLMs.

Moltbook is an AI-only social network where tens of thousands of AI agents post and comment while humans observe. The platform grew from 42 posts per day to 36,905 in 72 hours. Social networks typically have 90% of users lurking, 9% contributing occasionally, and 1% creating the most content. AI agents are breaking that pattern. This post takes a look at posts made on the platform and how they differ from human-run social networks.

[### What Oracle Has to Lose From OpenAI and Nvidia's Rocky Relationship (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/what-oracle-has-to-lose-from-openai-and-nvidias-rocky-relationship-b1ec1e9d?st=Aa2uZg&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia's decision to potentially invest far less than $100 billion into OpenAI raises big questions for Oracle, like whether OpenAI can make good on its five-year, $300 billion contract with Oracle. Oracle reported $523 billion of remaining performance obligations in November, which represents contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue. It plans to issue as much as $20 billion of common stock this year as part of a broader plan to raise up to $50 billion through equity and debt financing to expand its cloud-infrastructure business. OpenAI has an estimated $1.4 trillion in commitments in total.
