[### Why we still believe in the future (8 minute read)](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/2022/12/boz-look-back-2023-look-ahead/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta remains as committed to its vision for the future as it was when it first announced it. 2022 was the year when foundational pieces of technology that will enable Meta's vision for the future went to developers and users for the first time. The long-term value of these technologies will come from how they are used by developers, creators, and builders. Meta's vision for the future will still take years to realize and the company will continue to invest in research and development.

[### Laser Fusion Ignition: Putting Nuclear Fusion Breakthroughs Into Perspective (6 minute read)](https://hackaday.com/2022/12/19/laser-fusion-ignition-putting-nuclear-fusion-breakthroughs-into-perspective/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US National Ignition Facility's recent announcement that it had produced a net fusion energy gain of about 1.5 does not mean that we have entered the age of commercial nuclear fusion reactors. The technology is still likely decades away. However, the achievement is still noteworthy. Putting a price tag on fundamental research makes little sense as the results of the research will make life easier for everyone.
