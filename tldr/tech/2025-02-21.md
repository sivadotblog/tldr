[### Amazon MGM Studios Gains Creative Control of James Bond Franchise From Broccoli Family (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/james-bond-franchise-amazon-mgm-studios-broccoli-family-14c0e6aa?st=Va12oh&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Broccoli family, which has long controlled the 007 franchise, will hand over creative control of the series to Amazon MGM Studios in a new joint venture with the studio. Amazon will now control who will play Bond, who will write the next script, and when the film goes into production. The financial terms of the joint venture have not been disclosed. Amazon and the Broccoli family have been at odds since the tech company acquired the rights to release Bond movies about three years ago.

[### OpenAI's GPT-4.5 May Arrive Next Week, but GPT-5 Is Just Around the Corner (3 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/openais-gpt-4-5-may-arrive-next-week-but-gpt-5-is-just-around-the-corner-2000566442?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI may be preparing to release GPT-4.5 as early as next week - anonymous sources say that the next model could hit the scene sometime this month. GPT-5 may be released as early as May. Microsoft has a good reason to want GPT-5 in May - its annual developer conference is on May 22. While GPT-5 may be more capable and efficient, it doesn't necessarily mean there will be any new use cases for AI.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Biggest-ever AI biology model writes DNA on demand (4 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00531-3?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have released an artificial intelligence model for biology trained on 128,000 genomes spanning the tree of life. It can make sense of existing DNA and also write whole chromosomes and small genomes from scratch. The model is available to scientists through a web interface - it can also be downloaded freely. The model could be used to help identify hard-to-interpret changes in people's genomes, decipher complex genomes, predict the effects of mutations, and more.

Figure has revealed a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for humanoid robots. VLAs leverage vision and language commands to process information, enabling robots to be trained through a combination of video and large language models. Figure's Helix model enables robots to follow natural language commands and pick up novel items with varying shapes, sizes, colors, and material properties never encountered before in training. Work on Helix is still at a very early stage, so demonstrations should be taken with a grain of salt.

[### Software engineering job openings hit five-year low? (15 minute read)](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineer-jobs-five-year-low/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There has been a 35% decrease in the number of software engineering job vacancies in the US since January 2020. While the story is similar in Canada, things are different in the UK, France, Germany, and Australia. Australia is the only country where the number of jobs listed is not lower than in 2020. Software development jobs have been the biggest boom and bust in vacancies compared to all industries. This post discusses the reasons for the decrease and predictions for what growth in the tech industry is likely to be like this year.

Tech startups used to raise huge sums to hire armies of workers and grow fast, but AI tools are enabling workers to be more efficient, making tiny teams more successful. Startups are using AI tools to increase employees' productivity in everything from customer service and marketing to coding and customer research. They are able to gain more revenue with fewer employees and less cash, something that wouldn't have been possible without the technology. The potential for AI to let startups do more with less has led to wild speculation about the future.
