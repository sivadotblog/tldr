[### Best Buy is the unlikely place to look for home run investments (Sponsor)](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=loki,05-20-2024)

The big-box retailer has a proven record of placing early bets on home-tech products that go on to dominate the market.

* Ring - acquired by Amazon for $1.2B
* Nest - acquired by Google for $3.2B

Early investors in these companies are sitting on some serious returns - but for the rest of us, there's still a chance to get in on the action with [RYSE](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=loki,05-20-2024).

History tends to repeat itself, and RYSE's launch +100 Best Buys points towards their company being the next [home run](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=loki,05-20-2024).

Their Smart Shade tech is poised to dominate an industry growing at 50% annually, and there's still time to invest in their $1.50/share public offering.

Apple is unveiling new generative AI features at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. While the company will still rely on the on-device approach, it's also planning to deliver services via the cloud. Apple will improve Siri's voice capabilities and add features like auto-summarizing notifications to help users with their day-to-day lives. Apple's generative AI technology isn't advanced enough for it to release its own chatbot, so it's teaming up with OpenAI to add the functionality to iOS 18.

Blue Origin has resumed crewed flights for the first time in two years. The company recently successfully brought six tourist crew members to the edge of space and back on its New Shepard rocket and crew capsule. Blue Origin had paused launches after a mission experienced an anomaly that caused it to abort after liftoff in August 2022. The company has flown a total number of 37 human passengers to space so far.

[### Trial HIV vaccine triggers elusive and essential antibodies, pointing the way toward a successful vaccine (6 minute read)](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-05-trial-hiv-vaccine-triggers-elusive.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Duke Human Vaccine Institute has developed an HIV vaccine candidate that triggers low levels of a type of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies within weeks. It targets an area of the HIV-1 outer envelope that remains stable even as the virus mutates. Antibodies against this region can block infection by many different circulating strains of HIV. More work still needs to be done to create a more robust response - a successful HIV vaccine will likely have at least three components all aimed at distinct regions of the virus.

[### Frozen human brain tissue was successfully revived for the first time (3 minute read)](https://bgr.com/science/frozen-human-brain-tissue-was-successfully-revived-for-the-first-time/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from China have found a way to thaw human brain tissue without damaging it. The scientists grew brain organoids from human embryonic stem cells and then tested various chemical compounds to determine which combinations could help keep frozen human brain tissue alive and enable growth after thawing. The most successful combination consisted of methylcellulose, ethylene glycol, DMSO, and Y27632. The researchers suspect it somehow interferes with a pathway that would otherwise initiate cell death, allowing for the issue to freeze and be thawed without incident.

[### System tests have failed (3 minute read)](https://world.hey.com/dhh/system-tests-have-failed-d90af718?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

System tests are supposed to offer greater confidence that a machine is working as it ought to. Developers automate testing to get quick feedback on changes, to catch regressions, and to become confident that a system works. System testing isn't the best way to fulfill all of these goals - sometimes it's better to embrace the human element and drop the automation. Not only will this allow you to know that the system works, it also lets you know whether the user interface 'feels right'.

[### Microsoft Plans Boldest Games Bet Since Activision Deal, Changing How ‚ÄòCall of Duty' Is Sold (5 minute read)](https://bit.ly/3wJjwdA)

Microsoft is releasing the next Call of Duty to its Game Pass subscription service. Players will still have the option to purchase the game outright. While this plan may mean people could end up paying Microsoft less to play the new game, the company hopes that it will draw new users to Game Pass who will end up paying more over the long term. Starfield, which was released on Game Pass at launch last year, drove a record number of new subscriptions in a single day.
