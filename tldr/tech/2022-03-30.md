### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### A novel medical method makes tissue transparent, substantially simplifying research (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/method-makes-tissue-transparent?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from Scripps Research have devised a way to make tissues transparent by using water-based hydrogels, allowing them to image large body parts or even entire animals. The technique results in high transparency, protein retention, and compatibility with direct fluorescent imaging and immunostaining in cleared mammalian bodies. It has been used to image SARS-CoV-2-infected cells in the whole chests of mice. The technique could help scientists better understand many diseases.

[### HB11's hydrogen-boron laser fusion test yields groundbreaking results (5 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/energy/hb11-laser-fusion-demonstration/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

HB11, an Australian company, is using high-power, high-precision lasers to create nuclear fusion reactions. Its approach doesn't require huge amounts of heat or radioactive fuels like tritium. HB11's hydrogen-boron energy technology uses boron as a fuel and doesn't produce any nuclear waste. It is four orders of magnitude from achieving net energy gain and shows great potential for clean energy generation. Many more details about how HB11's hydrogen-boron energy technology works are available in the article.

[### Scientists Spot Signs of Huge Ice Volcanoes on Pluto (2 minute read)](https://www.cnet.com/science/space/scientists-spot-signs-of-huge-ice-volcanoes-on-pluto/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Data sent back from NASA's New Horizons mission during its 2015 flyby of Pluto suggested the presence of relatively recent ice volcanoes on the dwarf planet. A recently published study adds more evidence to their existence. The ice volcanoes are found in an area with few impact craters and can reach up to 4.3 miles in height. Their existence suggests that Pluto's interior structure allows for either advanced heat retention or more heat overall than was previously anticipated. Ice volcanoes have also been discovered in other parts of the solar system.
