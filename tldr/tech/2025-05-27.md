[### Apple to Unveil 'Solarium' UI Overhaul for All Devices at WWDC (2 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/apple-solarium-ios-19-ui-overhaul-for-all-devices-wwdc-2025?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple plans to introduce a design overhaul for all of its operating systems at WWDC. The updated interface, codenamed 'Solarium', will give the operating systems a more slick and modern appearance. It borrows a lot of elements from visionOS. The UI overhaul will be the biggest for iPhones since iOS 7 in 2013 and for Macs since macOS Big Sur in 2020.

[### SpaceX Pushes to Get Starship Rocket Ready for Mars by Next Year (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/science/space-astronomy/spacex-starship-mars-military-elon-musk-3240c18d?st=gRZyzg&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX has been moving more employees into Starship roles in recent months. The space company has also been making big investments in its complex in Texas for the vehicle and has similar plans for Florida. It is behind schedule on a variant of Starship for a NASA mission to the moon currently set for 2027. SpaceX has been struggling this year, with back-to-back Starship flight tests that ended in explosions.

[### Should Everyone Be Taking Ozempic? Doctors Say More People Could Benefit (8 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/glp-1-drugs-health-benefits-4014d7d5?st=3rm55P&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The number of diseases that the GLP-1 category of drugs seems to be effective in treating is expanding rapidly. The drug could be beneficial to a third to a majority of adults. Many of the proven and potential benefits of the drugs cascade from their effect on obesity, but some are independent of weight loss, possibly from the anti-inflammatory effects of the drugs.

[### TSMC Bets On Unorthodox Optical Tech (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/microled-optical-chiplet?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

TSMC is working with startup Avicena to produce microLED-based interconnects. The technology is designed to meet the high needs of communication among an increasing number of GPUs in a low-cost, energy-efficient way. AI clusters are facing unprecedented requirements - sooner or later, the copper wires that connect processors and memory within a single AI data rack will have to be replaced with optics. Avicena's approach is very unorthodox, but it is ideal for these short-distance applications.

[### I Think It's Time to Give Nix a Chance (16 minute read)](https://maych.in/blog/its-time-to-give-nix-a-chance/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nix was designed to solve the lack of true reproducibility in software development. While it has been around for two decades, Nix has largely flown under the radar of mainstream development. This is likely due to its steep learning curve. However, the tooling around Nix has matured significantly, so it's now worth giving it a try.

[### Ask HN: Anyone struggling to get value out of coding LLMs? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44095189&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While some engineers can't seem to stop raving about how much of a superpower large language models are for coding, others find it to be an extremely finicky process that requires an extreme amount of coddling to get average results at best. This could be because of the type of work the engineers are doing - AI seems to be productive for greenfield work, but it is pretty useless when it comes to maintaining existing systems, adding more complicated features, or needing to know business domain details. Some engineers find it much quicker and easier to just write code themselves as they always do a better job in the end.

Kodgem built its business around a device that helped people with their posture. Despite the company's growth to $1 million in revenue, there was zero profit for its founders due to several mistakes, including inventory planning disasters, no real financial management, and failed marketplace partnerships. The founders never paid themselves, causing them to almost burn out completely multiple times. They had gotten caught up in the growth story and forgotten the most basic rule of business: you need to make more money than you spend.

[### Big Banks Explore Venturing Into Crypto World Together With Joint Stablecoin (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/crypto-stablecoin-big-banks-a841059e?st=rts6nw&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The biggest banks in the US are in discussions about whether to team up and issue a joint stablecoin. The talks are in early stages and any final decision would depend on how stablecoins will be legislated. Banks have been bracing for the possibility that stablecoins could become widely adopted under President Trump. Stablecoins could speed up more routine transactions, but there is still some skepticism about the security of the technology and the regulatory implications of getting involved with digital assets.
