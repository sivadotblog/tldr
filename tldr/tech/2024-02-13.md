[### How many people are downloading Apple Vision Pro apps? (11 minute read)](https://www.immersivewire.com/p/downloads-apple-vision-pro-app-store?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

More than 600 apps made for the Apple Vision Pro were available when the device launched on February 2. Developers are complaining that weak discovery and search functionalities in the App Store are dampening the potential success of their apps. The top paid news app receives over 300 installs a day, which is great for a headset that just launched. Promoting apps on social media appears to give transient success, but this might not be enough for consistent gains over the long run.

[### Microsoft prepares to take Xbox everywhere (7 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A number of Xbox exclusives are coming to the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. The first two games set to appear on rival consoles are Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment, with Sea of Thieves set to launch later this year. The move is a seismic shift in strategy - while it will give Microsoft more reach, it comes with plenty of risks. Microsoft plans to continue its Xbox hardware efforts, but its vision for the platform is unclear.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### The VR race is back on (7 minute read)](https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1757090367848280075?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The VR market size is growing fast but still relatively small. Retention is just OK - the technology is stickiest for use cases that most people might not understand. There is real money to be made in the space. One effective strategy seems to be using VR to create an experience that creates a lot of buzz and then add cross-platform capabilities, allowing apps to reach a much larger audience. The competition between the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest platforms will benefit developers and create more experimentation within the ecosystem.

[### Shining Laser Light on Glass Creates a Solar Cell (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/next-generation-solar-transparent-glass?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Glass made from tellurium behaves like a photovoltaic cell, generating a current when a femtosecond laser light is fired at it. This discovery opens up the possibility of windows that may double up as energy-generating surfaces. The effect may possibly be seen in other forms of glass - scientists have had no reason to explore how femtosecond lasers affected different kinds of glass until now. Tellurite glass has enhanced transparency in the mid-infrared region and higher solubility for rare-earth ions, making it attractive for optical fibers and optical amplifiers.

[### The top of the DNS hierarchy (22 minute read)](https://computer.rip/2024-02-11-the-top-of-the-DNS-hierarchy.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Not all distributed systems are decentralized - many are not. One of the easiest and most practical ways to organize a distributed system is according to a hierarchy. The most prominent example of this is one of the drivetrain mechanics of the internet: DNS. This article looks at how DNS works. It covers how domains work, root servers, anycast, attacks, and more. While DNS may seem simple, it relies on a great deal of complexity within other parts of the system.

[### ‚ÄúAccelerationism‚Äù is an overdue corrective to years of doom and gloom in Silicon Valley (30 minute read)](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/tech-strikes-back?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

E/acc, or effective accelerationism, is a movement that is growing within the tech hivemind. Its founders believe that the tech world has become captive to a monoculture that is preventing it from producing meaningful benefits. E/acc encourages more ideas, growth, competition, and action. It is acting like a counterbalancing force to widespread public concerns about the risks posed by the tech industry at large. This article looks into the origins of e/acc and its impact on the tech industry.

[### The compounding seeds of creativity (3 minute read)](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-compounding-seeds-of-creativity-e7e212c0?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Creativity can't be saved for later - it has to be discharged regularly or it will spoil. Being fully engaged at work is how you best plant the seeds for your own adventures. Those who constantly use up their creativity grow their intellectual granary many times over than those who keep holding back. People who turn boring problems into interesting pursuits always end up ahead in creativity and competence.
