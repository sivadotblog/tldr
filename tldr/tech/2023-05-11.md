[### First UK baby with DNA from three people born after new IVF procedure (5 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/09/first-uk-baby-with-dna-from-three-people-born-after-new-ivf-procedure?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Doctors in the UK have successfully performed an IVF procedure resulting in a child born with DNA from three people. The treatment, called mitochondrial donation treatment, involves taking healthy tissue from the eggs of female donors whose DNA is free from harmful mutations that predispose the mother to inheritable diseases. The material is used to create an embryo that has DNA from both biological parents as well as around 37 genes from the donor's egg. More than 99.8% of the offspring's DNA still comes from the biological parents.

[### Vast says it will launch its first space station in 2025 on a Falcon 9 (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/vast-says-it-will-launch-its-first-space-station-in-2025-on-a-falcon-9/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Vast has announced plans to launch a commercial space station by August 2025. The Haven-1 module will be deployed in low-Earth orbit. The module will undergo initial testing for several weeks, after which four astronauts will spend around a month onboard before returning to Earth. Vast has made commercial crew seats for both the initial mission and a second mission in 2026 available for sale. NASA will likely be decommissioning the ISS in 2030, after which it will lease crew time on commercial space stations.
