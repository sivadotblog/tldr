[### Humanoid Robots Are Lousy Co-Workers. China Wants to Be First to Change That (8 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/humanoid-robots-are-lousy-co-workers-china-wants-to-be-first-to-change-that-0fe8528c?st=beJgvY&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese startup UBTech is training human-like robots to sort auto parts and move containers. The AI-powered robots can work with other robots and figure out on their own how to get the job done - and also learn how to do it better. It currently takes two of UBTech's robots around 12 seconds to load a container onto a truck together, compared to three seconds for human workers, but the robots are expected to get faster and they can work around the clock. The startup plans to deliver 500 to 1,000 of its robots to clients this year.

Gemini 2.5 Pro, an experimental thinking model from Google, has become the talk of the town since its release. It is better at coding, has a one million token context window, and it's free.
