Apple may be preparing to launch a new external display this year. The display will be slightly smaller than the Pro Display XDR and about half the price. A leak in December suggested that Apple was developing 24-inch and 27-inch external displays. Apple is also working on a successor to the Pro Display XDR with an Apple-made SoC and Neural Engine.

[### Intel and Samsung‚Äôs new demo shows how blisteringly fast a PCIe 5.0 SSD setup will be (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860374/intel-samsung-ces-2022-demo-pcie-5-0-ssd-setup-speed-test?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Samsung‚Äôs new PM1743 PCIe NVMe SSD can hit data speeds over 13GB/s in real world tests. A recent video demo from Intel shows the hard drive working with Intel‚Äôs Core i9-12900K CPU to hit speeds more than twice as fast as the PlayStation 5's PCIe Gen 4 SSD. The drive will likely come with a hefty price tag when consumer-grade versions are released. A video showing a speed test of the drive is available in the article.

[### Reusable "Microballoons" could give satellites a run for their money (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/science/microballoons-reusable-stratospheric-balloons/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Urban Sky's Microballoon system can take high-res aerial photographs at a much lower cost than satellites, drones, or full-sized aircraft. Each Microballoon consists of a reusable stratospheric balloon and a payload module that houses a high-res optical camera. The system can image approximately 1,000 square kilometers per hour. Microballoons are already being used by a handful of paying clients. Urban Sky recently won a contract from the US Air Force to develop Microballoons for real-time monitoring of forest fires.

[### Building the world's brightest X-ray laser (3 minute read)](https://www.cnet.com/news/building-the-worlds-brightest-x-ray-laser/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) will be the second world-class X-ray laser at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. It will be capable of firing up to 1 million light pulses per second, with beams 10,000 times brighter than its predecessor. The beams are run through a series of alternating magnets to produce X-rays, which are then used to create molecular movies. LCLS-II will allow scientists to answer questions regarding energy transfer, possibly leading to the improvement of technologies like solar power. A video that shows what it is like inside the more than 2-mile long tunnel that houses LCLS-II is available in the article.
