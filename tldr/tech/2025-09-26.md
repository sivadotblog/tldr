[### Trump approves TikTok deal through executive order, Vance says business valued at $14 billion (4 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-approves-tiktok-deal-through-executive-order.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday approving a proposal that could keep TikTok alive in the US. The deal would involve creating a new joint-venture company that will oversee TikTok's US business. China has yet to approve the terms. No representatives from ByteDance were present at the signing, and the company has not acknowledged that a transaction is taking place. There is no indication that the Chinese government has made changes to laws that would be necessary for a deal to take place.

[### SpaceX Wants to Fly Its Gigantic Starship Directly Over Florida (4 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/spacex-wants-to-fly-its-gigantic-starship-directly-over-florida-2000663730?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX has proposed a flight path for its Starship rocket that would see it fly across Florida skies. The route would seriously disrupt air traffic and raise the risk of debris falling onto populated areas. Starship's test flights have so far only taken the megarocket on suborbital trajectories. SpaceX is preparing the rocket to reach low Earth orbit and complete a full trip around the planet before returning for a landing attempt.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### World's first ‚Äòbehavior transplant' between species achieved (5 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/biology/unknown-behavior-gene-transfer/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from Nagoya University transferred the courtship behavior from one species of fruit fly to another by manipulating a single gene to create new neural connections. While both species of fly belong to the same family, they have distinct neural circuits that drive very different mating behaviors. The achievement was the culmination of nearly a decade's work by several members of the Japanese team. It is the first-ever example of humans manipulating a single gene to transfer foreign behavior to another species.

[### The reason gene editing hasn't transformed human health is that current gene editing technologies like CRISPR are very limited (2 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1971293821418995988.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at the Arc Institute have developed a new DNA editing technology that can seamlessly write massive changes into the right place in the human genome. Bridge RNAs in bacterial 'jumping genes' allowed the scientists to make safe and arbitrary changes to every nucleotide within (up to) a 1 million base pair sequence in human DNA. They can be used to correct disease-causing DNA repeats in Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's, and other repeat expansion disorders.

[### Becoming a Research Engineer at a Big LLM Lab - 18 Months of Strategic Job Hunting (41 minute read)](https://www.maxmynter.com/pages/blog/jobhunt?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Max Mynter signed as a research engineer with Mistral earlier this week. The road to getting there was not an accident - Mynter had strategically worked towards this outcome for an extended period. This account of his personal experiences shares a few things that worked out for him. Mynter's main tactic was to try to get an information advantage and then act on this information to be prepared when it matters. The preparation can involve strategic high-effort projects or tactical quick-win initiatives.

[### There Are More Robots Working in China Than the Rest of the World Combined (8 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/business/china-factory-robots.html?unlocked_article_code=1.o08.iRYD.xPlmT-Iic4Zd&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China has five times as many robots working in its factories as the US. Until last year, China installed more imported robots in its factories than domestically made ones - last year, nearly three-fifths of the robots installed in the country were made locally. While Chinese companies still lag behind foreign competitors in their ability to manufacture some key components, China has a large number of skilled electricians and specialized computer programmers who can install robots, as well as an artificial intelligence industry that is strongly focused on tracking and improving every aspect of factory equipment performance.
