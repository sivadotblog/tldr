[### Key OpenAI Executive Played a Pivotal Role in Sam Altman‚Äôs Ouster (9 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/technology/openai-executives-role-in-sam-altman-ouster.html?unlocked_article_code=1.a00.qm8I.UrNbQdRlYGEA&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's chief technology officer Mira Murati questioned Sam Altman's management in front of the board last year before Altman was briefly ousted from the company. This move helped to propel the board's decision to force Altman out. Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and chief scientist of OpenAI, expressed similar concerns. Both executives said that Altman sometimes created a toxic work environment by freezing out executives who did not support his decisions. WilmerHale, the law firm investigating the incident, is expected to release a report in the coming days that could shed more light on the board's decision.

[### New Weight Loss Pill More Effective Than Ozempic, Tests Find (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/neoscope/new-weight-loss-pill-more-effective-than-ozempic?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Novo Nordisk's new obesity treatment drug, amycretin, helped patients lose 13% of their body weight in just 12 weeks. The drug may be more effective than semaglutide. Amycretin targets GLP-1 and another hormone called amylin, both of which are believed to be linked to hunger and satiety. The drug still needs to go through much larger trials that will likely drag on for years before it will be publicly available. The results of the initial trials sent Novo Nordisk's stock rising as much as 8.3%.

[### Engineer plans solar panel implant for human retina to retain eyesight (4 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/solar-panels-restore-vision?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Engineers from the University of New South Wales in Australia are working on a prototype solar panel implant for the retinas to restore sight. The implant converts light into electrical signals that can be directed to the optic nerve, enabling vision. Users may need to wear special glasses or goggles that amplify sunlight for the device to work. The device is still in a proof-of-concept stage - a lot more work still needs to be done before it is ready for human implantation.

[### Why Facebook doesn‚Äôt use Git (12 minute read)](https://graphite.dev/blog/why-facebook-doesnt-use-git?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mercurial is a tool for creating and managing code changes used at Facebook. Facebook started out on Git, but it began hitting scaling limits in around 2012. Mercurial's developers were receptive to the idea of Facebook engineers contributing patches to scale it better while Git's developers were not. There were other alternatives, but all were quickly disqualified. Facebook adopted Mercurial not because it had better technology, but because the maintainers and codebase felt more open.
