[### Eli Lilly Says Its New Weight-Loss Pill Is Highly Effective (5 minute read)](https://time.com/7308056/weight-loss-pill-eli-lilly/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Eli Lilly has developed a new pill that causes obese people to lose significant amounts of weight. The drug targets GLP-1, potentially increasing access to GLP-1 medications due to price and ease of application. Its side effect profile is similar to that of the injectable GLP-1 drugs. Eli Lilly plans to file for approval for the drug by the end of the year.

[### FDA approves breakthrough eye drops that fix near vision without glasses (6 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/aging/age-related-near-sighted-drops-vizz/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved an eye drop that improves near vision in adults with presbyopia, a condition that causes near-sighted vision loss. The aceclidine-based eye drops offer relief from blurry near vision for up to 10 hours. They work by gently shrinking the pupil of the eye, creating a pinhole effect that helps bring nearby objects into sharper focus. The eyedrops do not significantly affect the eye's focusing muscles, so using them doesn't blur distance vision or cause myopic shift.

Ignore the claims about vibe coding or that you don't need to know how to write code, and instead look for ways to augment what you do. Experiment with AI and discover what value you can extract - there's a lot of grift. Learn for yourself what works and what doesn't. AI in its current form won't ever replace hands-on-keyboards, and it won't replace engineering.

[### Intel's CEO, Under Attack From Trump, Is Already at Odds With His Board (7 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-trump-board-9cc08631?st=akhCcA&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Intel's Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan and some Intel directors disagree on topics as central as whether the company should stay in the manufacturing business or exit it entirely. Tan recently tried to raise new capital to acquire an artificial intelligence company, but efforts have been stalled by people on the board. Despite Trump unexpectedly calling for Tan's ouster, the company is so far standing by Tan, saying that the board and Tan are all deeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests. While Intel's chip factories are a money loser, some view them as politically important because they help secure the US semiconductor supply chain.
