[### Meta to Reduce VP Positions From 300 to 250 (2 minute read)](https://www.pymnts.com/meta/2024/report-meta-to-reduce-vp-positions-from-300-to-250/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta is reportedly looking to cut down on its number of vice-president positions from 300 to about 250. The company's job cuts were guided by principles focused on making Meta an even stronger technology company. These principles included removing multiple layers of management, canceling projects, making every organization leaner, building an optimal ratio of engineers to other roles, and investing in AI and other tools. Meta's capital expenditures on AI and Reality Labs will range between $35 billion and $40 billion by the end of 2024.

[### Apple to ‚ÄòPay' OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash (5 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/apple-to-pay-openai-for-chatgpt-through-distribution-not-cash?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxODIzODgyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzE4ODQzNjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRVhOTjlUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.Ger9daQzJU8oCPduPpYyIv09c-rH3LP0NnsfH5mYCSo&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple and OpenAI's partnership isn't expected to generate meaningful revenue for either party, at least at the beginning. Apple believes that pushing OpenAI's brand and technology to its devices is of equal or greater value than monetary payments so it isn't paying OpenAI as part of the deal. The deal isn't exclusive - Apple is already discussing offering other chatbots as additional options. Apple eventually plans to make money from AI by striking revenue-sharing agreements with AI partners.

[### Giant Chips Give Supercomputers a Run for Their Money (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cerebras-wafer-scale-engine?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cerebras, a California-based company, has demonstrated that its second-generation wafer-scale engine is significantly faster than the world's faster supercomputer in molecular dynamics calculations. It can also perform sparse large language model inference at one-third of the energy cost of a full model without losing any accuracy. Both achievements are possible due to the interconnects and fast memory access enabled by Cerebras' hardware. Cerebras is looking to extend the applications of its wafer-scale engine to a larger class of problems, including molecular dynamics simulations of biological processes and simulations of airflow around vehicles.

[### Silicon Valley's Best Kept Secret: Founder Liquidity (7 minute read)](https://www.stefantheard.com/silicon-valleys-best-kept-secret-founder-liquidity/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Founder liquidity is the practice where founders sell a portion of their shares during a funding round. It allows founders to reduce risk and secure personal financial stability while continuing to build the company with a fresh influx of venture capital. The practice is often kept secret because it undermines the narrative of the founder who is 'all-in'. It might change how startups are perceived and valued if it were widely known that founders could de-risk their financial position while their employees remained all-in.
