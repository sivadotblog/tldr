[### OpenAI Completes For-Profit Transition, Pushing Microsoft Above $4 Trillion Valuation (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-converts-to-public-benefit-corporation-with-microsoft-taking-27-stake-714a6c05?st=bVNcLz&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has successfully converted to a more traditional corporate structure. It has turned its for-profit subsidiary into a public-benefit corporation. The new structure will make it easier for the company to raise money and attract talent, and could clear the path for an initial public offering. OpenAI continues to face litigation over its corporate status. Microsoft owns a 27% stake in the new public-benefit corporation.

Tesla is prepared to name a new Chief Executive Officer from inside the company if shareholders reject Elon Musk's proposed $1 trillion pay package and he steps down. The unprecedented pay package will be voted on at the company's annual meeting on November 6. It is designed to incentivize Musk and ensure that development around AI and other new products happens within Tesla rather than with one of Musk's multiple other ventures. Shareholders will also vote on whether to invest in xAI at the annual meeting.

[### Nvidia and Uber Say They're Building a 100,000-Vehicle Robotaxi Network (2 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/nvidia-and-uber-say-theyre-building-a-100000-vehicle-robotaxi-network-2000677945?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia and Uber plan to start rolling out a fleet of robotaxis in 2027. The companies are aiming for 100,000 vehicles, but there is no timeline yet for when they will reach that level of scale. The robotaxis will use Nvidia's latest in-vehicle computer, the Drive AGX Hyperion 10, which Nvidia claims makes cars ready for level-4 automation. It will enable vehicles to drive completely autonomously within designated areas.

[### The New Calculus of AI-based Coding (13 minute read)](https://blog.joemag.dev/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Feature flags are a powerful mechanism for services delivering new capabilities. They can be especially effective in helping control the blast radius in case of unforeseen problems with new features. However, they come with operational and cognitive costs, so it's important to have a way to bound the number of feature flags within the code base at any point in time. Feature flag toggles are no different than any other code changes, as they change the behavior of the service, so consider using the same mechanisms for deployment.

[### How Agentic Payments are Reinventing a 90s Internet Standard (21 minute read)](https://panteracapital.com/http-402s-modern-makeover/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

HTTP's placeholder status code, 402: Payment Required, was meant to make payments as seamless as loading an image or video. It has been left undefined for years. Instead of protocol-native micropayments, the web economy was forced down the path of advertising, walled gardens, and awkward credit card forms. HTTP 402 has recently resurfaced as the foundation of an emerging agent-driven economy. New standards like x402 and h402 may finally make payments as native and invisible as information itself.

[### Meta's $75B AI Infrastructure Bet: Inside the Biggest Cloud Deals of 2025 (13 minute read)](https://allenarch.dev/blog/meta-75b-ai-infrastructure-bet/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta is now spending more than a third of every dollar earned on AI infrastructure. The company announced $75.5 billion in infrastructure deals in just three months - more than most countries spend on their entire tech sector in a decade. It is betting that AI will improve ad targeting, improve new products, and create infrastructure business. However, if AI doesn't deliver proportional revenue growth, Meta is stuck with $600 billion in sunk costs, 16-year lease commitments, and massive depreciation expenses.

[### OpenAI's Promise to Stay in California Helped Clear the Path for Its IPO (7 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-promise-to-stay-in-california-helped-clear-the-path-for-its-ipo-3af1c31c?st=FRh677&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI spent months making the case to regulators that it was the economic heart of the California economy, and that it would be willing to leave if its plan to convert to a simpler corporate structure was blocked. When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman spoke with California Attorney General Rob Bonta nearly two weeks ago to discuss the issue, Altman made it clear that he was committed to his home state and that OpenAI wouldn't sue it or leave it. The discussion proved decisive - Bonta's office ended its extended investigation into the company. The final deal included a pledge for OpenAI to remain in California and expand its presence there.
