[### Apple Exploring 'Mobile Robot' That 'Follows Users Around Their Homes' (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/apple-reportedly-investigating-robotics/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is reportedly exploring various personal robotics projects in an effort to create its next big thing. These include a mobile robot that follows people around their homes and a tabletop device that uses robotics to move a display around. The projects are said to be in the very early stages of research and it is unclear if any of them will ever be released. Apple apparently considered developing robots that can handle chores but decided against it for now due to extraordinarily difficult engineering challenges.

[### Europe‚Äôs space agency prepares to blot out the Sun (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/3/24120149/european-space-agency-artificial-solar-eclipse-proba-3-spacecraft-corona-study?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The European Space Agency (ESA) plans to use two separate spacecraft to create its own solar eclipse to study the Sun's corona. The spacecraft will fly 150 meters apart, aligned so that one satellite blocks out all but of corona from the other satellite. They will have to fly in precise formation down to millimeter accuracy. Studying the Sun's corona will reveal details about its role in our solar system's weather. The ESA hopes to launch the mission in September.

[### ‚ÄòMini liver‚Äô will grow in person‚Äôs own lymph node in bold new trial (3 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00975-z?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new experimental treatment developed by biotechnology firm LyGenesis may lead to patients growing an additional miniature liver. The approach involves injecting healthy liver cells into a lymph node in the upper abdomen of a patient with liver failure. The cells multiply and take over the lymph node to form a structure that can perform a liver's blood-filtering duties. The first person who received the treatment (on March 25) is recovering well, but they will need to be closely monitored for a while to see if the treatment is both safe and effective. The treatment has worked so far in mice, dogs, and pigs.

[### The Many, Confusing File System APIs (14 minute read)](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/the-many-confusing-file-system-apis/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Googling 'File System API' will bring up a lot of similarly named APIs. This can get confusing as there are multiple standards and names, but there are actually fewer than it seems at first and many build on each other, adding layers of functionality. This article gives a tour of the different file system APIs. Interacting with file systems is complex - the different APIs handle different actions and security concerns.

[### Why is observability so expensive? (11 minute read)](https://mattklein123.dev/2024/04/03/observability-cost-crisis/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Observability costs are on top of mind for many organizations. This post covers a brief history of modern observability, how the industry arrived at its current observability cost crisis, and a new way of thinking about observability costs and pricing models. Over the past few decades, infrastructure-as-a-service providers and open source have made it easy to produce voluminous amounts of telemetry, while little regard has been given to the cost or storage of the telemetry output, causing a cost crisis in observability tooling. One solution may be to not send any observability data by default.

[### A first look at Europe‚Äôs alternative iPhone app stores (12 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/24100979/altstore-europe-app-marketplace-price-games?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There is currently only one third-party iOS app store live in Europe. Other app stores have been announced and some are in the review process. One reason for the lack of alternative app stores is due to Apple's Core Technology Fee, which requires developers to pay Apple 50 euro cents for every annual app install over one million, with third-party app store developers paying the fee for every first annual install of their app marketplace. Apple has also made installing third-party marketplaces a hassle, requiring around a dozen screen interactions to install each store.

[### Startups are all about transparency (7 minute read)](https://twitter.com/0zne/status/1774889526521155778?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

One topic in the startup world is extremely opaque: founders' salaries. This causes founders to make all kinds of mistakes, like paying themselves too early, too late, too little, or too much. Founders don't get rich with their salaries: most of the money comes from IPOs, secondaries, and acquisitions. Being a founder means having to learn to deal with financial uncertainty.
