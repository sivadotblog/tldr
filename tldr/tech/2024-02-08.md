### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Europe’s deepest mine to become giant gravity battery (3 minute read)](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/gravity-battery-mine-renewable-energy-b2492087.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Pyhäsalmi Mine, an abandoned mine in Finland, is set to be transformed into a giant gravity battery to store renewable energy. The 1,400-meter-deep mine holds the potential to store up to 2 MW of energy. Gravity batteries are charged by lifting heavy weights - these weights are then released, and energy from the drop is used to power a turbine. The technology offers a potential future for mines approaching the end of their original service lives. Studies suggest that gravity batteries in abandoned mines could store enough energy to meet global electricity demands.

[### Momentary Fusion Breakthroughs Face Hard Reality (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-long-road?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new paper has confirmed the National Ignition Facility's claim that they finally achieved a breakeven fusion reaction. While there is still considerable work to be done, the achievement signals a major milestone in fusion science. It demonstrated that there is nothing fundamentally limiting scientists from being able to harness fusion in the laboratory. The team has since carried out six more experiments, four of which generated significantly more energy than in the breakthrough experiment.

[### jQuery 4.0.0 BETA! (24 minute read)](https://blog.jquery.com/2024/02/06/jquery-4-0-0-beta/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The jQuery 4.0.0 beta features bug fixes, performance improvements, and some breaking changes, like the removal of support for IE<11. Other breaking changes include the removal of previously deprecated APIs, internal-only parameters to public functions, and support for some magic behaviors that were overly complicated. A comprehensive upgrade guide will be published before the final release. This article covers some of the highlights of the jQuery 4.0.0 beta.

[### Scriptisto (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/igor-petruk/scriptisto?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scriptisto is a language-agnostic shebang interpreter that enables developers to write scripts in compiled languages. It combines a scripting development experience with the performance of strongly typed native languages such as C, C++, and Rust. Scriptisto can build in Docker, so there is no need to have a compiler on users' machines - static binaries can be linked in the container that has all the tools.

A network state is the idea that an online community could eventually move offline into the real world, with the purchase of land and a community of inhabitants, and become large enough that at least one pre-existing government is moved to offer diplomatic recognition. There are many possible ways the idea can play out, but states must be based on something like a moral innovation or a 'one commandment'. There are several network-state-inspired projects underway. This article looks at the concept of the network state and the projects that are building towards it.
