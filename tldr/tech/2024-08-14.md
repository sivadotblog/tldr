The Department of Justice is considering breaking up Alphabet following a ruling that found the company monopolized the online search market. The most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Chrome web browser. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products. The government will likely see a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of the case.

[### Amazon Vies for Nuclear-Powered Data Center (5 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/amazon-data-center-nuclear-power?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Proposals for co-locating data centers next to nuclear power have popped up in several places. The setup allows for data centers to draw clean electricity directly rather than from the grid while avoiding paying fees that would otherwise help maintain grids. It also means that data centers are hogging hundreds of megawatts that could be going to other customers. Amazon is currently dealing with regulatory hurdles over a deal that would give one of its data centers an extra 180 megawatts of power as it would hurt all of the customers that buy from the facility.

An analysis of observations from the James Webb Space Telescope shows conflicting cosmic expansion rates from different types of data. The cosmic expansion rate has been consistently measured to be higher than the theoretical prediction for how fast space should be expanding. However, different teams have come up with different rates of expansion. These discrepancies suggest that the theoretical model of the cosmos might be missing something.

Creating a source code tarball is quite tricky to do by hand. While it is possible to just run 'tar' over a currently checked out source tree, developers need to be careful that the checkout is clean and not locally modified and ensure that all the files that belong in the tarball end up there and no other files. The resulting tarball should work consistently across platforms and across time. This article looks at how PostgreSQL makes a release.

[### Deep-Live-Cam goes viral, allowing anyone to become a digital doppelganger (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/new-ai-tool-enables-real-time-face-swapping-on-webcams-raising-fraud-concerns/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Deep-Live-Cam can take a person's face and apply it to a live webcam video source while following pose, lighting, and expressions - from a single photo. It is available for download for free on GitHub. There are many face-swapping software projects out there - while most of them take some knowledge to install, it is only a matter of time before these tools become more accessible. Examples of face swaps produced with the tool are available.

[### American Vulcan (92 minute read)](https://www.tabletmag.com/feature/american-vulcan-palmer-luckey-anduril?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Palmer Luckey was born in 1992 to Donald and Julie Freeman Luckey. He was homeschooled along with his three younger sisters on the bottom floor of a small multifamily home in Long Beach, at the edge of Los Angeles. Luckey single-handedly turned virtual reality from the laughingstock of the technology industry into a multi-billion-dollar enterprise by inventing the Oculus Rift in a camper trailer. The facts of Luckey's life are uniquely bizarre - this article takes a look at his life and what he's done since selling Oculus to Facebook for $2.7 billion.
