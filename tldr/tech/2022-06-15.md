[### How Apple could kill CAPTCHAs with Private Access Tokens (3 minute read)](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/06/14/how-apple-could-kill-captchas-with-private-access-tokens?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple plans to kill CAPTCHAs with its new Private Access Tokens technology. Private Access Tokens can prove that an HTTP request is coming from a human by recognizing if a client device is following typical user patterns. Signed tokens are sent to servers in a multi-step process that doesn't involve the server knowing anything about the device or user. Using Private Access Tokens requires a device running iOS 16 or macOS Ventura. Apple is working to make Private Access Tokens a web standard. More on how the technology works is available in the article.

[### Plants Appear to Be Breaking Biochemistry Rules by Making 'Secret Decisions' (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/plants-are-making-decisions-about-how-much-carbon-to-release-breaking-biochemistry-rules?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from Australia have discovered that plants can control how much carbon from photosynthesis they keep to build biomass by using metabolic channels. They can choose to burn pyruvate and release carbon or use it to build phospholipids, plant oils, amino acids, or other biomass building blocks. Plants can track the source of the pyruvate and choose to either release it or hold onto it for other purposes. The ability to make decisions breaks the normal rules of biochemistry.
