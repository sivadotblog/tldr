[### Scientists zap clouds with electricity to make them rain (1 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/nov/03/scientists-zap-clouds-electricity-make-rain?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

New experiments show that zapping clouds with electricity can alter droplet sizes in fog and potentially help clouds to rain. The effect can be observed whether zapping fog with positive or negative charges. Electric charges can slow evaporation. These findings could be used in dry regions of the world to encourage clouds to release rain.

[### The Sci-Fi Dream of a ‚ÄòMolecular Computer‚Äô Is Getting More Real (3 minute read)](https://archive.ph/SuPoY?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists believe that tiny molecular versions of the Turing machine could help make new drugs or materials with precise traits. Cells already have a natural form of this and can turn sequences of mRNA into proteins. There are no working examples of molecular computers, but experiments have shown that the fundamental processes of physics and chemistry can be used to relay information at the molecular level. The current 'read' processes are still very slow and scientists still haven't developed techniques for fabricating new materials at that scale.

jc is a command-line tool and Python library that can convert the output of many CLI tools, file types, and common strings into JSON for easier parsing in scripts. It can be used in piped commands for further command-line processing of outputs. If used as a Python library, jc outputs either a Python dictionary, a list of dictionaries, or a lazy iterable of dictionaries.
