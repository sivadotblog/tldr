Mobile QA cycles are painfully slow when testing is manual. Teams are stuck testing on personal devices, struggling to cover real-world scenarios, and losing entire weeks just to prep a release.

Worse, thorough testing often means cutting releases a week in advance just to catch bugs before submitting to the app stores.

### Big Tech & Startups

[### Meta is reportedly working on humanoid robots that help with chores (3 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-is-reportedly-working-on-humanoid-robots-that-help-with-chores-192453416.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta is reportedly creating a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division that will build robot hardware. The company's long-term goal is to create the platform that the industry uses. It will make the underlying sensors, AI, and software for other companies to put inside their hardware. The core technologies that Meta has invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to the development of the advancements needed for robotics.

[### Reddit CEO Says Paywalls Are Coming Soon (2 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/reddit-ceo-says-paywalls-are-coming-soon-2000564245?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Reddit's CEO Steve Huffman said during a video Ask Me Anything Session recently that the platform is actively testing ways to make some content paid. Reddit is planning to roll out a 'paid subreddit' feature later this year. The paid content model is still a work in progress - there are many issues to work out, such as how paid subreddits will be moderated, as volunteer moderators likely won't want to watch over paid content if they aren't getting paid themselves. It may be possible for Reddit to allow creators to put certain content behind paywalls - lots of creators have their own subreddits, which allow community conversation in a way that comments on Patreon posts don't totally allow for.

[### Miniaturized CRISPR Packs a Mighty Gene Editing Punch (5 minute read)](https://singularityhub.com/2025/02/14/miniaturized-crispr-packs-a-mighty-gene-editing-punch/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

One of the biggest issues with CRISPR-Cas9 is that the system is too large, making it difficult to deliver the gene editor. Mammoth Biosciences' NanoCas is a version of the CRISPR-Cas9 system that is roughly one-third the size of the original, allowing the tool to be used for gene therapy inside muscles, the brain, the heart, and other tissues. The team is already exploring the system's potential for targeting brain diseases. The technology could be modified for use in epigenetic or base editing.
