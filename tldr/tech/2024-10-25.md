OpenAI plans to launch its next frontier model, Orion, by December. The model has been teased by an OpenAI executive as potentially up to 100 times more powerful than GPT-4. Orion will initially be released to companies that OpenAI works closely with so they can build their own products and features. Engineers inside Microsoft are preparing to host the model on Azure as early as November. It is unclear if OpenAI will call the model GPT-5, despite it being seen internally as GPT-4's successor.

[### TSMC's Arizona Chip Production Yields Surpass Taiwan's in Win for US Push (3 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-24/tsmc-s-arizona-chip-production-yields-surpass-taiwan-s-a-win-for-us-push?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyOTgzMDExOSwiZXhwIjoxNzMwNDM0OTE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTTFRTODlUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.PLKspxac5LtsWqeVAHUyInvC-yO8VcFVgDTcantJkBI&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) has achieved early production yields at its first plant in Arizona that surpasses similar factories back home. The share of chips manufactured at the facility that are usable is about four percentage points higher than comparable facilities in Taiwan. The yield is critical as it determines whether companies will be able to cover the enormous costs of a chip plant. The accomplishment is a sign of progress for US efforts to revitalize local semiconductor manufacturing.

Scientists appear to be on the verge of unlocking commercial fusion. The technology would be a major inflection point if it can be deployed at scale as it unlocks limitless, cheap energy. This would significantly threaten the fossil fuel industry. As a major oil exporter, the United Arab Emirates is not ignoring or undermining the technology - it is investing in it, exploring how to secure access to crucial fuels, and embedding itself into the fusion supply chain.

[### How Intel Got Left Behind in the A.I. Chip Boom (10 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/technology/intel-ai-chips-mistakes.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.08OJ.SCT6kgtDjvcz&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The story of how Intel got left behind in AI is representative of the broader challenges the company now faces. The company missed opportunities, made wayward decisions, and executed poorly. The trail of missteps was a byproduct of a corporate culture born of decades of success and high profits that was hard-changing and focused on its franchise in personal computers and later in data centers. Its corporate ethos worked against it as the company tried and failed repeatedly to become a leader in chips for artificial intelligence.
