[### The Game Theory of How Algorithms Can Drive Up Prices (9 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-game-theory-of-how-algorithms-can-drive-up-prices-20251022/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Intentional price-fixing through collusion has long been illegal. Sellers are increasingly relying on algorithms that repeatedly adjust prices in response to new data about the state of the market. It is much harder to ensure these algorithms set fair prices as there is no explicit collusion. Algorithms can collude tacitly even when not programmed to do so. One way to fix this problem is to ban all pricing algorithms except the no-swap-regret algorithms that game theorists favor. There are methods for checking if an algorithm has a no-swap-regret property without looking at its code, so there are practical ways of enforcing this idea.

[### A single DNS race condition brought Amazon's cloud empire to its knees (4 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/23/amazon_outage_postmortem/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon has published a detailed postmortem that explains the recent day-long outage that disrupted major websites and services. The root cause was a race condition in DynamoDB's automated DNS management system that left an empty DNS record for the service's regional endpoint. The race condition occurred when one DNS Enactor experienced 'unusually high delays' while the DNS Planner continued generating new plans. AWS has disabled the DynamoDB DNS Planner and DNS Enactor automation worldwide until safeguards are put in place.

[### Reasoning Is Not Model Improvement (10 minute read)](https://manidoraisamy.com/reasoning-not-ai.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The AI coding tool market is scaling explosively, with all the companies betting on the assumption that models will keep getting better at generating code. The entire market becomes a house of cards if that assumption is wrong. However, whoever solves the architecture problem wins everything. Even modest fundamental improvements would cascade through the entire ecosystem. The question is whether any lab will prioritize the hard path of fixing the foundation over the easy path of building apps.

If you're competent and you put some amount of effort into demonstrating that competence, you can free yourself from the world of recruiters. If you can generate even half of what you need to live by yourself, you've doubled the amount of time you'll survive without conventional employment. Sales is just looking at someone's problem and giving them a quote for fixing it. Being in control of your work means being able to tell customers they aren't a good fit.
