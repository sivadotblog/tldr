[### Blue Origin aims to land next New Glenn booster, then reuse it for Moon mission (10 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/blue-origin-aims-to-land-next-new-glenn-booster-then-reuse-it-for-moon-mission/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The second launch of Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket will send two NASA-funded satellites toward Mars to study the processes that drove the planet's evolution from a warmer, wetter world to the cold, dry planet of today. A successful launch would nudge Blue Origin closer to winning certification from the Space Force to begin launching national security satellites. The company plans to recover the New Glenn rocket's first stage booster during the mission.

[### OpenAI's Sora soars to No. 3 on the US App Store (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/openais-sora-soars-to-no-3-on-the-u-s-app-store/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's Sora app saw 56,000 downloads on its first day. It is now ranked third Top Overall app on the US App Store, despite being invite-only and limited to users in the US and Canada. The ChatGPT app and Google's Gemini iOS apps had stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one, but since Sora is invite-only, that may not be a fair comparison. The strong release indicates there is a demand for AI video tools with a social networking-like experience.

The Earth BioGenome Project (EBP) aims to obtain a genome sequence for every named species of eukaryotic organism on the planet by 2035. Its success will depend on researchers' ability to scale several biotech technologies. Specialists on the front lines of the genomic revolution in biology are confident that such scaling will be possible. Having a genome sequence for every eukaryotic creature will give researchers insights into how evolution proceeded for a myriad of life forms. It could lead to the discovery and development of many drugs, enzymes, catalysts, and other chemicals of incalculable value.

[### Where It's at:// (17 minute read)](https://overreacted.io/where-its-at/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

All servers speaking the AT protocol are part of 'the atmosphere', a web of hyperlinked JSON. Each piece of JSON in the atmosphere has its own at://URI. This post looks at the exact process of resolving an at:// URI. The AT protocol is fundamentally an abstraction over HTTP, DNS, and JSON. It turns the web into a place where content belongs to its creators, not to the apps that display it, by putting users in an authority position, separating identity from hosting, and making data portable.

[### Asked to do something illegal at work? Here's what these software engineers did (14 minute read)](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/asked-to-do-something-illegal-at-work/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nishad Singh had confirmation that something illegal was happening at FTX, but he stayed, and now he is facing up to 75 years in jail. A senior engineering member at Pollen is now at the mercy of the UK police with what could be a potential wire fraud case after being asked to run a script that double-charged customers (and then doing so). The Director of Engineering at Frank, a student loan startup, flat out refused to create a fake set of data to pump up customer numbers. Their refusal is what makes them the only example on this list that is totally legally safe.

Many tech companies are saying that good help is hard to find. While there is an ample supply of eager and capable engineers for hire, employers say there aren't enough people with the most in-demand skills. Companies are looking for AI-specific experience, but relatively few people have it because the technology is so new. Companies should focus on identifying candidates with transferable skills and let those people learn on the job.

Meta has added a new review process for academic papers, sparking internal anger. Yann LeCun, a Turing Award winner and a pivotal figure in modern AI, reportedly considered resigning over the change. The new policy is aimed at aligning pure research more closely with Meta's product road map. It will also help mitigate potential reputational risks from controversial findings. The constant state of reorganization raises critical questions about whether Meta is able to turn its recently acquired assets into a dominant force.
