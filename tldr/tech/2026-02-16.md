[### OpenClaw, OpenAI, and the future (3 minute read)](https://steipete.me/posts/2026/openclaw?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger is joining OpenAI to work on bringing agents to everyone. OpenClaw will move to a foundation and stay open and independent. While Steinberger sees the potential in OpenClaw becoming a huge company, he doesn't find the prospect appealing and would rather change the world with OpenAI.

CapCut users will soon have access to Seedance 2.0, ByteDance's latest AI video generation model. The model is already available to users on the Chinese version of CapCut, Jianying. It can generate coherent story lines, create realistic voice-overs and background sounds, and generate complex character actions. Seedance 2.0 can currently only generate videos of up to 15 seconds. It generated some controversy on launch, with critics raising privacy and copyright concerns.

[### Tiny, 45 base long RNA can make copies of itself (8 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/researchers-find-small-rnas-that-can-make-copies-of-themselves/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

One of the key steps in the origin of life is the emergence of an RNA molecule that could replicate itself. RNA can carry genetic information and also fold into three-dimensional structures that act as catalysts. This suggests that early life was protein-free, with RNA handling heredity and catalyzing a simple metabolism. A team of scientists has discovered a 45-base-long piece of RNA that can make copies of itself, adding to our knowledge of the conditions in which life emerged.

[### Fusion startup Helion hits blistering temps as it races toward 2028 deadline (6 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/fusion-startup-helion-hits-blistering-temps-as-it-races-toward-2028-deadline/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Fusion energy startup Helion has hit a key milestone: plasma inside its Polaris prototype reactor has reached 150 million degrees Celsius. The company's ultimate goal is to produce plasmas that hit 200 degrees Celsius. Its reactor design is different from its competitors, requiring plasmas about twice as hot to function as intended. Helion plans to extract energy using the fusion reaction's magnetic field rather than from heat. The company is contracted to sell electricity to Microsoft starting in 2028, but this will be through a larger commercial reactor called Orion, which is currently being built.

[### Bias Toward Action (17 minute read)](https://addyosmani.com/blog/bias-towards-action/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Bias toward action is defaulting to the smallest responsible step that produces real feedback while pre-committing to guardrails. It helps companies learn faster while making sure that being wrong doesn't kill them. It's about optimizing for learning speed while investing in foundations that make you faster. Fast teams use a lot of information, but they don't wait for perfect information. Their tight feedback loops allow them to learn quickly.

[### On cognitive debt (6 minute read)](https://www.natemeyvis.com/on-cognitive-debt/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cognitive debt is the idea that AI-generated codebases are at risk of falling into a state where nobody knows how they work, leaving them inextensible, unobservable, and hard to debug. This is already happening in AI-driven codebases. However, when controlling for the size and scope of a project, cognitive debt tends to be at least as bad, if not worse, in pre-AI code bases than in AI code bases. This fact is obscured because a lot of traditional engineering work is either managing crippling cognitive debt or avoiding it at enormous cost. The best AI users are already pretty good at avoiding cognitive debt, and they're only going to get better at it.

Companies that don't rebuild how they work from first principles will get outshipped by teams half their size six months from now. Engineering teams need to throw out the playbook and write a new one for the age of AI. This post discusses one startup's new playbook, which puts agents first as the primary users who do the work. The engineer's role in the framework is to make sure the agents can do the work well.

[### Meta Plans to Add Facial Recognition Technology to Its Smart Glasses (9 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/technology/meta-facial-recognition-smart-glasses.html?unlocked_article_code=1.MlA.p88a.oDjzFiUmdIG8&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta plans to add facial recognition to its Ray-Ban smart glasses later this year. Its 'Name Tag' feature will let wearers identify people and get information about them via the company's AI assistant. The company considered adding facial recognition to the first version of the glasses in 2021, but pulled back over technical challenges and ethical concerns. Meta plans to first release Name Tag to attendees at a conference for the blind before making it available to the general public.
