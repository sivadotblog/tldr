[### The next version of Stable Diffusion won't produce spaghetti hands (2 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/the-next-version-of-stable-diffusion-wont-produce-spaghetti-hands-171552952.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SDXL 0.9, the next version of Stable Diffusion, produces massively improved image and composition detail over its predecessors. The model is able to produce more convincing hands. Running the model requires a minimum of 16GB of RAM and a GeForce RTX 20 or higher graphics card with 8GB of VRAM. SDXL 0.9 will be available soon on Stability AI's Clipdrop web tool and Dream Studio. The open-source version of SDXL 1.0 will be released in mid-July.

[### An AT&T-backed cellular satellite company sent a 4G LTE signal from space (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768495/att-ast-spacemobile-space-based-satellite-cellular-signal-lte-5g?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While the FCC is still working to develop legal frameworks for space-based cell services, several companies are already working on technologies to send data down from space. AST SpaceMobile recently managed to transmit a 4G LTE signal from space that was picked up by an ordinary smartphone. The signal, which was beamed from low Earth orbit, reached speeds of up to 10.3Mbps. AST's next major test will be to try a 5G connection from space.

[### Microsoft milestone brings it a bit closer to quantum supercomputer (3 minute read)](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/microsoft-quantum-supercomputer-majorana-particle-breakthrough?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft claims it achieved a breakthrough in fundamental physics by demonstrating the ability to create and control Majorana quasiparticles. Majorana quasiparticles are a stable but elusive particle that has properties that could lead to fewer errors in quantum computing. The breakthrough signifies the completion of the first of a six-step plan to creating a quantum computer. Microsoft's next step will be to work on hardware-protected qubits that will eventually lead to a resilient quantum system. The company believes that it will take less than 10 years for it to build a quantum supercomputer.

Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have agreed to a cage match. The feud between the tech billionaires started nearly seven years ago when a satellite that Facebook leased was destroyed during launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Facebook had leased bandwidth on the satellite to provide some areas of Africa with internet access to Facebook.
