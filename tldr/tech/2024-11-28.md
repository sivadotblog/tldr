The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has opened an investigation into whether Microsoft has violated antitrust law. The agency recently sent a formal request for information to Microsoft asking about its cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity products. The FTC is particularly interested in how the company bundles its cloud computing offerings with office and security products and the company's growing power in the artificial intelligence space. Regulators in the European Union said earlier this year that Microsoft had violated antitrust rules when it packaged Teams with Office tools like Excel and Word.

[### Diamond optical discs could store data for millions of years (4 minute read)](https://www.popsci.com/science/diamond-optical-discs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese researchers have achieved a record-breaking diamond storage density of 1.85 terabytes per cubic centimeter. The diamonds are able to retain data for millions of years at room temperature without requiring any maintenance. The system currently requires complex lasers, imaging cameras, and other equipment, but the researchers believe they will be able to eventually fit everything inside a microwave oven-sized device. The technology will be particularly useful for governments, research facilities, and large libraries.

Google's AI products may be restricted as a remedy following the government's win in the search monopoly trial.
