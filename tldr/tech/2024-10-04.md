[### Inside Elon Musk's AI party at OpenAI's old headquarters (8 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24261160/elon-musk-xai-recruiting-party-openai-dev-day-sam-altman?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk laid out his vision to beat closed, for-profit AI during a recruitment party for xAI held the same day OpenAI was hosting its annual Dev Day across town. Musk had co-founded OpenAI with Sam Altman and a group of partners in 2015, but he quit the board three years later due to a potential future conflict with Tesla's focus on AI and disagreements with the OpenAI team. He founded xAI to create a digital superintelligence, assembling a team drawn from his other companies. This article takes a look at what happened at the recruitment party, where Musk called on developers to join the company to help build the intelligence and applications derived from that intelligence.

[### NASA is working on a plan to replace its space station, but time is running out (11 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/is-nasas-commercial-space-station-program-doomed/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NASA will finalize a strategy for its operations in low-Earth orbit after 2030 over the next several months. It will award contracts to one or more private companies to develop small space stations towards the end of next year. These space stations will make NASA and other space agencies customers rather than operators. The plans are still developing and there are still many questions left unanswered, such as whether NASA really needs to continue having a presence in low-Earth orbit at all.

[### CERN Confirms Ultra-Rare Particle Transformation, Hints at New Physics (5 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/cern-confirms-ultra-rare-particle-transformation-hints-at-new-physics?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at CERN have established, experimentally observed, and measured the decay of a charged kaon particle into a charged pion and a neutrino-antineutrino pair. This specific kind of decay is incredibly rare but well predicted by the complex mathematics making up the Standard Model of physics. Its rarity and precision makes it a highly sensitive gauge for detecting new physics.

[### Pay for job changers rose at the slowest pace in more than 3 years (3 minute read)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pay-for-job-changers-rose-at-the-slowest-pace-in-more-than-3-years-151346370.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The median year-over-year pay increase for job switchers has fallen and is now at its lowest growth rate since April 2021. The gap between pay gains for job changers and job stayers is at its narrowest since January and a far cry from the levels seen during the 2022-2023 'Great Resignation'. This indicates that the labor market is currently less dynamic. The slowdown could characterize the labor market data for the rest of 2024 as quits and layoffs remain low.

[### Solving the Maker-Taker problem (6 minute read)](https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The imbalance between major contributors and those who contribute minimally harms open source communities. This, along with a lack of an environment that supports the fair coexistence of open source businesses, could discourage entrepreneurs from starting open source businesses, which could harm the future of open source. Solving these challenges by creating a more equitable and sustainable open source ecosystem would help strengthen the future of open source.
