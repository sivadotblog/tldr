[### Apple is snapping up one of the best non-Adobe image editors, Pixelmator (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/apple-is-acquiring-image-editing-firm-pixelmator/#gsc.tab=0?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is acquiring Pixelmator, a Lithuanian firm that makes popular Mac-based photo editing tools, pending regulatory approval. Regulatory approval may be an issue - several large companies have had to abandon deals due to opposition from EU regulators. It is unknown whether Apple intends to integrate Pixelmator's features into its own apps or allow the apps to remain separate standalone apps. Pixelmator Pro recently introduced a number of AI and ML tools for adjusting photos and creating masks, vector tools, and support for more RAW photo formats and other design tool files.

SpaceX will attempt to transfer propellant from one orbiting Starship to another as early as next March. The capability will enable an uncrewed landing demonstration of a Starship on the moon. A crewed landing is currently scheduled for September 2026. SpaceX recently made history when it caught the Super Heavy rocket booster in mid-air using 'chopsticks' attached to the launch tower.

[### Semaglutide So Effective at Treating Arthritis That Patients Were ‚ÄúMore or Less Were Treated Out of the Study‚Äù (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/neoscope/semaglutide-arthritis-study-success?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A trial testing semaglutide on patients with knee osteoarthritis conducted in 11 countries found that the drug was so effective at treating the condition the participants no longer needed treatment by the end of the experiment. The study involved 400 obese patients who experienced pain when walking. The patients who received the drug lost weight, felt significantly less pain, and experienced more ease of everyday mobility compared to patients who received a placebo. Many of the improvements were due to taking weight off the affected knees, but the researchers think that semaglutide's anti-inflammatory effects also played a role.

Designers are reintroducing buttons to their products. This 're-buttonization' could be a response to everything becoming a touchscreen. People like physical buttons because they don't have to look at them and they offer a greater range of tactility and feedback. This article contains an interview with Rachel Plotnick, an associate professor of Cinema and Media Studies at Indiana University in Bloomington, where she discusses the history of buttons, the rise of touchscreens, the shift back to buttons and physical controls, and more.

It can help create special effects that would otherwise require hundreds of VFX artists, tens of millions of dollars, and months of post-production work in just minutes. AI has the potential to disrupt many aspects of the film industry. This article takes a look at how some filmmakers are using AI to create movies and discusses the impact that AI will have on movie-making.
