[### ‚ÄòWe have made science fiction come true!‚Äô Scientists prove particles in a quantum system can be rejuvenated (5 minute read)](https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-02-22/we-have-made-science-fiction-come-true-scientists-prove-particles-in-a-quantum-system-can-be-rejuvenated.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An Austrian and Spanish team have demonstrated that a process can be ‚Äòrewound‚Äô to restore the components of an atom to their previous state. The team published papers proving that it is possible to accelerate, decelerate, and reverse the flow of time within quantum systems. These physical processes have the same effect on all particles, regardless of their nature and interactions. The finding is not a time machine, as time passes regardless. If a particle is to be reverted to its state from five minutes ago, the process will take that same amount of time.

[### Augmented reality headset enables users to see hidden objects (6 minute read)](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/981015?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

MIT researchers have developed an augmented reality headset that gives the wearer X-ray vision. X-AR uses computer vision and wireless perception to locate items that are hidden from view. It sends out RF signals, which can penetrate common materials, and then guides the wearer to the item using an AR interface. When tested in a warehouse-like environment, X-AR could localize hidden items to within 9.8 centimeters. The technology has potential applications in e-commerce warehouses and manufacturing facilities.

[### Could deep boreholes solve our nuclear waste problem? (17 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/could-deep-boreholes-solve-our-nuclear-waste-problem/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Deep boreholes are an alternative to underground mines for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. This method has lower costs and environmental impact and would eliminate the need to transport spent fuel across the country. Each nuclear plant could have its own disposal borehole. While the capacity of boreholes is limited and some larger waste items would not fit, deep boreholes are still a viable solution for compact waste and spent fuel and could be a beneficial alternative to mined repositories.
