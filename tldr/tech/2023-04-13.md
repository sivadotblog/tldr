[### OpenAI looks beyond diffusion with ‚Äòconsistency‚Äô based image generator (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/openai-looks-beyond-diffusion-with-consistency-based-image-generator/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's consistency models can do simple tasks an order of magnitude faster than image generation models like DALL-E. While diffusion models learn how to gradually subtract noise from a starting image made entirely of noise, consistency models are trained to take an image at any level of obscuration and generate a complete source image in just one step. They don't make very good images yet, but the technique demonstrates how it is possible to efficiently generate images for next-generation use cases. Examples of pictures generated with consistency models are available in the article.

[### Europe is about to launch one of its most ambitious missions ever (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/europe-is-about-to-launch-one-of-its-most-ambitious-missions-ever/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The European Space Agency is launching a large probe to Jupiter to study its moons. The Jupiter Ice Moons Explorer (JUICE) is the largest deep space mission launched by the ESA. It cost the agency 1.5 billion euros. JUICE will fly by the Earth and Venus several times to build up the energy required to reach Jupiter. It aims to enter Jupiter's orbit in 2031. JUICE will orbit around Jupiter until 2034, when it is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede. A link to the livestream of the launch, which is scheduled for 8:15 am EDT, is available in the article.

[### Ageing studies in five animals suggests how to reverse decline (4 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01040-x?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A study has found that aging seems to affect cellular processes in the same way across humans, fruit flies, rats, mice, and worms. A variety of molecular processes become less reliable as organisms age. Gene mutations become more frequent, chromosomes get shorter, and transcription becomes more error-prone. The study's findings open up the possibility of developing drugs that target these factors to slow down the aging process.

[### Mass Layoffs and Absentee Bosses Create a Morale Crisis at Meta (9 minute read)](https://archive.ph/3Vzw0?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta's 'year of efficiency' has so far translated into mass layoffs. There have been two rounds of cuts over the past six months, with two more to come that will eliminate over 21,000 positions. Some of Meta's top executives have moved away and are managing large parts of the company from London and Tel Aviv. There is increased scrutiny in workplace reviews and workers are being asked to justify why their jobs are crucial to Meta's goals. Workers are creating memes about how much time they have left in the company.
