A new 'right to disconnect' proposition introduced in California, if passed, would make employers in California lay out exactly what a person's hours are and ensure that they aren't required to respond to work-related communications while off the clock. There are exceptions for emergencies and salaried employees may have periods in which they may have to work longer hours. Companies would be fined a minimum of $100 for wrongdoing. It is unclear how much support exists for the bill, which follows similar legislation in other countries.
