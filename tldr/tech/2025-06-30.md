[### After 21 years, Basecamp remains the most refreshingly straightforward way to manage projects (Sponsor)](https://basecamp.com/?utm_campaign=sponsorship&amp;utm_medium=digital&amp;&amp;utm_source=tldr)

There's big investor money in project management. That's a big incentive to make bloated, barely-useable products ‚Äî designed to tick boxes in a procurement manager's checklist.

[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/?utm_campaign=sponsorship&utm_medium=digital&&utm_source=tldr) has been bucking this trend for more than two decades. It's famously [no-nonsense, effective, and reliable](https://basecamp.com/?utm_campaign=sponsorship&utm_medium=digital&&utm_source=tldr). It's designed for smaller, hungrier businesses who just need to get things done.

And it's still going strong ‚Äî without spending hundreds of millions of VC dollars on marketing.

No superbowl ads. No tacked-on AI.

Just the features you need to manage projects ‚Äî from chat (bye bye Slack) to Kanban to docs.

[### It's Known as ‚ÄòThe List'‚Äîand It's a Secret File of AI Geniuses (15 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-ai-recruiting-mark-zuckerberg-openai-018ed7fc?st=benvvx&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mark Zuckerberg has spent months putting together a list of the most talented engineers and researchers in artificial intelligence. Recruits on the list typically have PhDs from elite schools and work experience at places like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. Their specialized knowledge is the key to cashing in on the artificial intelligence revolution. Many of the candidates have taken meetings at Zuckerberg's homes in Palo Alto and Lake Tahoe. This article looks at some of the people on the list.

[### Tesla says it made its first driverless delivery of a new car to a customer (8 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/28/tesla-first-driverless-delivery-new-car-to-customer.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla routed a Model Y SUV from its Austin, Texas, Gigafactory to an apartment building in the area on June 27 - its first driverless delivery of a new car to a customer. The vehicle transversed public roads, including highways, without a human in the driver's seat or front passenger seat. Tesla did not say which version of its software and hardware the vehicle had, but the company's Head of AI said that the vehicle was exactly the same as every Model Y produced in the Tesla factory. A video of the Model Y completing the delivery is available in the article.

[### 7 People Now Have Elon Musk's Neuralink Brain Implant (6 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/7-people-now-have-elon-musks-neuralink-brain-implant?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Neuralink has increased the number of patients with its N1 brain implant to seven. The implant allows those with cervical spinal cord injuries or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to control a computer with their thoughts. Six of the seven are participating in a study aimed at proving that the N1 implant, R1 surgical robot, and N1 User App are safe and effective. The implant has enabled some of the patients to work to help provide for themselves and their families financially.

[### Scientists Launch Wild New Project to Build a Human Genome From Scratch (4 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/scientists-launch-wild-new-project-to-build-a-human-genome-from-scratch-2000620762?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Synthetic Human Genome Project aims to write artificial human DNA from scratch - the scientists behind the project are hoping that it will answer fundamental questions about the human genome and transform our understanding of health and disease. The technology could be used to create new medical treatments like designer cell-based therapies and virus-resistant tissue transplantation. The research team hopes to be able to create the foundational tools, technologies, and methods to allow researchers to create genomes from scratch over the next half-decade. The project runs along a parallel research effort into the social and ethical issues of creating human genomes in a lab.

vet is a command-line tool that acts as a safety net for the risky curl | bash pattern. It lets users inspect, diff against previous versions, and lint remote scripts before asking for explicit approval to execute. vet is a safer, more transparent way to handle remote code execution.

[### Sirius (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/sirius-db/sirius?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sirius is a GPU-native SQL engine that plugs into existing databases such as DuckDB via the standard Substrait query format without requiring any query rewrites or major system changes. It currently supports DuckDB and Doris, with support for other systems coming soon. Sirius is under active development and several features are still in progress. Its current limitations include data size limitations, row count limitations, data type coverage, operator coverage, and a lack of support for partially NULL columns.

[### Trump says he has 'a group of very wealthy people' to buy TikTok (2 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20nqdl5ydjo?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

President Donald Trump says he has a group of buyers willing to acquire TikTok. A sale would need approval from the Chinese government, but Trump has told the media that President Xi Jinping 'will probably do it'. It is unclear whether the current buyer is the same as the one from three months ago - the deal fell apart in April due to a disagreement on tariffs. The US Congress passed a law forcing TikTok's sale in April last year, but the deadline for the sale has been repeatedly delayed.
