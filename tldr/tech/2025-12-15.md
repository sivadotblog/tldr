[### AI agents are microservices (Sponsor)](https://umami-production-286d.up.railway.app/q/u3IHQpbPT)

When AI becomes part of your software stack, you need more than agentic DAG. You need an [AI backend](https://agentfield.ai/blog/posts/ai-backend/?utm_campaign=product_launch&utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_id=tldr-1&utm_content=blog-cta) that treats agents like microservices — distributed, observable, and governable.

[AgentField](https://agentfield.ai/docs/?utm_campaign=product_launch&utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_id=tldr-1&utm_content=docs-cta) is open-source infrastructure for production AI: REST APIs, async execution, built-in memory, and cryptographic agent identity with automatic audit trails.

Think Kubernetes for agents: a control plane where you build AI like you build software.

The Netflix House is a new permanent brand activation/movie theater/retail outlet designed to extend the lives of Netflix's most popular shows. They will enable fans of shows to experience more of a franchise in real life. The company has already opened a Netflix House location at the King of Prussia mall in the Philadelphia suburbs and a second at the former Belk department store, which anchors the Galleria Dallas mall in Texas. It plans to open a third location at BLVD Las Vegas in 2027.

[### What happened to Quantified Self? (2 minute read)](https://www.natemeyvis.com/what-happened-to-quantified-self/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Quantified Self movement has largely fizzled out. It's not easy to collect data about yourself, and it's hard to make real use of it. There's also a cost to building vast data profiles of yourself that people may want to avoid. People still track their data, just not as a larger self-quantification project.

[### If a Meta AI model can read a brain-wide signal, why wouldn't the brain? (15 minute read)](https://1393.xyz/writing/if-a-meta-ai-model-can-read-a-brain-wide-signal-why-wouldnt-the-brain?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Our brains are able to both detect and produce magnetic fields. Researchers at Meta were able to decode the brain's magnetic fields into actual images and words by training models on public datasets. This opens up the possibility that the brain may be able to read and write its own field. This article explores the idea and how it could relate to consciousness.

[### Design is search (6 minute read)](https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/1999730838280503775?s=12&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Design is like a search, not a production pipeline. The design process is valuable. Early design needs freedom, but later design needs reality. You might ship faster when you collapse these phases, but you lose a lot in the process. New technology makes it faster to build, but that's not what design is really about.

The ultrawealthy buy shares of the most in-demand companies via invite-only transactions long before the shares are listed on public stock exchanges. This small, privileged group can obtain shares of companies still in their early growth stages, while the rest are left with older, slower-growing names. This dynamic is exacerbating the wealth disparity in the US. It could even become an existential threat to the US economy.

[### Apple loses its appeal of a scathing contempt ruling in iOS payments case (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/epic-celebrates-the-end-of-the-apple-tax-after-appeals-court-win-in-ios-payments-case/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple was found to be in willful violation of a 2021 injunction intended to open up iOS App Store Payments in April. That contempt of court finding has now been almost entirely upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Apple may still be able to charge a 'reasonable fee' for payments made outside its App Store based on actual costs to ensure user security and privacy. The ruling means that there will likely soon be rapid adoption of outside payment processors.
