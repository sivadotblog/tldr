Tesla won its fight over Elon Musk's record-breaking pay package approved by shareholders in 2018. The Delaware Supreme Court said the lower court's ruling would have deprived Musk of compensation for several years of work, so he should get the full pay package. Musk's 2018 stock options have grown in value to $139 billion. It was initially valued at more than $2.3 billion, already shattering previous compensation records.

Sam Altman recently appeared on Big Technology Podcast to discuss OpenAI's strategy to win, where the product lineup is going in the coming year, how OpenAI's over $1 trillion in AI infrastructure commitments make sense, and the company's future plans for AI devices and AI cloud. The strategy to keep OpenAI ahead involves getting people to use its products, keeping them there with the best models, serving the use cases they want with reliable compute, then expanding into areas like enterprise and hardware. The full conversation, along with links to the audio, is available in the article.

The Trump administration launched a partnership in October to build at least $80 billion worth of new, large-scale nuclear reactors. The money will support the construction of a type of pressurized water reactor developed by Westinghouse that can generate about 1,110 megawatts of electric power. The partnership includes profit-sharing mechanisms that will give the US government some of the upside if the initiative succeeds.

[### Ex-ASML workers reverse-engineered state of the art chipmaking machines to get China far closer than previously thought to independence from foreign tech (6 minute read)](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/ex-asml-workers-reverse-engineered-state-of-the-art-chipmaking-machines-to-get-china-far-closer-than-previously-thought-to-independence-from-foreign-tech/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

[### Design is more than code (9 minute read)](https://linear.app/now/design-is-more-than-code?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Design is about finding the right problem, the right intent, and the right vision. The features you design and build today should be considered a step toward that vision. Without the right context and goal, you could be iterating toward a direction that wasn't chosen intentionally. The industry is not very patient, but that doesn't mean you should devalue the why behind your designs in favor of output.

[### The Big-O Complexity of Vibe Coders (4 minute read)](https://www.shiveesh.com/thoughts-and-ideas/the-big-o-complexity-of-vibe-coders?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Efficiency becoming a metric will create pressure and cause exploration to look wasteful. High-token sessions will start to look sloppy. Over time, AI will turn into another optimization target, and eventually into something that people virtue signal about rather than something that reflects real impact. Some of the most valuable work exists in the messy, high-token exploratory phase that resists easy measurement.

[### Ellison's Hardball Warner Bros. Tactics Gave Netflix an Opening (14 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-21/ellison-s-hardball-warner-bros-tactics-gave-netflix-an-opening?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjM3Njk0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzY2OTgxNzQ4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0o1RE1UOTZPU0cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMzZENUE5QzIxMDQ0NjU4OTFBMTc1MTVDRDNBQkZFNiJ9.BrLe9OxwmrnLmeuGVfZ3IiZN29hi9JMd8tH0gxFMp74&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Lawyers for David Ellison sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery on the night of December 3 expressing serious concerns about the fairness and adequacy of the company's sale process. This surprised Warner Bros., as the company believed it had run a fair process. Ellison's inner circle tried to retract the statement, claiming some partners didn't even know the letter was going out, but it was too late. In response, Warner Bros. decided to sell to Netflix.

[### Graphite Gets Bought By Cursor: Three Reflections from Six Years of Work (9 minute read)](https://hunterwalk.com/2025/12/19/graphite-gets-bought-by-cursor-three-reflections-from-six-years-of-work-pmf-didnt-happen-right-away-working-irl-mattered-three-founders-three-distinct-roles/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Software quality startup Graphite has been acquired by code generation startup Cursor. Graphite started out as Screenplay, which couldn't find product-market fit right away. The conversations around Graphite started right before the pandemic lockdowns. The team started working in person together as soon as it was advisable, allowing them to knit a culture early and build trust. The three founders took three distinct roles, and they all remain vital to the company.
