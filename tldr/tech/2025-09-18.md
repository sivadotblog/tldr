When the former Zillow exec who sold his first company for $120m starts a new venture, people notice. Thousands of people. In fact, 12,000+ regular investors have already joined the early investors behind Uber, eBay, and Venmo as Pacaso shareholders.

Disrupting the real estate industry once again, Pacaso's tech offers co-ownership of premier properties, revamping a $1.3T market.

[### Chinese Officials Urge Firms to Shun Nvidia AI Chip (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/china-nvidia-ai-chips-fbdbc30a?st=qxPeBp&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China's top cybersecurity regulator has urged big tech companies not to buy Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000 chip, a less-advanced AI chip that the US has allowed Nvidia to sell to Chinese customers. Domestic firms have been encouraged to switch to homegrown hardware. Some Chinese officials view the country's chips as strong alternatives to those Nvidia is allowed to sell in China. China has had trouble ramping up production of its best chips in part because its access to leading-edge components and chip-making equipment has been blocked by the US.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### AI-Designed Phages (19 minute read)](https://www.asimov.press/p/ai-phages?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Arc Institute and Stanford University researchers have created the first viable genomes using generative AI. They created 16 bacteriophages using fine-tuned versions of both Evo 1 and Evo 2, models freely available on Hugging Face. Their work offers a blueprint for the design of diverse synthetic bacteriophages and lays a foundation for the generative design of useful living systems at the genome scale. The research may present some risks, but at the moment, using AI to make synthetic genomes costs a great deal at both the design and construction stages and isn't viable for most companies.

[### Axiom Space aims for orbit with its Orbital Data Center Node (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/17/axiom_space_aims_for_orbit/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Axiom Space plans to launch two Axiom Orbital Data Center (AxODC) Nodes by the end of 2025, with at least three running by the end of 2027. The nodes will increase computing capacity on the International Space Station. Even if Axiom manages to get the hardware installed in the ISS in the next few years, the complex is due for deorbit by 2030. The company last year published optimistic plans to make its own space station by 2028.

5+ separate tools for IT and security management is way too many. [Electric](https://try.electric.ai/learn?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paid_affiliate&utm_campaign=250918_mkt_tldr_tech_secondary_incentive) consolidates everything - device management, security policies, employee onboarding -into one platform built specifically for smaller teams. Automated remediation, built-in integrations with your HR tools, and no technical expertise required.

[### Boring is good (8 minute read)](https://jenson.org/boring/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Most companies that have tried to implement AI technology have yet to see a positive outcome. Large language models are not intelligent, and they will never be. They aren't good at doing 'intelligent things' and replacing human tasks is far more complex than originally thought. There may be other potential uses for this technology, but the current approach is failing, and something has to change.

[### UUIDv47 (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/stateless-me/uuidv47?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

UUIDv47 lets users store sortable UUIDv7 in their databases while emitting a UUIDv4-looking facade at the API boundary. UUIDv7 is time-ordered and is better for index locality and pagination. The facade is indistinguishable from v4, providing security.

[### Inside the Apple audio lab where AirPods are tested and tuned (8 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/audio/inside-the-apple-audio-lab-where-airpods-are-tested-and-tuned-150025891.html?src=rss&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple uses a collection of audio metric booths to help correct and calibrate the AirPods' fit for natural variations in ear geometry. Its engineers use devices seen in audiologists' offices to help validate the company's claims of a clinical-grade hearing test. This allows AirPods users to set up their devices as a hearing aid at home and also creates an accurate hearing profile so users can hear music the way it was intended. This article takes a look at the labs where Apple tests and tunes its AirPods, which show how important sound is to everything Apple builds.
