[### Microsoft could offer private ChatGPT to businesses for ‚Äú10 times‚Äù the normal cost (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/report-microsoft-plans-privacy-first-chatgpt-for-businesses-with-secrets-to-keep/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft is planning to offer a privacy-focused version of ChatGPT to organizations concerned about data leaks and regulatory compliance. The product would run ChatGPT on dedicated servers and keep sensitive data from being used to train language models. It could cost as much as 10 times what customers currently pay to use ChatGPT. OpenAI is also planning a similar product. Microsoft's deal allows it to resell OpenAI's products, leading to both companies competing for some of the same users.

[### Gene therapy reverses vision loss in primates ‚Äî by making their eyes young again (3 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/health/gene-therapy-naion?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from Harvard Medical School and Life Biosciences have developed a gene therapy that can reverse vision loss in primate models of NAION, a condition caused by decreased blood flow to the optic nerve that results in sudden, significant, and usually permanent loss of vision in the eye. The treatment made the primate models' eye cells young again. It reprograms cells back to a time after they became specialized adult cells, but before age led to any unwanted epigenetic changes. Similar techniques have been used to extend the lives of old mice and restore sight in mouse models of glaucoma.

[### Rocket Lab hitting its stride with high cadence, new venture for Electron (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/rocket-lab-hitting-its-stride-with-high-cadence-new-venture-for-electron/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Rocket Lab recently announced a new venture that will see its Electron rocket being used as a testbed for hypersonic technologies. Electron will use essentially the same first and second stages, but it will have a modified kick stage that will allow it to deploy payloads with a mass of up to 600 kg into hypersonic trajectories five times greater than the speed of sound. Rocket Lab is able to offer this service due to its demonstrated ability to launch and build Electron rockets at a relatively high cadence. The company has as many as 15 launches planned for this year.

[### Jsonformer (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/1rgs/jsonformer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Getting language models to output structured JSON is hard. Jsonformer is a wrapper around HuggingFace models that fills in fixed tokens during generation and only delegates the generation of content tokens to the language model. It ensures that generated JSON is always syntactically correct and conforms to the specified schema. Jsonformer currently only supports a subset of JSON Schema - number, boolean, string, array, and object.

[### GPT makes learning fun again (11 minute read)](https://www.vipshek.com/blog/gpt-learning?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article compares GPT's chat interface with static learning resources like webpages or textbooks. GPT makes learning interactive. It provides answers tailored to the specific questions of the user. As users formulate the questions they ask, they are forced to reflect on what they're actually trying to learn, reinforcing their memory of what they're learning. Its progressive disclosure of information avoids overwhelming users with unnecessary information or complexity. It also uses fewer browser tabs and there are no ads or content marketing.
