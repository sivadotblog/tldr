[### OpenAI's long-rumored introduction of ads to ChatGPT just became a whole lot more concrete (2 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/16/chatgpt-ads/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI plans to start testing ads in the US for Free and Go tier users in the coming weeks. Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise users will not see ads. The Go tier is a new $8 per month subscription with access to GPT-5.2 Thinking. Ads will not influence the answers that ChatGPT provides and will always be separated and clearly labeled. Conversations will be kept private from advertisers. A screenshot of what the ads will look like is available in the article.

[### Musk Seeks Up to $134 Billion Damages From OpenAI, Microsoft (3 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-17/musk-seeks-up-to-134-billion-damages-from-openai-microsoft?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2ODc5OTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY5NDA0NDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOFpRWk9UOU5KTFUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIwOThFNzNDQTE5QTA0RDkxODEyQzQ4MjcwRDZERTI0QiJ9.vakJzY6dMlGWxQA6MoLJvS7mCE2_6A6dwLplJ8vctAE&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk wants OpenAI and Microsoft to pay him damages in the range of $79 billion to $134 billion as he claims OpenAI defrauded him by abandoning its nonprofit roots and partnering with Microsoft. The court filing says Musk is entitled to a chunk of OpenAI's current $500 billion valuation as he donated $38 million in seed money when he helped found the startup in 2015. Musk also plans to seek punitive damages and possibly an injunction. OpenAI claims the lawsuit is baseless and is aimed at harassment.

[### Going Founder Mode On Cancer (52 minute read)](https://centuryofbio.com/p/sid?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sid Sijbrandij, founder of GitLab, got the news that he had cancer on November 18, 2022. He underwent a brutal care regimen that involved surgical removal of his tumorous vertebrae and rounds of radiation and chemotherapy so intense that he required four blood transfusions to stay alive. After his cancer resurfaced in 2024, he decided to go 'founder mode' on his cancer, assembling a team to navigate his care journey. This article details the story of how he took charge of his health.

[### How Human Should Your Humanoid Be? (11 minute read)](https://itcanthink.substack.com/p/how-human-should-your-humanoid-be?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While the humanoid form factor is likely to stay due to its clear advantages, that doesn't mean that robots will still stay human. Boston Dynamics' Atlas is an interesting look at a very different vision of what a humanoid robot can and should be. Robots don't have to be limited to what evolution resulted in. They can be engineered to have capabilities that far exceed humans.

[### A Social Filesystem (42 minute read)](https://overreacted.io/a-social-filesystem/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Files represent personal creations, so they should live somewhere users control. File systems allow data to outlive the software used to create it. Other apps are able to open the same files to read or write data, and it's up to the users' choice on what app to use. This is analogous to how the AT protocol (the protocol behind Bluesky and other social apps) works.

[### Don't waste your back pressure (4 minute read)](https://banay.me/dont-waste-your-backpressure/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Agents have improved over the last year due to structures that provide them with automated feedback and allow them to work on longer-horizon tasks. This back pressure allows agents to identify mistakes, and the feedback helps them align on tasks for much longer. Developers should think about how to build back pressure into their workflows. Afterwards, they can loop agents until they have stamped out all of the inconsistencies and issues.
