Eli Lilly expects substantial demand when the new pill is launched.

[### If all the world were a monorepo (10 minute read)](https://jtibs.substack.com/p/if-all-the-world-were-a-monorepo?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

R's central package manager, CRAN, builds each package before publication, testing against a variety of R versions and operating systems. Even if a package passes tests against the full matrix of R versions and platforms, CRAN still reruns the tests for all of the packages that depend on that package. This means some packages can be blocked until dependent packages are upgraded. This approach, which clearly puts a burden on package developers, results in an excellent workflow for R's central user base, who want to spend as much time as possible on the details of data analysis, not stuck in transitive dependency hell.

Jack Ma is now back on Alibaba's campuses and is more directly involved than he's been in half a decade. He had resigned as chairman in 2019 and retreated from the public eye after a speech he made in 2020. The company has been run by two of Ma's longest-serving lieutenants, Joe Tsai and Eddie Wu, since 2023. Signs of Ma's influence can be seen in the company's pivot to artificial intelligence and its declaration of war on e-commerce foes JD and Meituan.
