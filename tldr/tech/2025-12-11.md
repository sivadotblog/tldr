Deepfakes now span image, voice, and video. They're flooding the internet and being used in sophisticated social engineering attacks. But detection tools are getting better as well.

[Resemble AI's DETECT-3B Omni](https://www.resemble.ai/detect-3b-omni/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=detect-3b-omni&utm_content=ai) is a multimodal AI model trained on 3 billion parameters to deliver unified deepfake protection across all content types. Released a few days ago, it's now the [leading deepfake detector on HuggingFace](https://www.resemble.ai/detect-3b-omni/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=detect-3b-omni&utm_content=ai), ranked #1 on Speech DeepFake Arena and DFBench with 94-99% accuracy rates.

[### Bezos and Musk Race to Bring Data Centers to Space (7 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/bezos-and-musk-race-to-bring-data-centers-to-space-faa486ee?st=9ncpXE&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Google are racing to figure out the viability of orbital data centers. Operating data centers in space will require overcoming several technical issues, including managing temperatures for hardware, protecting that hardware from radiation, and transferring data back to Earth without long lag times. Skeptics say that space-based data centers won't be competitive on cost. It may take tens of thousands of satellites to recreate the compute capacity of a gigawatt data center in space.

[### Meta's New AI Superstars Are Chafing Against the Rest of the Company (9 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/10/technology/meta-ai-tbd-lab-friction.html?unlocked_article_code=1.708._VYp.NYABqqerPqXx&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An us-versus-them mentality has emerged between Meta's top AI team and Mark Zuckerberg's longtime lieutenants. TBD Lab's researchers have come to view many Meta executives as interested only in improving the social media business, while the lab's ambition is to create superintelligence. Employees have disagreed over which division should get more computing power. Those working on the social media ranking algorithm have argued that more of the company's computing power should be used to improve their business rather than to train AI models.

[### ‘Greetings, earthlings': Nvidia-backed Starcloud trains first AI model in space as orbital data center race heats up (9 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/nvidia-backed-starcloud-trains-first-ai-model-in-space-orbital-data-centers.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia-backed startup Starcloud is running an artificial intelligence model in space. The Washington-based company launched a satellite with an Nvidia H100 graphics processing unit last month. It is now running Google's Gemma large language model in orbit. Starcloud's satellite is proof that space-based data centers can exist and operate a variety of AI models.

[### Neural Balance Innovations took control of my body and canceled my motion sickness (7 minute read)](https://skarredghost.com/2025/12/10/neural-balance-innovations-gvs-motion-sickness/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Neural Balance Innovations has developed a device that cancels motion sickness in the body via Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation. It sends electrical signals to the vestibular system, the part of the inner ear that manages balance, so that it syncs up with what the eyes are seeing. The Stimbox needs to be calibrated for every user, but after, it can completely remove the sensation of motion sickness when using VR devices. The device has the potential to give wearers a more realistic virtual reality as it can simulate the feeling of falling. It can be purchased now for 1,200€.

[### Forrester Study: Why 39% of AI Deployments Are Failing to Deliver ROI (Sponsor)](https://miro.com/events/secret-to-ai-success-forrester-study/?utm_campaign=tldr-second&amp;utm_source=TLDR&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=Sponsorship&amp;src=-newsletter_glb)

Most AI tools live in silos - ChatGPT for brainstorming, Claude for writing, Notion for docs. According to [new Forrester study](https://miro.com/events/secret-to-ai-success-forrester-study/?utm_campaign=tldr-second&utm_source=TLDR&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_content=Sponsorship&src=-newsletter_glb), this fragmentation is the top factor limiting returns for 39% of organizations. The study surveyed 500+ decision makers and found that the real AI opportunity isn't individual productivity, but better collaboration.

[### Should CSS be Constraints? (17 minute read)](https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/why-css-bad.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

CSS is hard, and the rules can be quite complex. It is currently hard to predict what CSS will result in. One commonly-proposed replacement for CSS is a constraint system. However, with constraint-based systems, it is possible to have more than or less than one layout that satisfies the rules. Predictability suffers again once you have complicated constraints and conflict handling rules.

[### Why AGI Will Not Happen (24 minute read)](https://timdettmers.com/2025/12/10/why-agi-will-not-happen/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The thinking around AGI and superintelligence is fundamentally flawed. A lot of the thinking is created in an echo chamber, particularly in the Bay Area, where the same ideas amplify themselves without critical awareness. This amplification of bad ideas is a big problem in shaping a beneficial future for everyone. Realistic thought should be used to shape a future that is good for everyone.

[### Silicon Valley Is Racing to Make Critical Minerals—and Blunt China's Dominance (11 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/silicon-valley-is-racing-to-make-critical-mineralsand-blunt-chinas-dominance-692390e3?st=x5gAGR&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There is a nationwide push by startups to develop sources of raw materials that the US desperately needs. Record levels of private investment and advances in artificial intelligence are resulting in new solutions to deal with China's crackdown on critical mineral exports. Any success will soften China's edge in the industry. China currently dominates the high-risk and low-margin mining and processing of many of the minerals the US depends on to build everything from smartphones to cars, jets, and satellites.
