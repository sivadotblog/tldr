[### Ocean Battery stores renewable energy at the bottom of the sea (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/energy/ocean-battery-renewable-energy-storage/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Ocean Battery is an energy storage system developed by Dutch startup Ocean Grazer. It is designed to be installed on the seafloor near offshore renewable energy generators. The system is made to function on a principle similar to that of a hydroelectric dam. Excess electricity from renewable sources can be used to pump water into a bladder, and when energy is required, the bladder can squeeze the water back through spinning turbines to generate power. A 3-minute video with animations showing how the Ocean Battery will work is available in the article.

[### World-first pig-to-human heart transplant performed in US (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/medical/world-first-pig-human-heart-transplant/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Surgeons in the US have successfully transplanted a genetically modified pig heart into a living human for the first time. The patient is alive and has not rejected the pig organ. The genetically modified heart had around 10 modifications to reduce the chances of rejection from a human immune system. Two transplants were performed last year on functionally dead patients who were kept alive for several days. The patient was too unwell to qualify for a regular heart transplant, so the experimental treatment was offered as a last resort.
