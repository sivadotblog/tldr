[### Netflix‚Äôs Big Wake-Up Call: The Power Clash Behind the Crash (9 minute read)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflixs-big-wake-up-call-the-power-clash-behind-the-crash-1235136004/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Netflix's recent earning calls revealed lower than expected subscriber growth. Some are blaming the company culture for its troubles. Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of the company, pushed for quantity of content at the expense of quality. Cindy Holland, who played a key role in launching some of the service's originals, fought to increase the quality of shows but was criticized for spending too freely. The company culture changed profoundly after Holland's departure.

[### Building electronic devices via chemical reactions (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/04/building-electronic-devices-via-chemical-reactions/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Almost all demonstrations of atomically small machines are essentially assembled by hand. A team of scientists has successfully used a chemical reaction to bind two atomically thin materials, graphene and molybdenum disulfide, potentially paving the way for mass production. The bridge molecule can be used to alter graphene's behavior in different ways. Details about the technique are available in the article.

[### Physicists Developed a Superconductor Circuit Long Thought to Be Impossible (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/a-feature-of-superconducting-circuits-thought-impossible-has-just-been-made-a-reality?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Superconductors could take supercomputing technology to a whole new level, but there are many challenges in trying to design superconducting components. A team of scientists recently discovered a technique that can direct superconducting electrons down a one-way street, which is needed for components like diodes, without external magnetic fields. There are still many problems with superconductivity to overcome before they can be used in next-generation computing. For example, the phenomenon typically only occurs in materials chilled to just above absolute zero.

[### Japanese Railroad Builds Giant Gundam-Style Robot to Fix Power Lines (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/the-byte/japanese-railroad-giant-gundam-robot?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

West Japan Rail Company is using a giant Gundam-style robot to fix remote railway power lines. The robot is piloted by a human wearing a virtual reality setup. The robot is still just a prototype and won't be put to work widely until 2024. A video of the robot doing its job is available in the article.

[### Transparent solar panels could replace windows in the future (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/transparent-solar-panels-replace-windows-in-the-future-heres-how?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Transparent solar panels have the potential to shift cities from major energy users to providers in an instant. There are several transparent solar panel technologies. Some can convert almost any glass sheet or window into a transparent solar panel. The more transparent a panel is, the less efficient it is, so scientists still need to increase the technology‚Äôs efficiency before it can be scaled up.
