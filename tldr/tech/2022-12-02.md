[### Biotech labs are using AI inspired by DALL-E to invent new drugs (7 minute read)](https://archive.ph/TTlFT?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Biotech labs are using diffusion models to create new designs for proteins never seen in nature. These models can be directed to produce designs for proteins with specific properties to do particular jobs on demand. The technology could eventually lead to the development of new and more effective drugs. While the technology seems to be able to design proteins, scientists still have to figure out how to create the proteins and test them.
