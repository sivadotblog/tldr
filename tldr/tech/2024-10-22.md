The idea of harvesting solar power continuously from space, where there are no nights, clouds, or atmosphere to interfere with the collection of photons, and beaming it back down to Earth via microwaves sounds simple, but implementing the technology is difficult. Aetherflux, a small company with only about 10 employees, plans to launch a satellite to test the idea and determine both the safety and efficiency of collecting solar energy in space. If the demo mission works, Aetherflux plans to develop a constellation of satellites to deliver power to remote locations.

TurboTax's CEO Sasan Saeedi recently got into a somewhat confrontational exchange during an interview where he was pressed about parent company Intuit's efforts to prevent a simplification of tax filing in the US. Intuit's Head of Communications requested the segment be cut from the interview or otherwise heavily edited to make it seem less confrontational. The company has been strongly opposed to the IRS making its own software for free tax filing. It offers free tax filing to some US citizens as a cover to continue a regime of charging others for tax preparation.
