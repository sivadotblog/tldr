[### ‚ÄòRemarkable‚Äô AI tool designs mRNA vaccines that are more potent and stable (5 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01487-y?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at Baidu Research in California have developed an AI tool that uses computational linguistics to optimize gene sequences in mRNA vaccines. The tool designs mRNA sequences with shapes and structures more intricate than current vaccines. This makes the mRNA vaccines more potent and stable and could result in better protection against infectious diseases. The tool has already been used to optimize at least one authorized vaccine.

[### China syncs monkey brain with a computer in a 'world first' experiment (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/china-syncs-monkey-brain-with-a-computer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese researchers claim to have conducted the world's first successful monkey brain-computer interface (BCI) experiment. BCI technology translates electrical signals from the brain into commands. The researchers used minimally invasive surgery to implant an electroencephalograph into the monkeys' cerebrovascular walls to read signals. The BCI allowed the monkeys to control robotic arms with their thoughts. It will take at least five more years for the technique to be ready for clinical use.

[### RedisRaft (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/RedisLabs/redisraft/blob/master/docs/Introduction.md?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

RedisRaft is a Redis module that allows users to create strongly-consistent clustered Redis deployments. It supports configuration changes such as adding and removing nodes. RedisRaft uses heartbeat messages to detect failed nodes. In case of failed leaders, a new one is elected. As long as the majority of its nodes remain online, a RedisRaft cluster will remain available.
