### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Satellite power grid would beam energy around the globe just like data (8 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/energy/emrod-space-solar-wireless-energy/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Emrod's technology can potentially create a global wireless power grid that can efficiently link any two points on Earth. It involves using lower-orbiting satellites to send energy where needed. The concept requires far less ground- and ocean floor-based infrastructure than other global renewable energy plans. The technology exists and it is starting to be deployed. A video explaining the concept is available at the end of the article.

[### Geothermal May Beat Batteries for Energy Storage (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/geothermal-energy?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Advanced geothermal reservoirs could store excess wind and solar power in the form of hot water or steam to be used to turn turbines for electricity when wind and solar aren't available. The systems could store energy as efficiently as lithium-ion batteries. The cost of the solution would be minimal compared to other energy storage technologies. Fervo Energy plans to build two pilot projects in Nevada to test the concept.
