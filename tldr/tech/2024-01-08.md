[### Weird things engineers believe about Web development (20 minute read)](https://birtles.blog/2024/01/06/weird-things-engineers-believe-about-development/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many web developers have ideas about browsers and the Web that can be a bit dubious. For example, they assume that web browser engineers, web developers, and the people who make Web specifications know the Web really well. Other dubious ideas include the myth that browsers aren't meant to run SPAs, that MPAs will replace SPAs, that all sites should work without JavaScript, that web development shouldn't need a build step, and that what they know is representative of web development at large. It's easy to assume what you know is representative of web development in general, but the field is much broader and deeper than most people know.

[### Why I‚Äôm excited about profit-sharing startups (8 minute read)](https://www.ryanhoover.me/post/profit-sharing-startups?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Most successful outcomes in tech often take many years to mature. The future is unpredictable and the macro environment can not be controlled. Several big shifts will drive founders and investors to pursue profit-sharing models in 2024 and beyond. Profit-sharing startups will become more popular as people look to diversify their net worth and capture liquidity sooner. This will not preclude founders from raising traditional venture capital - some businesses will still need VC to scale and win a market.
