[### Adam Neumann makes a $500 million bid for WeWork that could hit $900 million if financing and diligence firm up (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/adam-neumann-submits-bid-of-more-than-500-million-to-buy-wework.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Adam Neumann, former WeWork CEO, has submitted an unsolicited bid in excess of $500 million to acquire WeWork out of bankruptcy. The bid could potentially go up to $900 million pending due diligence. It is unclear how Neumann will finance the offer. The bid may make WeWork's bankruptcy proceedings more complex. The company is seeking to walk away from some of its longer-term commitments in less lucrative markets, but some of its lessors are fighting these efforts.

[### As AI booms, land near nuclear power plants becomes hot real estate (3 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/25/ai_boom_nuclear/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Land near power plants is set to become a hot commodity due to AI. Several data center operators, including AWS and Microsoft, have explored nuclear-powered options for their operations. While most projects are looking to build on the land surrounding nuclear plants, some projects, like Microsoft's, are exploring the idea of installing tiny modular plants to power existing data centers. While small modular reactors are not yet ready for production, there are still more than 400 reactors around the globe to collocate with.

[### The best engineering interview question I’ve ever gotten (12 minute read)](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2022/01/06/memcached-interview/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This blog post discusses a programming challenge from a software engineering interview. memcached, an in-memory key-value store, provides a built-in way to atomically add k to a number, but it doesn’t provide other arithmetic operations - there is no 'atomic multiply by k' operation. The challenge required interviewees to add a `mult` command to memcached. The challenge is well calibrated for interviews as there is only one correct answer and it is also a good representation of what most real-world programming is like.

[### Friends don't let friends export to CSV (10 minute read)](https://kaveland.no/friends-dont-let-friends-export-to-csv.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

CSV is common in the data science space as it is human-readable, less verbose than options like JSON and XML, and super-easy to produce from almost any tool. However, the format is usually underspecified and CSV files have terrible compression and performance. There are many file formats more suitable for working with tabular data. This post looks at one of them, Apache Parquet, and shows how it is better in both compression and performance with examples.
