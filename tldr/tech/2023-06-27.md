[### DeepMind claims its next chatbot will rival ChatGPT (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/26/deepmind-claims-its-next-chatbot-will-rival-chatgpt/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

DeepMind's Gemini large language model was trained using techniques from AlphaGo, the first AI system to defeat a professional human player in the board game Go. Gemini can plan, solve problems, and analyze text. It combines the strengths of AlphaGo-type systems with the capabilities of large language models. Gemini's development was spurred by the failures of Bard, Google's chatbot project. Jeff Dean, Google's most senior AI research executive, directly participated in the project.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### This drug can give us an edge in the bacteria-antibiotics arms race (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/medical/deq-bacteria-resistant-arms-race/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Bacteria can evolve genetic survival tactics much faster than humans can find new drugs to kill them. Scientists from Baylor College of Medicine discovered that a drug commonly used as a topical antiseptic significantly slows the evolution of bacteria and makes cipro, the second most prescribed antibiotic in the US, much more effective at fighting infection. Their study suggests that it may be possible to slow down pathogen evolution to the point where the body's immune system can deal with the infection without antibiotics. Global antibiotic resistance was responsible for nearly 1.3 million deaths in 2019.

[### These 'chip-scale' atomic clocks extend precise timing beyond GPS limits (5 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/chip-scale-atomic-clocks-accuracy-gps?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at NIST and Georgia Tech have developed a new type of miniature atomic clock called a chip-scale beam clock. The technology promises improved timing over weeks and months compared to existing chip-scale atomic clock systems. The device, currently still in a prototype stage, is the size of a postal stamp and initial tests show scarcely worse performance than existing chip-scale atomic clocks. The team is confident that they will be able to increase precision by a factor of 10 and stability by a factor of 100 over weekly periods.

[### A Senior Engineers Guide to FAANG Interviews (20 minute read)](https://interviewing.io/guides/hiring-process?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This guide to FAANG interviews was created by interviewers for candidates. The authors spent hundreds of hours talking to current and former FAANG interviewers about their processes. While FAANG interviews can seem daunting, they are much easier once you learn a company's operating metaphors: what they reward, what they punish, and what they're blind to. Learning a company's metaphors shows interviewers that you're part of their tribe.

[### AI is killing the old web, and the new web struggles to be born (11 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/26/23773914/ai-large-language-models-data-scraping-generation-remaking-web?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article looks at the potential effects AI will have on the future of the internet. The web used to be a place where individuals made things, but then companies took over and created platforms. Layoffs and AI-generated content are killing these platforms. AI systems can scale effortlessly and their output may potentially overrun the platforms people use for news, information, and entertainment. The decisions that we make now will determine who makes information in the future, how it is accessed, and who gets paid for it.
