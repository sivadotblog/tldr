Approximately one in eight US adults have tried the new weight-loss drugs, with more than 15 million using a prescription. At least 25,000 people in the US are starting the drug every week.

It enables the user agent to skip an element's rendering work until it is needed. It also allows for faster interactions with on-screen content.

This article contains an edited transcript of an interview with Tao where he describes a kind of AI-enabled 'industrial-scale mathematics' in which AI acts as a lubricant for mathematicians' hypotheses and approaches to unlock new information. This approach keeps humans at its core, embracing both the strengths of people and machines.
