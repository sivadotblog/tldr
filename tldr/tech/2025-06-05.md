[### AirPods to get camera control, sleep detection, new gestures, more (3 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/04/exclusive-airpods-ios-26-wwdc-features/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is working on new head gestures, sleep auto-pause, camera control, Audio Mix, and wider classroom support for AirPods. It is expected to announce these features along with major updates across all of its platforms at WWDC25. AI will play a smaller role at the conference this year. The spotlight will likely fall on design refreshes and software improvements. Details about the new AirPods features are available in the article.

[### ChatGPT introduces meeting recording and connectors for Google Drive, Box, and more (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/04/chatgpt-introduces-meeting-recording-and-connectors-for-google-drive-box-and-more/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has added new features for business users into ChatGPT.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists in Japan develop plastic that dissolves in seawater within hours (2 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/scientists-japan-develop-plastic-that-dissolves-seawater-within-hours-2025-06-04/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers in Japan have developed a plastic material that breaks down in seawater without leaving any residual trace. The material is as strong as petroleum-based plastics and can be used like regular plastic when coated. It breaks down when exposed to salt, and the components can be further processed by naturally occurring bacteria. It is non-toxic, non-flammable, and does not emit carbon dioxide. While the team has not yet detailed any plans for commercialization, their research has attracted significant interest.

[### One thing Tesla and Comma.ai overlooked in self-driving (4 minute read)](https://deepdream.substack.com/p/one-thing-tesla-and-commaai-overlooked?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Waymo was frequently mocked for being heavily geofenced. Tesla's universal 'no map' approach seemed to make more sense. However, 83% of the US population lives in urban areas - autopilot doesn't really need to be able to drive everywhere. Solving that last 20% of self-driving might be 80% of the effort. Waymo is happily chasing densely populated areas - it's now doing more than 250,000 paid rides without a driver a week.

[### Mistral releases a vibe coding client, Mistral Code (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/04/mistral-releases-a-vibe-coding-client-mistral-code/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mistral has released a vibe coding client to compete with Windsurf, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. Mistral Code is a fork of the open source project Continue. The AI-powered coding assistant bundles Mistral's models, an 'in-IDE' assistant, local deployment options, and enterprise tools into a single package. It is currently in private beta for JetBrains development platforms and Microsoft's VS Code. Mistral plans to contribute at least a portion of its improvements to Mistral Code to the Continue open source project.

[### LLMs are mirrors of operator skill (9 minute read)](https://ghuntley.com/mirrors/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Large language models (LLMs) essentially mirror the skill of their operators. AI shouldn't be banned from the interviewing process - allowing AI in the interviewing process enables you to observe how they use the technology. Companies that ban AI will either miss out on outstanding candidates or they will find their employees will start using AI in stealth. The best way to determine if someone is a skilled operator is to watch them dance with an LLM.

[### Nintendo Switch 2 draws long lines and excited gamers (3 minute read)](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/nintendo-switch-2-release-lines-excited-gamers-rcna210910?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Switch 2 was released today. The first iteration of the console was a major hit for Nintendo, selling roughly 150 million units. The Switch 2 has a bigger screen, better graphics, and larger controls. Many enthusiasts showed up early at stores to pick up their units at midnight. Nintendo had warned customers that delivery of the console was not guaranteed on launch day.

[### ‚ÄúAI will replace all the jobs!‚Äù Is Just Tech Execs Doing Marketing (14 minute read)](https://sparktoro.com/blog/ai-will-replace-all-the-jobs-is-just-tech-execs-doing-marketing/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There's no evidence that AI can, will, or has replaced a large percentage of jobs. However, there are hundreds of years of evidence showing the opposite is true: AI will almost certainly create more jobs than it displaces. The press and media cover hype stories because they draw clicks. Previous technological revolutions took jobs away from some workers, but this resulted in greater productivity, employment, and more options for workers. AI may permanently alter the employment landscape, but it is unlikely to displace a massive portion of the workforce.
