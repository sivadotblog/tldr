[### Now OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wants billions for AI chip fabs (3 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/20/altman_chip_fabs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman is reportedly seeking billions in capital to build out a network of AI chip fabs. The project would fund the construction and operation of chip factories around the world to support the growing demand for neural network accelerators. It aims to build enough assembly lines to ensure there is enough supply of AI processors to meet demand. Altman has previously expressed concerns that there aren't enough processors to go around.

[### Samsung‚Äôs smart ring might signal the start of a new wearable era (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/19/24041922/samsung-galaxy-ring-smart-ring-wearables?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Samsung ended its Unpacked event with a tease of its Galaxy Ring. There were few details given onstage besides a flashy reel of a sparkly ring with a few visible sensors on the inside of the band. A Samsung spokesperson said that the ring was designed to empower people to manage their health by providing consistent and accurate tracking data. The rings will reportedly come in three finishes and in sizes up to 13 and will be available later this year.

[### NASA Reveals Incredible X-59: A Unique, Experimental Supersonic Jet (2 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-reveals-incredible-x-59-a-unique-experimental-supersonic-jet?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NASA's X-59 is a supersonic aircraft designed to minimize the sonic boom it creates when it crosses the speed of sound. It can fly at 1.4 times the speed of sound. The project, a joint effort with Lockheed Martin, aims to revolutionize air travel by producing a new generation of commercial jets that can travel faster than the speed of sound. A picture of the research aircraft is available in the article.

[### AlphaFold found thousands of possible psychedelics. Will its predictions help drug discovery? (5 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00130-8?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have used AlphaFold, a protein-structure-prediction tool, to identify hundreds of thousands of potential new psychedelics. The predictions show that AlphaFold can be used for fast drug discovery, a process that can take years using conventional methods. While some scientists are skeptical of the potential of the technology to change the field of drug discovery, there is evidence that the tool has strong potential to help scientists find new drugs. Isomorphic Labs, DeepMind's drug-discovery spin-off, recently announced deals worth up to $2.9 billion to hunt for drugs using machine-learning tools such as AlphaFold.

[### How I‚Äôm (re)learning math as an adult (8 minute read)](https://gmays.com/how-im-relearning-math-as-an-adult/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Math Academy is a platform that focuses on helping kids learn math, with tools built-in for parents to help their kids be successful. It covers math from middle school through university graduate level and the courses are fully accredited. Adults who haven't done much math since grad school can use the platform to gain a much better understanding of stats and probability, linear algebra, and calculus. The lessons are self-paced and interactive, with most lessons around 10 minutes long, making it easy to squeeze in sessions within a busy life.

[### The Vision Pro‚Äôs first killer app is the web, whether Apple likes it or not (7 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/20/24044343/apple-vision-pro-safari-killer-app?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It's increasingly clear that the early success of the Vision Pro will depend on Safari. The open web is Apple's best chance at making its headset a winner - developers aren't exactly jumping to build new apps for Apple's new platform so far. This could be a big win for the future of the internet as developers will spend more time on web apps. Apple recently added more features to Safari and there are platform-specific features for Safari on visionOS. Apple may have to let go of some of its App Store control to help the Vision Pro get off to a good start.
