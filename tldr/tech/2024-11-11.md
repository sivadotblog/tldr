Smart-doorbell pioneer, RING, pitched on the hit show Shark Tank at a valuation of just $7 million ‚Äî the sharks shut them down.

5 years later, the company sold to Amazon for more than $1 Billion. Turning the 10% stake initially offered to the sharks from $700K into $100M!

[A similar story is brewing](https://invest.helloryse.com?tnames=loki,11-11-2024) in the Smart Shades segment of the industry, with a company called [RYSE](https://invest.helloryse.com?tnames=loki,11-11-2024) pitching on the Canadian version of Shark Tank called Dragon's Den.

The difference? [They received two offers](https://invest.helloryse.com?tnames=loki,11-11-2024) and have an addressable market that could be significantly larger than that of RING's!

[### OpenAI reportedly developing new strategies to deal with AI improvement slowdown (1 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/09/openai-reportedly-developing-new-strategies-to-deal-with-ai-improvement-slowdown/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's new model's performance exceeds its existing models, but the improvement is less than the jump from GPT-3 to GPT-4. The rate of improvement seems to be slowing down. OpenAI created a foundations team to figure out how the company can continue to improve its models. One of the proposed strategies is to train models on synthetic data produced by AI models.

[### SpaceX Pitches NASA on 'Marslink,' a Version of Starlink for the Red Planet (2 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-pitches-nasa-on-marslink-a-version-of-starlink-for-the-red-planet?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX is working on a concept version of Starlink for Mars. It has ideas about developing next-generation relay services capable of beaming 4 Mbps or more in data across 1.5 astronomical units. The Marslink concept involves placing multiple space satellites in Mars orbit to provide full visibility and interoperability for ground and orbital assets. Other companies have also submitted proposals - slides from the recent meeting of the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group showing each company's proposal are available in the article.

[### HPV vaccination: How the world can eliminate cervical cancer (10 minute read)](https://ourworldindata.org/hpv-vaccination-world-can-eliminate-cervical-cancer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cervical cancer is caused by a virus (HPV), making it preventable. The virus is also responsible for a large share of other cancers. HPV integrates itself into cells' DNA and damages key proteins that protect the cell from uncontrolled growth, eventually leading to cancer. HPV vaccines are highly effective in preventing infections - and cervical cancer. Countries like the UK and Australia are showing that the elimination of cervical cancer is possible, but much of the world is missing out.

[### Everything I've learned so far about running local LLMs (26 minute read)](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2024/11/10/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It is now possible to run a large language model (LLM) smarter than the original ChatGPT on a Raspberry PI. Running models locally allows for private, unlimited, and registration-free access. This article talks about how to run local text-based LLMs on your own hardware. It covers the software needed, the different models available, user interfaces, and more. While LLMs are fun, there are still many tasks they can't reliably do.

Screen interfaces require people to look at them, making the 'touch screen' a misnomer. Buttons, knobs, sliders, and other physical controls are making a comeback in vehicles, appliances, and personal electronics. Engineers and designers are tapping into people's sense of touch and spatial awareness to make using gadgets easier, more fun, and in some cases, safer. Physical interfaces allow people to use devices without looking and makes interactions with machines more intuitive.

[### Moving Past Skeuomorphic AI (9 minute read)](https://akilian.com/writing/nonskeumorphic-ai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI is being limited by our mental models for what to use the technology for. The current available technology can already be transformative given the right application mindset. Moving to the next level will require giving models more autonomy and self-learning capabilities. We should be building applications around things that AI is uniquely suited to do. Thinking this way will result in the creation of new services and products.
