Microsoft and OpenAI's definition of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is 'a system that can generate at least $100 billion in profits'. The companies agreed on the definition in 2023 as part of an agreement which had a clause that stated that OpenAI would stop allowing Microsoft to use any new technology it develops after AGI is achieved. OpenAI and Microsoft have been on diverging paths for some time now. Microsoft needs its own proprietary tech and OpenAI needs more money.

[### China launches 1st set of spacecraft for planned 13,000-satellite broadband constellation (3 minute read)](https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/china-launches-1st-set-of-spacecraft-for-planned-13-000-satellite-broadband-constellation-photo?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China launched 10 internet satellites on a Long March 5B rocket earlier this month. The satellites entered their predetermined orbits smoothly and the mission was a complete success. They are the first batch for Guowang, a broadband megaconstellation in low earth orbit (LEO) that will eventually consist of nearly 13,000 spacecraft. Guowang will be one of two Chinese versions of SpaceX's Starlink LEO megaconstellation.

[### Startups Begin Geoengineering the Sea (11 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ocean-carbon-removal?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Captura is a company that plans to electrochemically strip carbon dioxide out of the ocean, store or use it, then return the water to the sea, where it will naturally absorb more carbon dioxide from the air. It will start pumping as much of the Pacific ocean as it can in a few months at Hawaii's KeƒÅhole Point. Besides Captura, there are dozens of similar field trials and pilot projects that will start scaling up their facilities in 2025.

[### Why Google Bought Character AI (1 minute read)](https://manassaloi.com/2024/12/23/character-ai-goole.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google may have bought Character AI because Character AI had figured out how to run its models without costing a fortune. Character AI was able to serve millions of users without bleeding money. Google is now giving away flash models for free on AI Studio - this wouldn't be possible without figuring out how to make inference really cheap. Pre-training has hit diminishing returns, so companies are shifting toward chain-of-thought prompting and inference-time optimizations.
