[### OpenAI Reportedly Lost $540 Million Developing ChatGPT in 2022 (2 minute read)](https://www.thewrap.com/open-ai-lost-half-billion-making-chatgpt-cost/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI reported $540 million in losses last year. CEO Sam Altman plans to raise $100 billion in the next few years to develop a smarter AI capable of self-improvement. Meanwhile, OpenAI looks to acquire more data sets for its software. Some companies have banned generative AI usage with proprietary data to prevent it from entering the ChatGPT data pool. OpenAI's ambitious investment in AI technology raises the question of whether other AI companies can keep up.

[### Google announces the Pixel Fold (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23711353/google-pixel-fold-announced?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google will be launching the Pixel Fold at the Google I/O 2023 event. Leaked marketing materials and hands-on videos indicate that the Pixel Fold phone will have a full-size outer display, a Google Tensor G2 processor, and a strong hinge. The 5.8-inch phone will be able to fold open into a 7.6-inch tablet. It will cost around $1,700. Google has been encouraging Android app developers to work on foldable devices and larger screen sizes.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### The inside scoop on solar geoengineering (5 minute read)](https://archive.ph/UE5BP?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article takes a look at the world of solar geoengineering. Solar geoengineering refers to various attempts to change the Earth's climate by reflecting its sunlight. This can be done through the use of balloons, clouds, sunshades, or by releasing gasses or small particles into the atmosphere from an aircraft. There is widespread opposition to studies and debates on the topic, given the potentially irreversible impact to the planet. Despite this, a few companies have already launched independent efforts.

[### In a world first, RSV vaccines wins FDA approval for adults 60 and up (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/in-a-world-first-rsv-vaccines-wins-fda-approval-for-adults-60-and-up/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the world's first vaccine against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Arexvy from GSK will be available for adults only, aged 60 and over, pending a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In clinical trials, patients who received the vaccine had an 82.6% lower risk of developing lower-respiratory tract infections from RSV and a 94.1% drop in the chances of a severe RSV infection. Several other treatments for RSV are currently under development.

### Programming, Design & Data Science

[### Mojo may be the biggest programming language advance in decades (17 minute read)](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-05-03-mojo-launch.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI models are mostly developed in Python. Translating them into a faster implementation can be difficult and may require Python programmers to learn other languages. Mojo is a strict superset of the Python language. It provides additional functionality so that developers can write high-performance code. Mojo allows Python programmers to access the benefits of faster languages such as C.

[### Leaked Google document: ‚ÄúWe Have No Moat, And Neither Does OpenAI‚Äù (4 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/4/no-moat/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A leaked document from Google discusses how neither Google nor OpenAI has a moat. Training models from scratch is expensive and negates prior fine-tuning work. This makes the ability to train large models from scratch on expensive hardware less of a competitive advantage than previously believed. Google and OpenAI's efforts to build the most powerful language models are being surpassed by developments in the open-source LLM community.
