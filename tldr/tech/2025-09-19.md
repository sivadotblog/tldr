Agents often get 90% of the way there - only to leave YOU with the frustrating task of debugging code you didn't write.

[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/code?utm_source=publications&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=warp_code_9_19_primary&utm_content=tldr) lets developers prompt, code, and refine efficiently and accurately, from first step to last mile.

How Warp is different:

ü•á #1 coding agent: Tops Terminal-bench and SWE-bench Verified. More accurate code out of the box.

‚ôªÔ∏è Tight feedback loop: Built-in code review and lightweight editing let you quickly spot issues, hand-edit, or reprompt.

‚ö°Ô∏è Proven efficiency: Early users generate 150M+ lines weekly with a 97% acceptance rate ‚Äî [saving 1‚Äì2 hours daily](https://www.warp.dev/code?utm_source=publications&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=warp_code_9_19_primary&utm_content=tldr).

### Big Tech & Startups

[### Since Leaving Washington, Elon Musk Has Been All In on His AI Company (12 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/technology/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-xai.html?unlocked_article_code=1.nE8.imfY.Ndayg7KBKaRL&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk laid out his vision for xAI in a rare companywide meeting on Wednesday. He told employees that he wants to build systems that are 'maximally truth seeking', as forcing AI to lie or believe things that aren't true creates risks of a dystopian future. He says that xAI can build technology that will eventually help his other businesses. Musk spent most of the summer at xAI's offices, raising questions about how much time he is spending at his other companies.

[### Google adds Gemini to Chrome for all users in push to bolster AI search (4 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/google-gemini-chrome-ai-search.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google is rolling out Gemini in Chrome on desktop and mobile. The integration will allow users to ask Gemini for help understanding the contents of a particular webpage. It works across tabs and can perform tasks like scheduling meetings or searching YouTube for videos. Gemini in Chrome will integrate deeply with Google apps like Calendar, YouTube, and Maps.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### China's Brain Implant Startups Take On Musk's Neuralink in New Tech Race (9 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-18/china-s-brain-startups-take-on-musk-s-neuralink-in-new-tech-race?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1ODI1MzcyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzU4ODU4NTI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMlQzV1RHUEwzWUkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.e5xYjxzf9v0jD4_9QgeDbcdspkC_ZmF5UU23QrBBkt4&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China has pledged support across research, clinical trials, and commercialization to create a world-class brain-tech cluster. The policy momentum may ease regulatory bottlenecks that create an explosive phase of growth. While the US still holds the lead when it comes to full system-level development, China is catching up quickly - and leading in some areas. China envisions brain interfaces embedded into everyday items such as headphones and glasses, hinting at how the function may become a core tenet of future technology.

[### To save its unique and rare birds, New Zealand is turning to AI and genetic research (12 minute read)](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5508455/ai-technology-birds-new-zealand-conservation-predators-endangered-species?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

New Zealand plans to eliminate invasive predators by 2050 to give its native birds a chance. This will be the largest invasive species removal project in the world, with millions of animals in line for extermination. The country is using new technology, like automated traps that use artificial intelligence, and is researching ways to potentially stop invasive predators from breeding. The technologies and techniques developed in the program could help other countries deal with their invasive species.

[### OM1 (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/OpenMind/OM1/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OM1 is a hardware-agnostic, open source, modular agentic OS for robots. It enables developers to prototype, test, and deploy robotics applications without being tied to a specific platform. OM1 agents can process diverse inputs, like web data, social media, camera feeds, and LIDAR, and perform physical actions, including motion, autonomous navigation, and natural conversations. The OM1 project aims to make it easy to create highly capable human-focused robots that are easy to upgrade and reconfigure to accommodate different physical form factors.

[### How Well Do New Python Type Checkers Conform? A Deep Dive into Ty, Pyrefly, and Zuban (10 minute read)](https://sinon.github.io/future-python-type-checkers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Three new Python type-checking tools have emerged this year, each backed by significant pedigree and resources. While the tools are all built in Rust, they all have different goals and philosophies. The continued shift towards Rust-based implementations promises faster type checking, better IDE integration, and an improved developer experience for large codebases. This post looks at how well the new Python type checkers conform to provide insight into specification compliance. While conformance test coverage is important for specification compliance and handling edge cases, it is not always the best predictor of a type checker's utility for everyday Python development.

[### The Humanoid Thesis (15 minute read)](https://x.com/rewkang/status/1968392366987121081?s=12&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The scale of opportunity in humanoid robots is unlike anything seen before. Conservative estimates suggest that there could be 100 million to 1 billion humanoid robots deployed globally over the coming decades, translating to $5 trillion to $50 trillion in potential market value. Dropping the costs of labor can increase profits for businesses several times over. General-purpose robots will eventually be as ubiquitous as cars, computers, or phones.

[### AI Is Learning to Predict the Future‚ÄîAnd Beating Humans at It (4 minute read)](https://time.com/7318577/ai-model-forecasting-predict-future-metaculus/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Metaculus is a forecasting platform that poses questions of geopolitical importance to amateur participants. Every three months, it holds a competition for predicting the future with a prize pot of about $5,000. One of the top 10 finishers in the Summer Cup was an AI developed by UK-based startup, Mantic.
