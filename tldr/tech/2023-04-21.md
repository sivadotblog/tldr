[### Study links 'stuck' stem cells to hair turning gray (3 minute read)](https://phys.org/news/2023-04-links-stuck-stem-cells-hair.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A study by researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine found that certain stem cells in the skin of mice have a unique ability to move between different growth compartments in hair follicles. These cells control hair color by making protein pigments. The study showed that as mice age, these cells increasingly become stuck in the hair follicle stem cell compartment and lose their ability to mature into pigment cells, resulting in a loss of hair color. The same cells are also found in humans.

Ebb Carbon, a startup founded by former Tesla, SolarCity, and Google X employees, has found a way to remove carbon from the atmosphere while making the ocean less acidic. The process involves removing acidity from water and making it slightly alkaline, which triggers a chemical reaction that absorbs carbon dioxide and converts it into bicarbonate. Ebb Carbon's system is designed to be manufactured for scalability. A redacted version of Ebb Carbon's 13-slide pitch deck is available in the article.

[### When Apple Comes Calling, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs the Kiss of Death‚Äô (13 minute read)](https://archive.ph/oypLr?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's long-term plan, when it takes an interest in a company, is to eventually create its own version of the company's product and take it all. It usually starts with Apple approaching a company with discussions about potential partnerships or integration of their technology with Apple products. The talks then end and Apple launches its own similar features. Apple claims that it doesn't steal technology and that it respects the intellectual property of other companies. Apple has attempted to invalidate more patent claims before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board than any other petitioner since 2012.
