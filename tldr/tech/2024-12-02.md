It took 483 attempts, with the message fee rising to $450, to finally convince Freysa to release its funds. This post contains an analysis of the winning prompt.

React is a legacy technology, but it continues to appear in greenfield applications. It is not built to meet current needs or performance standards. This article discusses why developers should stop using React and presents alternative frameworks that work better. Developers building SPAs or islands of client-side interactivity are now spoiled for choice with dozens of contemporary frameworks worthy of their attention, like Svelte, Lit, FAST, Solid, Qwik, Marko, HTMX, Vue, and Stencil.

Libra was an advanced, high-performance, payments-centric blockchain paired with a stablecoin developed by Meta. The project was announced in June 2019 but eventually killed off due to politics.

[### The Most Hated Way of Firing Someone Is More Popular Than Ever. It's the Age of the PIP (14 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/firing-someone-performance-improvement-plans-more-popular-the-pip-7cac7062?st=7tqjn5&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The use of performance improvement plans (PIPs) is on the rise. PIPs usually list tough-to-achieve goals to be completed within 30 to 90 days. Failure to complete the tasks results in termination of employment. They are intended to bring consistency and fairness to the way employees are judged and managed, but both workers and managers dread them. This post presents a guide to PIPs and how to navigate them, as well as alternatives to the practice. One common tactic for employees placed on PIPs is to file for a leave of absence, which stops the clock on the PIP, allowing the employee to job hunt without having to explain a resume gap to prospective new employers.
