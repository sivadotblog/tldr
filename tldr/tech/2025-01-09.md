[### iOS 18.3 hints at new ‚ÄòInvites' app from Apple to create and manage events (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/08/ios-18-3-invites-app-events/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

References to an 'Apple Invites' app were first found in one of the iOS 18.2 betas. They were removed from the final version, but they are now back in iOS 18.3 beta 2. The app is likely designed to help users organize meetings and in-person events. It will essentially show a list of people invited to an event and who has already confirmed attendance. It is unclear whether Invites will be a standalone app or if Apple will integrate it with other parts of its system.

[### Nvidia may enter the Arm CPU market after all (3 minute read)](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-hints-arm-cpu-plans/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has hinted at broader ambitions for the Arm-based CPU within the GB10 Grace Blackwell chip. MediaTek, the chip's co-developer, also has its own aspirations. Huang recently introduced Nvidia's Project Digits at CES 2025. The cutting-edge $3,000 desktop AI supercomputer delivers an impressive 1 petaFLOPS of FP4 floating-point performance, making it a powerful tool for running AI models and workloads for home enthusiasts and researchers.

[### NASA has just two Mars Sample Return mission lander options left (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/08/nasa_whittles_down_mars_sample/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NASA will need until 2026 before making a final decision on how the Mars Sample Return mission will work. The space agency has whittled the options to two: use the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which would employ the sky crane technology to deposit a lander on the surface of the red planet, or use a commercial vendor to get a lander to Mars. The plan relies on the Perseverance trundlebot being able to make it to the lander. The JPL option would cost between $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion, while the commercial providers may cost between $5.8 billion and $7.1 billion. NASA has not provided details on what the commercial vendors suggested due to proprietary information concerns.

[### Chinese RISC-V project teases 2025 debut of freely licensed advanced chip design (3 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/08/chinese_riscv_project_teases_2025/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Institute of Computing Technology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Xiangshan project aims to use the permissively licensed RISC-V ISA to create a high-performance chip. It has published the designs of its third-generation chip called Kunminghu, a 64-bit RISC-V architecture that supports multiple parallel processing units capable of integer, floating-point, and vector operations. The designs will be available under a royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, use, modify, or distribute.

Stagehand is a tool for building browser automations. It offers three simple AI APIs to provide the building blocks for web automation via natural language. Stagehand is fully compatible with Playwright - it makes Playwright more accessible to non-technical users and less vulnerable to minor changes in the UI/DOM. Anything that can be done in a browser can be done with Stagehand.

[### Double-keyed Caching: How Browser Cache Partitioning Changed the Web (12 minute read)](https://addyosmani.com/blog/double-keyed-caching/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The web's caching model recently underwent a fundamental shift that challenges many performance optimization assumptions. Browsers traditionally maintained a simple key-value store for cached resources. While efficient, this model leaked information. With the new model, double-keyed caching, browsers use two pieces of information: the top-level site making the request and the resource's URL. It caches identical resources separately for each site that requests them, effectively partitioning the cache and preventing cross-site tracking and other privacy issues - a trade-off between security and efficiency.

StackOverflow received 87,105 new questions in March 2023. This number was reduced to 58,792 by March 2024, and by December it was 25,566. The site is becoming more outdated and questions are being closed more than ever before. StackOverflow was already in decline before ChatGPT's launch. It was just so big that it took years to topple to the ground.
