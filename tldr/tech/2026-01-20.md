[### I was a top 0.01% Cursor user. Here's why I switched to Claude Code 2.0 (32 minute read)](https://blog.silennai.com/claude-code?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Claude Code 2.0 has a flexible and robust harness with an evolved UX and fewer bugs. The RLHF Anthropic did on Opus 4.5 completely changed the equation. Users no longer need to review code or instruct the model at the level of files or functions: they can just test behaviors instead. Claude Code can be used by developers who never plan on learning how to code and just care about outputs.

[### LLMs and your career (3 minute read)](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2026-01-19-llms-and-your-career.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Interesting software development jobs aren't likely to disappear. The jobs that are dependent on the fundamentals of software aren't going to stop being dependent on the fundamentals of software. More LLM usage will mean more stress on the tools and applications that rely on the fundamentals of software. The most conservative way to build a career as a software developer is to be practical and effective at problem-solving and to better understand over time how the tools you use work so that you can make better decisions.

[### All Bets Are On: The Rise of Prediction Markets (10 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/technology/polymarket-kalshi-prediction-markets.html?unlocked_article_code=1.F1A.vLMt.kZZgm_jW911G&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nearly $12 billion was traded on Kalshi and Polymarket in December, up more than 400% from a year earlier. The rise of prediction markets has created new risks and raised fears about the spread of gambling. There are also concerns about market manipulation and insider trading. Proponents of prediction markets claim that the platforms are fundamentally different from gambling and that they offer a valuable new source of information by allowing people to bet on world events.
