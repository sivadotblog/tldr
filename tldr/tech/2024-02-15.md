[### Why walking around in public with Vision Pro makes no sense (7 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/why-walking-around-in-public-with-vision-pro-makes-no-sense/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The passthrough on Apple's Vision Pro gives users all the fidelity and depth perception they need to comfortably see what they're doing and navigate safely on foot. Its limited field of view and poor low-light visibility could pose issues when driving. While critics of the device say it takes people's attention away from reality, the Vision Pro may actually make users more aware of their surroundings as their eyes are always up and taking in the world (when in passthrough mode). This article details a first-hand experience of what it feels like to use the device in public.

[### Open-Source Security Chip Released (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-titan-chip?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The OpenTitan coalition has announced the first commercial silicon chip that includes built-in open-source hardware security. The chip, called Earl Grey, features a number of built-in hardware security and cryptography modules in a self-contained microprocessor. It uses a security protocol called Root of Trust, which provides an on-chip source of cryptographic keys that is inaccessible remotely. As part of the project, OpenTitan developed a framework for open-source hardware design that provides rules for documentation, pre-defined interfaces and quality standards, and a governance structure that lays out how different partners make decisions as a collective.

[### The text file that runs the internet (16 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

robots.txt has kept the internet from chaos for three decades. The simple text file represents a deal between some of the earliest pioneers of the internet to respect each other's wishes and build the internet in a way that benefits everybody. It allows anyone who runs a website to tell the web who's allowed on the site and who isn't. The system used to work, but AI is now threatening to change everything. This article takes a look at the history behind robots.txt, how it works, different types of web crawlers, the tradeoff between sites and the search engineers crawling them, and how AI changes the balance of the internet.
