OpenAI unveiled four major API updates for developers on Monday at its DevDay 2024 event in San Francisco. The most notable new API feature is the Realtime API, which enables developers to build features similar to ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode into their applications. It streamlines the process of creating voice assistants so developers can handle speech recognition, text processing, and text-to-speech conversion with a single API call. The other API updates enable developers to fine-tune smaller and cheaper models from more advanced models, speed up inference by remembering frequently used prompts, and fine-tune models using images.
