[### Oddly heavy particle may have just broken the reigning model of particle physics (5 minute read)](https://www.livescience.com/heavy-w-boson-measurement-cracking-standard-model?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at the Fermilab in Illinois have measured the mass of a subatomic particle called the W boson. The ultraprecise measurement found that the particle had a mass seven standard deviations higher than the Standard Model predicts. The Standard Model is a framework that governs the world of quantum physics. There is an incredibly small probability that the result occurred by chance. Another experiment will be conducted to confirm the measurement. If the result can be replicated, it could mean a revision or extension of the Standard Model.

[### A new heat engine with no moving parts is as efficient as a steam turbine (3 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2022/thermal-heat-engine-0413)

Engineers at MIT and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have designed a heat engine with no moving parts. The engine can convert heat to electricity with over 40% efficiency. The researchers plan to create a system that stores excess renewable energy into heavily insulated banks of hot graphite that will use the new engine to convert the heat to energy when needed. The battery can operate at high temperatures with low maintenance costs as it has no moving parts. It could enable a fully decarbonized power grid.
