[### The Race between Waymo, Cybercab, and Uber (13 minute read)](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/the-race-between-waymo-cybercab-and?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

One of the big transformations of this year will be robotaxis. Waymo will likely partner with Uber in many locations because Uber owns demand, but over time, Waymo will want to go direct. Cybercab will appear sometime this year and undercut both Uber and Waymo in price. Uber's demand for rides will go down pretty quickly once price drops - Waymo is currently more expensive than Uber, but it is still thriving because people prefer to ride without a driver.

[### OpenAI bets big on audio as Silicon Valley declares war on screens (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/openai-bets-big-on-audio-as-silicon-valley-declares-war-on-screens/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has unified several engineering, product, and research teams over the past couple of months to overhaul its audio models. The company is reportedly preparing to launch an audio-first personal device in about a year. Its new audio model will sound more natural, be able to handle interruptions, and even speak when users are talking. The entire tech industry seems to be headed toward a future where screens become background noise and audio takes center stage.

[### Starlink is beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation focused on increasing space safety (1 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/2006790372681220530.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX is lowering all Starlink satellites from around 550 km to around 480 km over the course of the year. The shell lowering will be tightly coordinated with other operators, regulators, and USSPACECOM. Condensing Starlink orbits will increase space safety, particularly with difficult-to-control risks like uncoordinated maneuvers and launches by other satellite operators.

Mark Thomson is now the director general of CERN. One of the first things he will do during his term is to turn off the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to make way for a major upgrade that will make the LHC more precise with its measurements of particles and their interactions. The upgrade will dominate Thomson's five-year tenure. The LHC will reach its end of life around 2041.

[### Build Software. Build Users (4 minute read)](https://dima.day/blog/build-software-build-users/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Writing a lot of tests doesn't always guarantee software quality. Engineers need to study target users more deeply to really understand how they will use their products. One way to do this is by creating AI users to test software. This can result in a feedback loop that allows engineers to iterate quickly.

[### 2026: The Great Engineering Divergence (5 minute read)](https://x.com/pauldix/status/2006423514446749965?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Once coding speed jumps, everything around it becomes a constraint. Developers' throughput is now capped by clarifying requirements, reviewing changes, validating correctness and performance, getting to production safely, and operating the product. The great engineering divergence will be determined by who raises that ceiling end-to-end. Organizations that update their processes to improve the non-code chokepoints will reap the largest rewards this year.

[### 2025 letter (80 minute read)](https://danwang.co/2025-letter/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Silicon Valley and the Communist Party are similar in that both are serious, self-serious, and completely humorless. They both tend to speak in either a bland corporate tone or a philosophical register. These two forces both aim to increase their centrality while weakening the agency of whole nation-states. This article looks at how the two parties differ in their AI efforts and what that might mean for the future of humanity.
