[### OpenAI‚Äôs Moonshot: Solving the AI Alignment Problem (12 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-alignment-problem-openai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is dedicating 20% of its computing power to solve the AI alignment problem by 2027. The AI alignment problem is the idea that AI systems might not have goals that align with those of humans. This may become a significant issue in the future if superintelligent AI systems are developed. This article features an interview with Jan Leike, OpenAI's head of alignment research, where they talk about solving the AI alignment problem and OpenAI's subgoal of building an aligned AI research tool to help solve the alignment problem.

[### Rare oxygen isotope detected at last ‚Äî and it defies expectations (8 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02713-3?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Oxygen-28 has been detected for the first time. While the isotope was predicted to be stable, it disintegrated rapidly after creation. Oxygen-28 is an isotope of oxygen with 12 extra neutrons in its nucleus. The new findings mean that physicists might have to update theories of how atomic nuclei are structured.

[### Scale automated QA without overspending (Sponsor)](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=ScaleAutomatedQA09012023&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter)

Most QA teams are too resource-constrained to maintain an automated end-to-end test suite for their entire product. But costs to scale QA are hard to justify. The end result? Gaps in test coverage and bugs shipped to production. Here's a cost-effective solution.

[QA Wolf](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=ScaleAutomatedQA09012023&utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter) is a new technology-enabled service that gets you to [80% automated test coverage in just 4 months](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=ScaleAutomatedQA09012023&utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter). Plus, they include 24-hour maintenance, a [zero flake guarantee](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=ScaleAutomatedQA09012023&utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter), and unlimited parallel runs on their Kubernetes infrastructure.

[### Everything I wish I knew before moving 50,000 lines of code to React Server Components (20 minute read)](https://www.mux.com/blog/what-are-react-server-components?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

React Server Components (RSCs) are React components that run on the server instead of the client. Frameworks that support RSCs allow developers to define where code runs. Server components are able to fetch data from directly within the component and stream that data to the client, making fetching data fast and simple. This article discusses how Mux moved over to using RSCs and covers why Server Components matter, what they're good and bad at, how to use them, how to incrementally adopt them, and the kind of advanced patterns to use to keep RSCs under control.
