[### OpenAI board considers special voting powers to prevent Elon Musk takeover (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/openai-board-considers-special-voting-powers-to-prevent-elon-musk-takeover/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is considering granting new voting rights to its nonprofit board to help it fight the unsolicited takeover bid from Elon Musk. Giving the nonprofit's board outsized voting power would ensure it retains control of the restructured company and is able to overrule other investors, ensuring OpenAI can fight off hostile bids from outsiders. OpenAI could also consider a plan that would let shareholders buy up additional shares at a discount to fend off hostile takeovers.

[### Thinking Machines Lab is ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati's new startup (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/thinking-machines-lab-is-ex-openai-cto-mira-muratis-new-startup/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's former CTO Mira Murati's new startup, Thinking Machines Lab, has come out of stealth. The startup intends to build tooling to make AI work for peoples' unique needs and goals and to create AI systems that are more widely understood, customizable, and generality capable than those currently available. It will focus on building multimodal systems that can adapt to the full spectrum of human expertise and enable broader applications. Murati joins a growing list of former OpenAI execs who have launched startups.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists Created the Lightest and Strongest Nanomaterial Ever (3 minute read)](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a63786292/ai-nanomaterial/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at the University of Toronto have created a new material with the toughness of steel that weighs about as much as foam. They used AI to recognize the best configurations of nanostructures to create the tough and impossibly light material. The new nanomaterial can be mass-produced, unlike its predecessors. The lightweight nature of the material could result in more comfortable prosthetics and implants and more efficient vehicles.

[### AI used to design a multi-step enzyme that can digest some plastics (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/using-ai-to-design-proteins-is-now-easy-making-enzymes-remains-hard/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI-driven protein design has enabled the possibility of creating things unlike anything found in nature. Scientists have successfully created an enzyme with the potential to digest plastics. Breaking down ester bonds in plastics requires four steps - getting AI to design a protein with the right configuration to do one of these steps is easy, but having it cycle through all four is much harder. The scientists overcame challenges by adding more AI models and eventually designed an esterase capable of digesting the bonds in PET, a common plastic.

[### Kafka at the low end: how bad can it get? (3 minute read)](https://broot.ca/kafka-at-the-low-end.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Kafka does poorly as a job queue. It unfairly assigns jobs to workers, even if other workers have nothing to do. Kafka is not a bad tool, it is just not designed for low volume - it was designed for scenarios where a conventional single-node message broker can't keep up. If that speed isn't required, then it's better to use a conventional broker with more suitable features (at least until Queues for Kafka comes along).

[### My LLM codegen workflow atm (15 minute read)](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article discusses a workflow that uses large language models for code generation (LLM codegen) that has been effective for building many small products. The workflow involves brainstorming a spec, making a plan, and then executing that plan using LLM codegen. The process is repeated until magic happens.
