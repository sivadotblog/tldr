[### OpenAI announces SearchGPT, its AI-powered search engine (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205701/openai-searchgpt-ai-search-engine-google-perplexity-rival?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has announced a prototype of an AI-powered search engine with real-time access to information across the internet. SearchGPT can summarize findings and answer questions about queries. It will only be accessible to 10,000 test users at launch. OpenAI is working with third-party partners and using direct content feeds to build its search results.

[### Google claims math breakthrough with proof-solving AI models (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/google-ai-earns-silver-medal-equivalent-at-international-mathematical-olympiad/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google DeepMind's AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 AI systems reportedly solved four out of the six problems from this year's International Mathematical Olympiad. AlphaProof uses reinforcement learning to train itself while AlphaGeometry 2 is powered by a Gemini-based language model. While the achievement is significant, the programs needed a lot more time to solve the problems than human contestants, and some of the problems needed to be manually translated by humans before the AI could understand them.

[### The US nuclear industry is stuck. Can this startup get it rolling again? (6 minute read)](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/the-us-nuclear-industry-is-stuck-can-this-startup-get-it-rolling-again?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Nuclear Company came out of stealth last week by announcing its aim to deploy a 6-gigawatt nuclear fission reactor fleet by the mid-2030s. 6 gigawatts is more nuclear-generating capacity than the US has deployed in the last decade. The company plans to use proven licensed technology to construct a series of reactors across the US. Its founders believe that the slow deployment of nuclear power in the US is partly due to the industry's own making as it focuses too much on first-of-a-kind constructions rather than on a repeatable, fleet-scale approach.

[### A twice-yearly injection offers 100% protection against HIV, study suggests (4 minute read)](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hiv-injection-twice-yearly-offers-protection-rcna163406?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Results from a recent study on Sunlenca, an HIV preventive injection, found it provided 100% protection against the disease. There were no infections among the 5,000 female study participants who received the shots. The shots still need to be tested in men before the drugmaker Gilead will seek permission to use it as a protection against infection. Sunlenca is already approved as a treatment for HIV in the US, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere. Gilead will pursue a voluntary licensing program that will allow a select number of generic producers to make the drug.

Elon Musk and Tesla's board are currently being sued for breach of fiduciary duty due to xAI. Musk started xAI despite claiming that Tesla is an AI company. The lawsuit cites a talent acquisition issue, Musk's threat to not build AI products at Tesla if he doesn't get 25% control over the company, and the fact that Musk diverted H100 processors meant for Tesla to xAI. It is asking for Musk to transfer his shares of xAI to Tesla along with other damages. Musk is currently trying to get Tesla's board to approve a $5 billion investment into xAI.
