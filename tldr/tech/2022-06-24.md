[### Drug cocktail makes stem cells that could grow organisms from scratch (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/biology/drug-cocktail-totipotent-stem-cells-revert/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from China have developed a new drug cocktail that can convert cells into totipotent stem cells. Totipotent stem cells are able to become any cell in the body as well as supportive tissues. The drug cocktail contains a mix of three molecules: TTNPB, 1-Azakenpaullone, and WS6. This breakthrough could lead to the creation of living organisms straight from mature cells without the need for sperm and eggs.
