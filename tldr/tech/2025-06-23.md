Free trials are meant to drive adoption, not rack up costs. But for modern SaaS apps, trial abuse is a growing threat: fake signups, disposable emails, and automated account farming drain compute and distort metrics.

[WorkOS Radar](https://workos.com/radar?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q22025) helps stop abuse before it spreads. With [built-in protection](https://workos.com/blog/how-workos-radars-bot-detection-works?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q22025) against bots, brute force attacks, and even impossible travel logins, and free trial abuse itself, your app gets the real-time defense it needs.

[### Meta, EssilorLuxottica unveil Oakley smart glasses (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/20/meta-essilorluxottica-oakley-smart-glasses-hstn.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta and EssilorLuxottica revealed the Oakley Meta HSTN on Friday. The HSTN smart glasses feature Meta's artificial intelligence assistant and have a starting price of $399. They contain Oakley's PRIZM Lens technology, which helps athletes see better across changing light and weather conditions. The glasses will come in various frame-and-lens color combinations - a limited edition with gold lenses and accents will be available for $499. The limited-edition version will be available to preorder on July 11 and the standard Oakley Meta HSTN will go on sale later this summer.

[### Tesla Begins Limited Robotaxi Service in Austin (7 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/business/tesla-robotaxi-service-austin.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Q08.KdDI.w-g9FEWttVOg&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla began limited operations of its self-driving taxi service yesterday in Austin, Texas. The service is only available to 'Early Access' riders and the vehicles are confined to certain streets. Tesla employees will be riding in the front passenger seats and the vehicles may not operate in bad weather. Tesla's stock market valuation rests largely on promises that the company will be able to use artificial intelligence to allow its vehicles to drive autonomously pretty much anywhere there are roads - the Austin project will provide the first indications of whether Tesla's technology can match its ambitions.

[### Psyche keeps its date with an asteroid, but now it's running in backup mode (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/psyche-keeps-its-date-with-an-asteroid-but-now-its-running-in-backup-mode/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The NASA Psyche spacecraft launched in October 2023 and proceeded normally until April 1 this year, when it detected a drop in pressure inside the line that feeds xenon fuel to its four thrusters. The craft reacted to the pressure signature by powering off the thrusters - this will have no effect on the mission's scheduled arrival at asteroid Psyche in August 2029. The spacecraft recently switched to its backup fuel line and resumed full thruster operations. The next waypoint on Psyche's voyage will be a flyby of Mars in May 2026.

[### MIT student prints AI polymer masks to restore paintings in hours (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/mit-student-prints-ai-polymer-masks-to-restore-paintings-in-hours/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

MIT graduate student Alex Kachkine developed a technique that uses AI-generated polymer films to physically restore damaged paintings in hours. It works by printing a transparent 'mask' containing thousands of precisely color-matched regions that conservators apply directly to an original artwork. These masks can be removed whenever needed, so it's a reversible process. Using the technique creates a digital record of what mask was used, so future conservators will have an extremely clear understanding of what was done to every artwork.

[### How to Vibe Code as a Senior Engineer (7 minute read)](https://blog.alexmaccaw.com/how-to-vibe-code-as-a-senior-engineer/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Vibe coding is a new way of building software where you let the AI models do most of the work. Users write prompts, sketch out a plan, and let the model take over. This allows users to build features in hours, but it requires some experience to wield. This article provides some tips on how to vibe code for people who know what they're doing. It covers how to write a good prompt, what AI is good and bad at, the required tools for vibe coding, and more.

Serious engineering teams that want to build thoughtful, well-crafted products need to learn to use AI as it can result in building better products. Building with AI is fast - the velocity gains are important as they allow teams to tighten feedback loops with users faster. Using AI to write software requires a huge shift that challenges some of the ideas previously considered common wisdom. This post looks at how teams should approach working with AI tools.

Startups trying to reach unicorn status used to aim to hire rapidly, but these days, the bragging rights are going to entrepreneurs who can keep their headcount the lowest. Fast and lean growth has been made possible by AI assistants, advisers, coders, and marketers. Companies with just a handful of employees are now claiming tens or even hundreds of millions in annual revenue through botscaling.

Apple is considering potentially bidding for artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI to address the need for more AI talent and technology. The internal discussions are at an early stage and may not lead to an offer. Acquiring Perplexity would help Apple develop an AI-based search engine, which could help it cope with the potential loss of its longstanding arrangement with Google. Meta tried to buy Perplexity earlier this year, but the companies failed to reach an agreement.
