[### Gene therapy restores hearing in toddlers and teenagers born with congenital deafness ‚Äì new research (7 minute read)](https://theconversation.com/gene-therapy-restores-hearing-in-toddlers-and-teenagers-born-with-congenital-deafness-new-research-258112?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have developed a form of gene therapy that can successfully restore hearing in toddlers and young adults born with OTOF-related deafness, a condition caused by mutations in the OTOF gene. People with this condition have healthy hearing structures in their inner ear, but one crucial gene isn't working properly - fixing the faulty gene restores hearing. The researchers used a virus as a delivery system to carry a working copy of the OTOF gene directly to the inner ear's hearing cells, restoring hearing sometimes to near-normal levels.

Continuous AI is the concept of integrating AI tooling automatically into existing development flows. This doesn't include tooling that purports to write and test entire changes for developers. Continuous AI can add a surprising amount of value. This article discusses some ways in which to integrate AI to perform automated checks, organizational tasks, and help with other parts of the software engineering process.

[### Ruby on Rails: The Open-Source Blueprint (7 minute read)](https://blog.codeminer42.com/ruby-on-rails-the-open-source-blueprint/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Ruby on Rails has embraced open source principles since its debut in 2004, giving developers freedom, flexibility, and a strong community-driven direction. Rails thrived because anyone could contribute, companies invested in it while keeping it free, and its modular design allowed endless customization. The project proved that open source software can compete with and often surpass commercial alternatives.
