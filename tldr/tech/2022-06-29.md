[### Pyramid lenses catch light from any angle to boost solar cell efficiency (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/energy/agile-pyramid-lenses-boost-solar-cell-efficiency/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Engineers from Stanford have developed a pyramid-shaped lens that can focus sunlight from any angle onto a solar cell. The Axially Graded Index Lenses (AGILE) can capture more than 90% of the light that hits its surface, focusing it to be three times brighter. Each layer of the lens bends light to a different degree, allowing light to enter from any angle while still remaining focused. The technology could allow solar energy to be used in more places. Pictures of AGILE prototypes are available in the article.

[### A company aims to power the world for millions of years by digging the deepest holes ever (4 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/company-power-world-dig-deepest-holes?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Quaise Energy is an MIT spinout that wants to use X-rays to melt rock to create the world's deepest holes and capture geothermal energy. It plans to use a microwave-emitting device called a gyrotron to vaporize rock, removing the need for complicated downhole equipment. Quaise aims to extract energy from pilot geothermal wells by 2026. The company intends to capture energy on a scale large enough to meet human energy needs for millions of years.

[### Virtual Modules for Fun and Profit (6 minute read)](https://hire.jonasgalvez.com.br/2022/jun/10/virtual-modules-for-fun-and-profit/?hmsr=joyk.com&amp;utm_source=joyk.com&amp;utm_medium=referral?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Virtual modules are an amazing but underrated feature for JavaScript. Using virtual modules provides internal functionality without the boilerplate weight and without compromising extensibility. This article talks about how virtual modules were used in the development of Fastify DX. Frameworks typically bundle their internals as external npm packages, but Fastify DX packs most of its internals as virtual modules.

Researchers from Johns Hopkins University have developed a new technique that allowed a partially paralyzed man to feed himself using robotic arms connected to a brain-machine interface. The method uses a shared control system that minimizes the amount of mental input required to complete a task. The technology is still young. The scientists plan to add touch-like sensory feedback and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the system while reducing the need for visual confirmation.

[### Modern city dwellers have lost about half their gut microbes (4 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/article/modern-city-dwellers-have-lost-about-half-their-gut-microbes?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists comparing the genomes of intestinal bacteria in primate and human populations have found that humans have lost many microbes that have been present in our guts since before humans became human. Certain gut microbes are found in almost all primates, suggesting that they share a common ancestor. Gut bacteria can influence mood and how the immune system responds to pathogens and allergens, making the researchers concerned about how these absent gut microbes could affect human health. It may be possible to restore them with probiotics.
