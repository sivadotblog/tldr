[### Tesla in discussion to license Full Self-Driving software to another automaker (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/23800972/tesla-fsd-license-car-company-driver-assist?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla is in early discussions to license its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology to another major automaker that has not been named. Elon Musk says that licensing the software has always been part of the plan. Tesla's FSD works on local roads with traffic signals, intersections, and vulnerable road users. It requires drivers to pay attention to the road and take control of the vehicle when asked. There are currently 16 crashes by Tesla vehicles using Autopilot being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, out of which only one caused a fatality.

Apple is readying its own large language model, Ajax. It is recruiting more engineers to work on generative AI. Ajax is solely for internal use at Apple. Apple staff are using it for real work like prototyping products and summarizing text. The company does not currently intend to launch the chatbot, but it is trying to find a consumer angle for it. Apple has already deeply embedded AI and machine learning technology into everything it's doing.

Botanists have been storing plant specimens from extinct species for centuries. They are now starting to realize their potential to resurrect life forms long believed lost forever. Libraries of data from herbarium specimens of extinct plants are now available in browsable digital databases. Attempts to revive extinct animals will only result in hybrid genetically-engineered animals, but successful recovery of a plant will result in the resurrection of the actual species.

Getting hearing aids could cut the risk of cognitive decline in half. Cognitive decline and dementia have become a growing problem as people are living longer. Hearing loss is one of the biggest risk factors for developing dementia. There are several reasons why hearing loss might contribute to cognitive decline, such as the brain having to work harder to decode audio signals, brain atrophy, or a lack of social activity.

[### Why Did Meta Open-Source Llama 2? (2 minute read)](https://matt-rickard.com/why-did-meta-open-source-llama?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article presents an in-depth analysis on why Meta made Llama 2's weights commercially available. Llama 2's license provides hints to Meta's goals - it prevents Llama Materials from being used to improve other models, competitors with more than 700 million monthly active users must request a license from Meta, and there are no trademark licenses. This suggests Llama 2 was open-sourced to reduce competitor moats, to attract more users and developers, and as a marketing tool.

[### Study claims ChatGPT is losing capability, but some experts aren‚Äôt convinced (7 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/is-chatgpt-getting-worse-over-time-study-claims-yes-but-others-arent-sure/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A paper published by researchers from Stanford University and the University of California shows that GPT-4's outputs have declined in quality over the past few months. While some experts aren't convinced by the paper, the lack of certainty around whether GPT-4's quality has declined points to a larger issue with how OpenAI handles its model releases. Popular theories about GPT-4's decline in performance include OpenAI reducing computational overhead, unintended effects from fine-tuning, and OpenAI reducing its abilities so more people will pay GitHub Copilot. OpenAI has consistently declined any claims that its models have decreased in capability.
