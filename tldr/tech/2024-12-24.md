[### M5 Pro chip could separate CPU and GPU in ‚Äòserver grade' chips (3 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/23/m5-pro-chip-could-separate-cpu-and-gpu-in-server-grade-chips/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's System-on-a-Chip (SoC) design tightly integrates all components, including both CPU and GPU, into a single package. TSMC's latest chip packaging process, known as SoIC-mH (System-on-Integrated-Chips-Molding-Horizontal), integrates different chips into a package in a way that improves thermal performance, allowing chips to run at full power for longer before they need to be throttled back to reduce heat. This approach may be used for the Pro, Max, and Ultra variants of the M5 chip. The M5 Pro chips will be used to power Apple Intelligence servers.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### How Hallucinatory A.I. Helps Science Dream Up Big Breakthroughs (9 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/23/science/ai-hallucinations-science.html?unlocked_article_code=1.j04.-_tE.s_GbP4D9PU2A&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI hallucinations can be remarkably useful. Scientists are using them to track cancer, design drugs, invent medical devices, uncover weather phenomena, and even win the Nobel Prize. This article looks at how AI hallucinations have been used to advance science. AI Hallucinations are giving scientists the chance to explore ideas they might not have thought about otherwise.

[### A Looming Threat to Bitcoin: The Risk of a Quantum Hack (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/a-looming-threat-to-bitcoin-the-risk-of-a-quantum-hack-24637e29?st=Gd775G&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Quantum computing could one day enable hackers to break the encryption that keeps bitcoin secure. A quantum device powerful enough to do this is still likely a decade or more away. The technology poses a long-term risk unless bitcoin's community of developers beef up its technology. A breakthrough that threatens bitcoin's security would also threaten many other industries, including traditional finance.

[### My colleague Julius (8 minute read)](https://ploum.net/2024-12-23-julius-en.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article tells the story of Julius, a guy who managed to succeed through his way with words. Julius would receive praise for his work despite knowing nothing about many of the things he worked on. People believed him even when he said things that made no sense. More knowledgeable people would be responsible for checking his work - these people knew how poor the work was, but management liked him so much they couldn't see it. His story is analogous to AI - Julius is now everywhere.

[### Venture Capital Partners Are Leaving Big Firms in Droves (7 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-23/why-vc-partners-are-leaving-firms-like-a16z-founders-fund-and-more?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNTAwOTIzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzM1NjE0MDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTT1k2UzdEV0xVNjkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.r_TVl4x-cvm2pqR0H3oq-xfVWpJfh_rSbgaIlZvOpvQ&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Dozens of investors at some of the biggest venture capital firms quit or were pushed out in 2024. An unusual number of investors are working on new firms. This is being caused by a protracted startup downturn and a broader shift in the role of VC firms. Bleak market conditions have led to less funding and leaner operations, so it makes sense for firms to employ fewer investors.
