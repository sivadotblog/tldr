[### How scientists engineered a see-through squid with its brain in plain view (4 minute read)](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/08/28/1196073961/how-scientists-engineered-a-see-through-squid-with-its-brain-in-plain-view?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have created a genetically altered version of the hummingbird bobtail squid using CRISPR technology. The squids are almost transparent unless light hits them at the right angle. These squids offer researchers a new way to study animals. They may be especially interesting to brain scientists. The team that created the squids is working to create more of the animals for other researchers.

[### Cost Limit for AWS (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/revant-io/cdk-cost-limit?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This repository contains a library of Amazon Cloud Development Kit constructs for deploying cost-aware, self-limiting resources. It helps developers set spending limits on AWS by disabling resources using non-destructive operations when budgets are hit. The library can be used to prevent large cloud bills due to mistakes in application code, misunderstanding of pricing models, or malicious activities.

[### Reports of the PC's death are greatly exaggerated, says IDC (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/29/pc_bounceback_idc/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Analysts estimate that the PC market will return to growth in 2024. PC shipments are forecast to grow 3.7% year-on-year. 2023 will likely be the year with the greatest annual decline in consumer PC shipments ever. The introduction of AI and the uncertainty surrounding the future of remote work are likely causing people to delay purchases. Windows 10 is set to retire in 2025, which will likely trigger some sales.

[### The Contrarian Strategy of OpenAI (3 minute read)](https://matt-rickard.com/the-contrarian-strategy-of-openai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI did many things differently than what Sam Altman would have advised for YC startups. It launched a solution in search of a problem with a capital-intensive business behind a login wall without any social, sharing, or other viral features. It took the company 4.5 years to launch its first commercial product. OpenAI fundraises through complicated financial structures. Altman is considering deleting his blog as he feels bad about the advice that he gave back when he was running YC.
