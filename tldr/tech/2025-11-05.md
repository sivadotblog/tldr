[### Goodbye low test coverage and slow QA cycles (Sponsor)](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=ACQ_All_Demo_Conversions__NewsletterAudience_-_Newsletter_GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_20251105-None_Experiment-FALSE&amp;utm_term=headline-GoodbyeLowTestCoverageAndSlowQACycles&amp;utm_content=GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_ScheduleADemoToLearnMore_None_Headline%3AGoodbyeLowTestCoverageAndSlowQACycles____Newsletter-PrimaryPlacement_20251105_v1_)

Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there) is hard and pricey for any team.

Elon Musk spent most of his time at xAI after he left DOGE in May, even holding meetings for Tesla employees at xAI's offices. Musk has balanced his responsibilities between several fast-growing companies for years, but the potential of AI has led him to spend much more of his time at xAI. Tesla will soon announce preliminary results on a giant pay package designed to ensure that Musk focuses on Tesla for years to come. The package would increase his stake in Tesla over a decade from 15% to around 25% if he hits ambitious goals.

Apple is developing an entry-level budget Mac designed for students, businesses, and casual users. The low-cost laptop is currently in active testing at Apple and in early production with overseas suppliers. It will be priced well under $1,000. Apple plans to launch it in the first half of next year. The move is a strategic shift for Apple, which has previously vowed not to chase market share with lower-end offerings.

[### Meet Project Suncatcher, Google's plan to put AI data centers in space (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/meet-project-suncatcher-googles-plan-to-put-ai-data-centers-in-space/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The cost of electricity on Earth is a problem for large data centers. Google plans to put data centers in space in a dawn-dusk sun-synchronous low-earth orbit to ensure they get almost constant sunlight exposure. It will require solar panels that are up to eight times more efficient to get the job done. The project will only be successful if Google's TPUs can run for at least five years. Google plans to launch a pair of prototype satellites by early 2027.

[### High-Performance Syntax Highlighting with CSS Highlights API (8 minute read)](https://pavi2410.com/blog/high-performance-syntax-highlighting-with-css-highlights-api/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The CSS Custom Highlight API lets developers style arbitrary text ranges without modifying the DOM structure. Developers just have to define 'Range' objects that point to a specific character position in text nodes, group them by style type, and register them with the browser's highlight registry. The API is supported in all modern browsers. This post provides an example implementation of syntax highlighting using the CSS Highlights API.

[### Why AC is cheap, but AC repair is a luxury (18 minute read)](https://a16z.substack.com/p/why-ac-is-cheap-but-ac-repair-is?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Huge bursts of productivity concentrated in one industry are great because they create a huge number of new jobs and new opportunities, but this has an interesting spillover effect: the more jobs and opportunities created by the productivity boom, the more wages increase in other industries. These industries still have to compete in the same labor market. As the AI supercycle plays out, some goods and services will become orders of magnitude cheaper, while others will become more expensive - but we'll consume more of them anyway. This effect will even be seen within a single job - some work will see 10x throughput at 10x the quality, while other work, which must be done by humans, will command a wildly high wage.

[### How I use AI (15 minute read)](https://ben.stolovitz.com/posts/how_use_ai_oct_2025/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI has transformed how some developers work. We are just starting to see what the technology can achieve. We still haven't fully explored what current models can do. There are some concerning possibilities with the future of the technology, but for now, it is still in its 'wondrous' stage.
