[### Apple is already designing a lighter Vision Pro to fix ‚Äúneck strain‚Äù (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/report-apple-is-already-designing-a-lighter-vision-pro-to-fix-neck-strain/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple has a long history of releasing intriguing first-generation devices followed by second- or third-generation revisions that realize the full potential of the original idea. The company is already working on a next-generation version of its Vision Pro to address early complaints about the yet-to-be-released first-generation model. It aims to reduce the device's size and weight as it is apparently causing neck strain among some testers. The company is also considering changing the way prescription lenses are built into the headset and looking into a lower-end model.

[### GitHub Copilot Loses an Average of $20 Per User Per Month (2 minute read)](https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/290661/report-github-copilot-loses-an-average-of-20-per-user-per-month?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

GitHub Copilot costs users $10 per month, but it is costing Microsoft an average of $20 per user per month. Some users are costing the company as much as $80 per month. This is likely why Microsoft decided to charge a lot more for the AI capabilities in Microsoft 365 Copilot. The costs are also likely why the company is developing its own in-house AI chip sets for its data centers and pushing the adoption of Neural Processing Units across the industry.

[### Extreme Parkour with Legged Robots (1 minute read)](https://extreme-parkour.github.io/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This study is an attempt at developing robot parkour on a small low-cost robot with imprecise actuation and a single front-facing depth camera for perception. It shows how a single neural net policy operating directly from a camera image can overcome imprecise sensing and actuation to output highly precise control behavior end-to-end. The resulting robot is able to high jump on obstacles two times its height, long jump gaps two times its length, do handstands, run across tilted ramps, and more. A video of the robot performing different movements is available.

FTX staff witnessed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto being stolen in real time on November 11, 2022. The company quickly assembled a team to save the assets. It decided to contact BitGo, which had been in talks with FTX for custody of its crypto holdings, to request the immediate creation of cold storage wallets. While BitGo was creating the wallets, FTX temporarily stored its assets on an employee's personal Ledger Nano hardware wallet. The siphoning of funds stopped once the money was moved to the new wallet and the rescued crypto was eventually transferred to BitGo.
