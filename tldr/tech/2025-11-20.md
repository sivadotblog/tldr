[### 61% of leaders spend more time proving security rather than improving it (Sponsor)](https://www.vanta.com/state-of-trust/global?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=fy26q3_content_state_of_trust_global)

AI-driven attacks are getting bigger, faster, and more sophisticated. But Vanta's newest [State of Trust](https://www.vanta.com/state-of-trust/global?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=fy26q3_content_state_of_trust_global) survey of 3,500 leaders shows that businesses are spending way more time and energy proving trust than building it:

>> 61% of leaders spend more time proving security rather than improving it

>> 59% note that AI risks outpace their expertise

>> But 95% say AI is making their security teams more effective

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### New nanoparticle mRNA vaccine may be cheaper and 100 times more powerful (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/medical-tech/nanoparticle-mrna-vaccine-cheaper-more-powerful/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at MIT have developed a new lipid nanoparticle that enhances the effectiveness of an mRNA vaccine by a hundred times compared to stand-alone effectiveness in mice. The system could be used to develop vaccines for a number of diseases, including COVID-19 and influenza. By increasing potency and reducing cost per dosage, the system could become an inexpensive way to combat many infectious diseases. It could also help improve the efficacy of some vaccines.

[### Aging as a disease: The rise of longevity science (13 minute read)](https://bigthink.com/health/progress-conference-2025-longevity/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The frontier of medicine is shifting from fighting disease to pursuing more life. Speakers at the recent Progress Conference 2025 held at Lighthaven spoke about extending life by addressing the biological hallmarks of aging itself: genomic instability, telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular senescence. The new frontier is to find targeted interventions that impact these factors. The pursuit of longevity, not survival, is still in its early days. Research is happening largely along non-traditional paths and with non-traditional funding and support models.

[### Companies Are Warming Up to Saying AI Is the Reason for Job Cuts (8 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-19/ai-cited-in-more-job-cut-news-adding-to-labor-market-pain?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzYxMDI4MCwiZXhwIjoxNzY0MjE1MDgwLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVlaWDNHUFFRNzgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.CdetZ7JDhLiOFUgE0iVkOuuhOj-tKCIdalrRuqIGw7I&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI was referenced in roughly a fifth of total job cuts announced in the US last month. Executives have been touting efficiency gains from AI as a reason for a shrinking or flat workforce. Even when companies aren't saying AI helps eliminate jobs, they are mentioning it as a reason to raise the bar on new hires. There is still some uncertainty about how useful AI tools are and how to fit them into daily work - if tech firms can ease that uncertainty, it may open the door to wider corporate AI adoption.

[### The FTC's Meta Antitrust Implosion (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/ftc-meta-antitrust-case-james-boasberg-whatsapp-instagram-facebook-1592b4fc?st=mCKVR2&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta worked to make Instagram and WhatsApp successful by improving their design and increasing their revenue. The company has been forced to evolve in response to competition, increasing smartphone usage, and a massive leap in AI-powered algorithms. To prove that Meta holds a monopoly would require proving that TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, and X aren't real competitors. Meta's enormous profits aren't evidence of monopoly power.
