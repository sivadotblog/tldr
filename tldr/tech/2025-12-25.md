SpaceX's Starlink satellite service has surpassed 9 million active customers and is adding over 20,000 new users per day. Serving in over 155 countries, territories, and markets, the Starlink satellite constellation now has more than 9,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites. The growth rate reflects the rising demand for broadband in underserved regions. SpaceX may be positioning itself for an initial public offering as soon as next year, and Elon Musk has suggested in the past that Starlink could have its own IPO in the future.

A virtual cell is a model that lets researchers model diseases and treatments. Tied with the push for virtual cells are efforts to build a foundational model, similar to AlphaFold. Researchers will need to create their own datasets to answer specific questions to be successful in the field. This will require models that have the ability to explicitly identify, isolate, and subtract confounding noise.

[### Package managers keep using git as a database, it never works out (9 minute read)](https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/24/package-managers-keep-using-git-as-a-database.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Git was designed to be a distributed collaboration tool for source code. It wasn't designed to be used as a database for package registries. Package managers who use git as an index all had to build workarounds as they grew, causing pain for users and maintainers. Package registries need fast point queries for metadata.

Most new financial services companies will be built on stablecoin rails in the next decade. Stablecoin rails unlock programmable money, access to internet capital markets where genuinely new financial primitives are being built every day, and the ability to let agents manage funds with real guarantees. This is an opportunity to rethink what financial services should actually look like. Most of the industry is still running on the 2015 fintech playbook on new rails.

[### OpenAI has started mocking up what ads in ChatGPT could look like (2 minute read)](https://sherwood.news/tech/report-openai-has-started-mocking-up-what-ads-in-chatgpt-could-look-like/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI employees have reportedly started discussions on different ways to prioritize sponsored information in ChatGPT. The company is considering giving priority placement to sponsored results when users are clearly talking about buying a product, showing ads based on user information, or a sponsored sidebar that shows ads relevant to the conversation. OpenAI is wary about turning off users, as they might not trust a chatbot that injects ads into sensitive conversations. The pressure to increase revenue is building on OpenAI, which signed a flurry of massive deals this year that it will have to pay for.
