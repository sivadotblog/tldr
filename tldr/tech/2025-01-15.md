[### TikTok preparing for U.S. shut-off on Sunday (3 minute read)](https://www.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-preparing-us-shut-off-041323685.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

TikTok is planning to shut off its app for US users on Sunday. The federal law banning the app only mandates a ban on new downloads - existing users will still be able to use the app for some time. Users will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban. TikTok plans to give users the option to download all of their data so they can take a record of their personal information with them.

OpenAI's new Tasks feature for ChatGPT allows users to direct the chatbot to send reminders or to generate responses to specific prompts at certain times. It is now available to Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers. ChatGPT will sometimes suggest tasks, but they won't go into effect unless the user approves them. Users can make changes to assigned tasks through the chat conversation or through a new Tasks section of the app. There is currently a 10-task limit.

[### Boom XB-1 pushes the sound barrier before supersonic flight (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/boom-xb-1-pushes-sound-barrier-before-supersonic-flight/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Boom Supersonic XB-1 prototype reached a transonic speed of Mach 0.95 during Test Flight 11 on January 10. Transonic speed is when some areas of the airflow over the airframe exceed the speed of sound. During the flight, the XB-1 was subjected to dynamic pressures of up to 383 Knots Equivalent Air Speed, which is a pressure greater than what it would experience when flying supersonic at Mach 1.1. The company has now completed 11 test flights, each incrementing to reach supersonic speed.

Colossal Biosciences, a company that aims to bring back extinct species, says that it expects the first woolly mammoth calves to be born within the next three years. The company plans to start with the birthing of small mammals outside of the womb and then work up to the birthing of elephants, which will pave the way for mammoth births. While Colossal doesn't work on human applications for its technology, it has acknowledged the potential of its technology for use in IVF clinics. Colossal also plans to bring back the Tasmanian tiger and the dodo - its long-term goal is to work with countries all over the world to bring back extinct species and protect endangered animals.

[### What's involved in getting a "modern" terminal setup? (11 minute read)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/01/11/getting-a-modern-terminal-setup/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A modern terminal needs to have multiline support for copy and paste, infinite shell history, a useful prompt, 24-bit color, clipboard integration, good autocomplete, colors in ls, themes, automatic terminal fixing, key bindings, and the ability to use the scroll wheel. This article discusses how to implement all these features into a terminal. It explains why it makes certain recommendations and how the setup benefits developers. There is no perfect way to configure things in the terminal to make it compatible with every single other thing, so developers need to try things out, figure out a locally stable state that works for them, and accept that new tools might disrupt their workflow.

Data scarcity has led AI developers to look for new ways to get unique data. Documents from a major copyright lawsuit against Meta show internal discussions about avoiding media coverage suggesting that the company used a dataset it knew to be pirated. It reportedly used the book piracy site LibGen to train its AI systems. The documents hint that OpenAI and Mistral may also be using the library for their models. Meta and other AI companies have previously argued that using copyrighted material in training data should constitute legal fair use.
