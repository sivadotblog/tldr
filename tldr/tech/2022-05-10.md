[### 'An army of robots' and zero human workers will build a dam in China (4 minute read)](https://www.asiaone.com/digital/army-robots-and-zero-human-workers-will-build-dam-china?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China is building a dam project on the Tibetan Plateau using artificial intelligence and unmanned machinery. It will build the dam using a similar process to 3D printing. The dam will be capable of producing nearly five billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year once it is completed in 2024. Some jobs will still be handled by humans due to task complexity. Construction robots can help offset the decline of manual labor caused by low birth rates.

[### Brilliant Planet plans cheap, gigaton-scale carbon capture using algae (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/environment/brilliant-planet-algae-carbon-sequestration/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Brilliant Planet is a company that has a carbon capture and sequestration model that can scale up to billions of tons per year. The method involves pumping seawater into low-cost coastal desert land and then using the pools of seawater to grow algae. It could potentially capture two billion tons of carbon per year, about 5.5% of humanity's annual global carbon emissions. The company is aiming for a cost of around $50-$100 per ton, which is significantly cheaper than other current options.

[### Why ‚ÄòDe-Extinction‚Äô Is Impossible, But Could Work Anyway (7 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-de-extinction-is-impossible-but-could-work-anyway-20220509/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

De-extinction is not possible as even slight alterations in gene order can have significant effects. Even with 100% of an animal's genetic code, scientists can only create organisms with the same gene order and chromosome count as its living relatives. While de-extinction may be impossible, it is possible to create functional equivalents through breeding or gene insertion. This can be used to introduce species back into environments to benefit ecosystems.
