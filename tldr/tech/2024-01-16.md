[### Tesla Optimus robot can‚Äôt build cars yet, but it is folding clothes (3 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2024/01/15/tesla-optimus-robot-cant-build-cars-folding-clothes/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk has shared a video of Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot folding a shirt. The project has come a long way since a very early prototype was shown at Tesla AI Day 2022. Tesla aims to eventually have the robot in people's homes performing a wide range of tasks, but it first plans to have them in its own manufacturing operations for repetitive and or dangerous tasks. The video of the robot folding a shirt is available in the article.

[### YouTube appears to be reducing video and site performance for ad-block users (1 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/youtube-appears-to-be-reducing-video-and-site-performance-for-ad-block-users/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

YouTube appears to be slowing down the site for ad-block users. Turning off ad blockers immediately improves loading performance for affected users. The ad-block detection causes strange issues, like a lag that makes full-screen and comments not work or Chrome being unable to load other webpages while YouTube is open. The slowdowns may be due to ad blockers altering YouTube's code and unrelated to YouTube.

[### ID of five subtypes of Alzheimer's has huge implications for treatment (5 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/medical/five-subtypes-alzheimers-identified/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An international team of neuroscientists has identified five distinct subtypes of Alzheimer's disease. The finding has breakthrough implications for treatment approaches and efficacy. The subtypes can be identified by the categories of fluid surrounding the brains of patients. Each of the five subtypes is linked to a unique genetic risk profile. They reveal different molecular pathways to what has traditionally been considered as one overall disease.

[### New solid state battery charges in minutes, lasts for thousands of cycles (4 minute read)](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/01/15/new-solid-state-battery-charges-in-minutes-lasts-for-thousands-of-cycles/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at Harvard John A. Paulson SEAS have developed a new lithium metal battery that can be charged in minutes and lasts at least 6,000 charging cycles. Lithium metal batteries offer far better energy density and much lower weight than their lithium-ion counterparts. The team has a list of other materials that could potentially yield similar performance. The technology has been licensed through a Harvard spinoff company that has scaled it up to build a smartphone-sized pouch cell battery.

[### Slashing Data Transfer Costs in AWS by 99% (8 minute read)](https://www.bitsand.cloud/posts/slashing-data-transfer-costs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

One of the easiest ways to accidentally spend too much money on AWS is by carelessly transferring data. Any application that involves sending data between resources in different availability zones will incur such charges. These prices easily add up and are an extremely high-margin source of profit for cloud providers. This article looks at how to set up cross-availability zone infrastructure without paying for data transfer costs. It suggests using S3, which already replicates data between availability zones as part of its service.

[### Elon Musk wants more control of Tesla, seeks 25% voting power (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/16/elon-musk-wants-more-control-of-tesla-seeks-25percent-voting-power.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk said on Monday that he wants about 25% of voting control over Tesla. Musk already owns around 13% of the company. He says that he is uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics without having the control. He wants to be influential, but not so much that he can't be overturned. The bid for more control will add to the pressure on Tesla's board of directors, who is already facing investor concerns over several issues, including Musk's split focus, the use of company resources, and federal probes.
