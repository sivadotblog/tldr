An experimental drug called valiltramiprosate (ALZ-801) slowed cognitive decline by 52% in people with mild cognitive impairment in a study of more than 300 people aged 50 or older who were genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's disease.

It works by preventing amyloid proteins from clumping and forming plaques.
