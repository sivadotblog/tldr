Anthropic is raising up to $5 billion in a series C fundraising round to rival OpenAI and expand into over a dozen major industries. The company plans to build a 'frontier model' called Claude-next that is ten times more capable than today's best AI. Claude-Next will use a next-gen algorithm for AI self-teaching. It will require spending $1 billion within the next 18 months to develop. Anthropic estimates the frontier model will require several orders of magnitude more processing power than even the most massive models today.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Synthetic embryos have been implanted into monkey wombs (5 minute read)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/06/1071112/synthetic-embryos-have-been-implanted-into-monkey-wombs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have generated synthetic embryos from monkey stem cells for the first time. The embryos were transferred to the uterus of adult monkeys, leading to initial signs of pregnancy. Although the embryos ceased development within 20 days of transfer, this work represents the furthest progress made so far toward developing lab-grown embryos in primates. This breakthrough suggests the possibility of generating human fetuses using stem cells instead of sperm and egg.

A genome-wide association study in the US indicates a relationship between genetic factors and inflammatory gut microflora in healthy brain function. The study found a genetic connection between specific genera of gut bacteria and Alzheimer's disease. It also found a link between the microbes and a genetic risk factor for the neurodegenerative disorder and revealed protective bacterial groups which can counter inflammation.

[### Chrome ships WebGPU (3 minute read)](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-release/)

WebGPU is now available on Chrome 113 by default. WebGPU is a new web graphics API that allows for more flexible GPU programming and offers access to advanced capabilities that WebGL does not provide. It exposes modern hardware capabilities, allowing rendering and computation operations on a GPU. WebGPU significantly reduces the JavaScript workload for the same graphics and offers more than three times the improvements in machine learning model inferences. It is currently only available on ChromeOS, macOS, and Windows. WebGPU support for other platforms is coming later this year.
