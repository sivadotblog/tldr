Warner has urged shareholders to reject Paramount's hostile takeover bid due to concerns about the financing. Paramount is using an Ellison family trust to backstop the deal - Warner wants Larry Ellison to give a stronger personal guarantee that he is fully committed to the bid.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order outlining NASA's policy objectives for the next three years a couple of hours after a judge formally swore Jared Isaacman as the agency's administrator. The executive order states that the country must pursue a space policy that will extend the reach of human discovery, secure the nation's vital economic and security interests, unleash commercial development, and lay the foundation for a new space age. There are no concrete plans to send humans to Mars in the document. There's also a lack of reference to space science. An overview of the contents of the executive order is available in the article.

[### Cloudflare's latest outage proves dangers of global configuration changes (8 minute read)](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-pulse-cloudflares-latest-outage/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cloudflare's most recent outage was caused by a seemingly innocent but global configuration change. The incident shows why the largest systems in the world will have to implement safer ways to roll out configs. Implementing gradual rollouts for all configuration files is a lot of work, so it doesn't make sense unless the stability of systems is more important than fast iteration. Smaller companies and products probably won't need to implement staged configuration rollouts because the infrastructure work slows down product development.
