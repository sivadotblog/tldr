[### SpaceX completes sixth Starship flight, splashes down both booster and spacecraft (5 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/watch-spacex-launch-starship-sixth-test-flight.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX launched the sixth Starship test flight yesterday near Brownsville, Texas, before intentionally splashing down in the Indian Ocean an hour later. The company had originally aimed to catch the rocket's Super Heavy booster with its launch tower but decided to splash down the booster in the Gulf of Mexico instead as it did not clear the 'commit criteria' needed for the catch attempt. This was the first time Starship made a daylight splashdown in the Indian Ocean. Video of the flight test is available in the article.

The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has unveiled the world's fastest supercomputer, El Capitan. El Capitan can perform over 2,700 quadrillion operations per second at its peak. It will be used to model and predict nuclear weapon performance, aging effects, and safety. It will also aid in fusion and AI projects. Planning for the system began in 2018, with construction starting four years ago. El Capitan was built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which has built all of the current top 3 supercomputers.

A study in which rats were taught how to drive found that rats housed in enriched environments learned to drive faster than those in standard cages. The finding supports the idea that complex environments enhance neuroplasticity. The study found that the rats had an intense motivation for their driving training. Its results suggest that anticipating positive experiences may help drive persistence to keep searching for life's rewards. Pictures and videos of the rats and their automobiles are available in the article.
