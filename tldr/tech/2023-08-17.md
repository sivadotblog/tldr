[### Self-driving car bets (40 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZRrYsZ626KSEgHv8s/self-driving-car-bets?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While investors were optimistic enough to bet on self-driving cars back in 2016, most experts and people in tech thought it was pretty unlikely to be ready by 2023. People seem to treat self-driving as if it were an easy AI problem, but perceiving and quickly reacting to the world is something that we evolved to be good at, and driving sometimes requires complex problem-solving. There is a big gap between 'pretty good' and 'actually good enough'.

[### The Next Next Job, a framework for making big career decisions (13 minute read)](https://andrewchen.com/the-next-next-job/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The 'Next Next Job' framework involves reflecting on what job you want to be your next next job and why you can't get it right now. After identifying what you want, you can work backwards from that and plan your career accordingly. We often don't know what our next next job might be, but thinking about it helps when making major decisions as you know what you are working towards. It can also help you realize that you might already be qualified for what you want to do, or help you figure out what gaps you have to cover to get where you want to go.
