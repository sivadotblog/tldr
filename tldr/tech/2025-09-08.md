[### Tesla Proposes Musk Pay Package Worth as Much as $1 Trillion Over Decade (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/tesla-board-proposes-musk-pay-package-worth-as-much-as-1-trillion-over-decade-6bc5e449?st=fuN1DS&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla's board is asking investors to approve a pay package that could deliver Elon Musk as much as $1 trillion in stock over the next decade. The deal would allow Musk to receive installments of shares if Tesla hits a series of market capitalization and business milestones. The maximum payout would give him an additional 12% stake in Tesla, but the company would have to reach a market value nearly eight times its current valuation. The unprecedented pay package is aimed at keeping Musk focused on the company.

Apple plans to announce its next-generation iPhone lineup, new smartwatches, and other peripherals at a product launch event tomorrow. There will be four new iPhone models, including what will likely be called the iPhone 17 Air, a model approximately one-third thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro. It will have the same A19 processor as the iPhone 17, but can only support eSIMs due to its thin frame. More about what to expect from tomorrow's event is available in the article.

[### Hope for diabetes: CRISPR-edited cells pump out insulin in a person ‚Äì and evade immune detection (4 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02802-5?utm_source=x&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nature&amp;linkId=16629254)

Sana Biotechnology, a firm in Seattle, Washington, has successfully implanted CRISPR-edited pancreas cells into a person with type 1 diabetes without the need for immune-dampening drugs. The cells, collected from a deceased donor, were able to produce insulin for months. Currently, the only way for someone with type 1 diabetes to avoid dependence on injected insulin is through the transplantation of cadaveric islet cells, but this requires lifelong immune-suppressing drug therapy. Sana's solution bypasses the need for those drugs entirely.

[### Elon Musk: Neuralink could restore partial vision to the blind next year (3 minute read)](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-neuralink-restore-partial-vision-blind-next-year/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Neuralink could attempt to restore limited sight to visually impaired patients as early as 2026. Blindsight is a brain-computer interface designed to restore vision. It targets the brain's visual cortex to generate visual perception, which means that vision could be restored even for people who were born blind. Blindsight has received a 'breakthrough device' designation from the US FDA.

[### Engineering excellence starts on edge (3 minute read)](https://world.hey.com/dhh/engineering-excellence-starts-on-edge-c36e4c59?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The best engineering teams develop their own tools while running production code on edge, where progress is made. When programmers are able to directly influence the tools they're working with, they're likely to do so, which makes them learn more. However, this requires being able to immediately use the improvements or bug fixes they helped devise - it doesn't work if they have to sit and wait for the next release. Bug-free frameworks and libraries take work, but the reward is increased engineering excellence.

Chad Nelson, a creative specialist at OpenAI, is making a feature-length movie using AI. Expected to be released in theaters globally next year, Critterz is a story about forest creatures who go on an adventure after their village is disrupted by a stranger. Nelson has teamed up with production companies in London and Los Angeles to debut the film at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The team is attempting to make the movie in about nine months instead of the three years it would typically take. It has a budget of less than $30 million, far less than what animated films typically cost.

[### No, AI Is Not a Bubble (5 minute read)](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/no-ai-is-not-a-bubble?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=website)

Bubbles are false beliefs about reality that everyone eventually figures out were false. The dot-com bubble that popped was the idea that businesses would become instantly rich just by being on the internet. People no longer believe that just adding AI to products will make them instant millionaires. The idea that modern AI will significantly transform business and the global economy, leading to massive unemployment for knowledge workers, is not a bubble.
