[### A Few Social Media Influencers Are Shaping AI (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/social-media-ai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An analysis of more than 8,000 AI and ML papers found that papers shared by two specific influencers had a median citation count two to three times higher than those from a control group. Academic citations affect decisions like research funding and tenure at academic institutions. The correlation between influencer tweets and citation count points to a shift in how the community finds and reads papers. The overwhelming volume of papers published daily makes it impractical for individuals to sift through feeds, so the community is relying on curators to highlight noteworthy papers.

There isn't really an 'AI market' - the market for chatbots and SEO tools is the same as before, just with more competition. AI startups that don't embrace this reality will likely fail.
