[### Apple‚Äôs App Store can stay closed but developers can link to outside payments, says appeals court (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/24/23696245/apple-appeal-epic-games-lawsuit-antitrust?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An appeals court has found that Apple's closed App Store and security restrictions don't violate antitrust law. Apple is still required to allow users to learn about alternate payment options. iOS developers are free to send customers to other places to make payments to avoid paying Apple a commission. Apple has recently taken steps to address mounting antitrust concerns, including introducing ways for reader apps to link to their own sites to bypass Apple's in-app payment system.
