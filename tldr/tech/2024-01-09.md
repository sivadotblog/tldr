[### Waymo‚Äôs driverless cars are finally ready for the highway (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24029932/waymo-driverless-highway-trips-phoenix-speed-testing?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Waymo's fully driverless vehicles will soon start carrying passengers to and from their destinations on Phoenix's freeways. The company will start by offering driverless rides to just employees and their friends before opening up the service to other paying passengers. Waymo will use the data and feedback collected from these passengers to improve the service as it increases the number of miles it drives on highways. Using highways will allow Waymo to provide faster routes, especially for customers traveling to Phoenix's airports.

[### from LG to samsung, transparent LED displays that project films on glass shake up CES 2024 (3 minute read)](https://www.designboom.com/technology/lg-samsung-transparent-led-displays-tv-glass-ces-2024-01-08-2024/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

LG and Samsung have unveiled transparent LED displays that project movies and images on glass-like holograms. LG's Signature OLED TV has a single see-through glass display that uses wireless AV transmission and reception technology to eliminate all kinds of wires other than the power source around the transparent screen. Samsung's transparent MICRO LED display can animate motionless surroundings and objects. Pictures and videos of both displays are available in the article.

[### Scientists restore vision in mice, achieve 170-fold gene editing boost (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/scientists-gene-editing-170-times?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at MIT and Harvard have designed tiny virus-like particles that can carry prime editors into mouse cells with a high success rate to correct a genetic disorder. The technique improves the editing process by 170 times in human cells. It was able to correct genetic mistakes and restore vision when tested on mice with genetic eye problems without creating any unintended changes.

[### Attacks on machine learning models (7 minute read)](https://rnikhil.com/2024/01/07/attacking-neural-networks.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This blog attempts to shine a light on the topic of attacks on machine learning models. It aims to inform readers about neural network attacks, a topic worthy of attention for those deploying machine learning models in production. Machine learning models are just as susceptible to attacks as other systems, but they are extra hard to protect as they have both code and data vulnerabilities. Current defenses are not enough, and real fixes may require massive changes to model development. As long as model development involves pattern matching, attacks can never be truly prevented.
