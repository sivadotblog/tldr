Most AI code review tools analyze the diff. Sometimes the file, occasionally the repo.

That's not how experienced engineers work.

Instead, they remember the Slack thread that explains this database pattern. They know David on the platform team has strong opinions about error handling. They've internalized dozens of unwritten conventions.

[Unblocked](https://getunblocked.com/code-review/?utm_source=tldrtech&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=codereview&utm_content=260204_primary) is the only AI code review tool that uses codebase, docs, and discussions to give high-signal feedback based on [how your system actually works](https://getunblocked.com/code-review/?utm_source=tldrtech&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=codereview&utm_content=260204_primary) – instead of flooding your PR with stylistic nitpicks.

[### In Surprising Move, HP CEO Steps Down to Lead PayPal (2 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/in-surprising-move-hp-ceo-steps-down-to-lead-paypal?test_uuid=04IpBmWGZleS0I0J3epvMrC&test_variant=B&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

HP CEO Enrique Lores will replace PayPal's previous CEO, Alex Chriss, starting March 1. Lores has served on the PayPal board for nearly five years and as Board Chair since July 2024.

HP has named board member Bruce Broussard as interim CEO.

[### AV Rideshare Fleet Sizing: Why the Optimum is Just Shy of Peak (11 minute read)](https://www.platformaeronaut.com/p/av-rideshare-fleet-sizing-why-the?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The optimal fleet size for automatic vehicles is not peak demand, but it's also not average. The economic optimum is 98-99% demand coverage for most operators. Oversizing fleets destroys pricing power faster than it increases utilization. AV unit economics only work with aggressive off-peak price differentiation.

[### Data centers in space makes no sense (2 minute read)](https://civai.org/blog/space-data-centers?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Data centers in space face massive challenges such as radiation, cooling, latency, and launch costs. There are other fundamental issues that make them unfeasible: competing in the market would require launching hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of satellites into space, and satellites can't be upgraded at scale. Data centers in space only make sense if they are cost-effective relative to normal data centers. The idea makes less and less sense with every improvement in normal energy production.

[### Sam Altman Reveals Why OpenAI Is Poised To Make The Biggest Business Bets Ever (23 minute read)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2026/02/03/sam-altman-explains-the-future/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sam Altman has a tendency to race ahead with ideas that excite him. While it is a tentpole of his success, it has gotten him in trouble in the past. Altman's itch to release products quickly is informed by his study of Xerox PARC, a legendary Silicon Valley research lab known for inventing the modern graphical user interface, laser printers, and the computer mouse, yet failing to commercialize any of them. Altman's reputation for shiny object syndrome can be harmful - OpenAI has been criticized in the past for releasing products without proper safety testing and for shipping features that prioritize engagement over psychological well-being.
