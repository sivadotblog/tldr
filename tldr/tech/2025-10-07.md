Manual testing on personal devices is too slow and too limited. It forces teams to cut releases a week early just to test before submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage, issues slip through.

[### OpenAI launches apps inside of ChatGPT (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/openai-launches-apps-inside-of-chatgpt/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

ChatGPT users can now access interactive applications from companies like Booking.com, Spotify, Figma, and Canva right inside the conversation. OpenAI is trying to build an ecosystem of apps that can be launched directly in ChatGPT's responses, letting users call up third-party tools in their conversations. It has launched a preview of its Apps SDK for developers to start building apps. OpenAI says the new system is built using the Model Context Protocol, which allows developers to connect data sources to AI systems.

OpenAI and AMD have announced a multibillion-dollar partnership to collaborate on data centers running on AMD processors. OpenAI has committed to purchasing 6 gigawatts worth of AMD chips starting with the MI450 chip next year. The deal is AMD's biggest win against Nvidia's dominance in the artificial intelligence space. OpenAI plans to use the AMD chips for inference functions.

SpaceX has signed a $17 billion deal to buy spectrum licenses from EchoStar. The deal will help Starlink satellites deliver better service to smartphones. SpaceX will acquire EchoStar's AWS-4 and H-block spectrum licenses, giving it the rights to 50 MHz of spectrum in the 1.9 and lower 2 GHz spectrum bands. The spectrum will allow SpaceX to provide phone, text, and broadband services from space to mobile users globally.

[### Discovery of cells that keep immune responses in check wins medicine Nobel Prize (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/discovery-of-cells-that-keep-immune-responses-in-check-wins-medicine-nobel-prize/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi were awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work in the discovery of specialized immune cells that keep potentially harmful immune responses in check. These regulatory T cells play a key role in peripheral immune tolerance, a non-central process that allows the immune system to balance its response. The discovery has opened up new lines of research into peripheral immune tolerance. Researchers are now working on manipulating T cells so that they can't protect cancerous tumors, engineering them to treat autoimmune diseases, and recruiting them to protect transplanted organs and tissues.

xAI is preparing to build a new plant in Memphis capable of generating over a gigawatt of electricity to power a million-square-foot data center that is also under development nearby. The Colossus data center houses over 200,000 Nvidia chips and powers the technology behind Grok, xAI's AI chatbot. xAI is close to finishing another bigger facility called Colossus 2. Colossus 2 will have a total of 550,000 chips and cost tens of billions of dollars.

[### US v. Google: What Each Side Argued for Fixing Google's Ad Tech Monopoly (6 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/technology/google-ad-tech-arguments.html?unlocked_article_code=1.rk8.bIFd.7IbzQLaAZdPn&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Justice Department and Google spent two weeks arguing over how to address Google's illegal monopoly in advertising software. The government argued that the only way to end Google's dominance in ad tech is to force a breakup and make Google sell the software that connects the buyers and sellers of ad space. Google says that the proposal was too complicated to pull off without harming publishers and instead proposed that the company make its systems work better with products produced by its competitors. The judge presiding over the case will reach a decision in the coming months.
