[### Google research AI image noise reduction is out of this world (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/23/nerf-in-the-dark/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

MultiNeRF is a project from Google Research that includes algorithms that can figure out what images should look like without noise generated by imaging sensors. The algorithms can remove noise from images to significantly improve their quality, especially in low-light scenes. They can also vary exposure, tone maps, viewpoints, and focus. A video showcasing the technology is available.

[### TikTok is testing a new ‚ÄòNearby‚Äô feed to display local content (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/23/tiktok-testing-nearby-feed/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

TikTok is testing a 'Nearby' feed designed to display local content to users in Southeast Asia. Users who are part of the test will see a new feed tab displayed alongside the 'Following' and 'For You' feeds. The feed is testing alongside a feature that lets creators add location tags to their videos. It could open up new opportunities for local advertisers and help users discover nearby venues and products. TikTok says the feature may change before launch or be scrapped altogether.

[### NASA Recorded The Sound From a Black Hole, and It's Super Eerie (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-recorded-the-sound-from-a-black-hole-and-its-super-eerie?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NASA has released an audio clip of sound waves from a supermassive black hole located 250 million light-years away. The waves had to be transposed up 57 and 58 octaves to be audible to humans. They include the lowest note in the Universe ever detected by humans, a B-flat just over 57 octaves below middle C. Sound waves may play a vital role in the evolution of galaxy clusters over long periods of time. The audio clip is available in the article.

[### First material found to "remember" its own history (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/materials/vanadium-dioxide-memory-material/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a material that is normally an insulator, but it changes structure and acts like a metal when heated to 68 degrees Celsius. It can conduct electricity without conducting heat. A team of scientists recently discovered that VO2 can 'remember' phase transitions for at least three hours. It is the only material known so far to behave this way. The discovery could lead to a new class of memory and data processing devices.

[### Twitter‚Äôs former security chief says company lied about bots and safety (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/23/23317857/twitter-whistleblower-zatko-security-spam-safety?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Twitter's former head of security has accused the company of negligent security practices. He claims that Twitter misled federal regulators about its safety and that the company fails to properly estimate the number of bots on its platform. About half of Twitter's 7,000 or so full-time employees have access to users' sensitive personal data and internal software. Twitter has failed to delete user data in the past as the records were spread too widely among internal systems to be tracked. The company could face significant fines if the accusations are proven to be correct.
