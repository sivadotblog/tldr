[### SpaceX Tips 'Starlink Community' for Cheaper, Shared Satellite Internet Access (4 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-tips-starlink-community-for-cheaper-shared-satellite-internet-access?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Starlink Community is a new option that makes Starlink more accessible. It allows multiple subscribers to share access to a single satellite dish for a lower fee of $60 per month. Each subscriber will need their own Wi-Fi router. The service may be targeting apartment complexes without access to stable high-speed broadband. It is unclear when the service will launch.

[### Tesla awards Musk $29 billion in shares with prior pay package in limbo (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/tesla-stock-musk-pay.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla's board has awarded Elon Musk an interim pay package of 96 million shares worth about $29 billion. The package includes shares that vest in two years as long as Musk continues as CEO or in another key executive position. It will be forfeited if the legal battle over Musk's 2017 compensation ends with him being able to exercise shares from that package. The pay plan was approved by a 'special committee' of the Tesla board that included board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. It doesn't limit Musk's ability to start new businesses or continue with his political work.

[### Apple's new brain-controlled iPhone, iPad tech revealed in video (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/04/apples-new-brain-controlled-iphone-ipad-tech-revealed-in-video/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Synchron recently published a video of a patient controlling their iPad entirely with their thoughts. Apple is developing ways for Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) to translate brain signals into controls for its devices. The Synchron BCI is implanted in the brain's motor cortex using a minimally invasive endovascular procedure that involves inserting a catheter through the jugular vein. Synchron's device has been implanted in 10 people so far. The video of the patient controlling an iPad with their mind is available in the article.

[### Chinese AI Researchers Just Put a Monkey's Brain on a Computer (3 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/chinese-ai-researchers-just-put-a-monkeys-brain-on-a-computer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese researchers claim to have created an AI version of a monkey's brain. Project Darwin Monkey is the largest brain-like computer in the world, with 960 chips, each supporting over 2 billion spiking neurons and over 100 billion synapses, approaching the number of neurons in a macaque brain. Darwin Monkey uses DeepSeek's AI model for intelligent tasks such as logical reasoning, content generation, and mathematical problem solving. It has a custom operating system that uses concurrent scheduling of neuromorphic tasks and dynamic optimization of system resources for more efficiency.

[### The New DevEx Dilemma: Time Saved, Complexity Gained (Sponsor)](https://www.atlassian.com/teams/software-development/state-of-developer-experience-2025?utm_source=tldrnewsletter&amp;utm_medium=ad&amp;utm_campaign=stateofdevex)

[Atlassian's new State of DevEx report](https://www.atlassian.com/teams/software-development/state-of-developer-experience-2025?utm_source=tldrnewsletter&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=stateofdevex) shows that while developers are saving time with AI, they're also facing more organizational complexity than ever. We surveyed developers and managers to uncover what's really happening behind the hype. [Get the full breakdown](https://www.atlassian.com/teams/software-development/state-of-developer-experience-2025?utm_source=tldrnewsletter&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=stateofdevex) and learn how to improve DevEx in an AI-powered world.

[### The product design talent crisis (14 minute read)](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/product-design-talent-crisis/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The demand for senior product designers has skyrocketed in the past five years. This has left a troubling gap as there are fewer opportunities for designers to gain critical experience and mentorship to develop into the next generation of leaders. If the trend continues, the field of design risks becoming stagnant, overqualified, and obsolete. Other industries have proven that sustainable talent development is possible, but it requires deliberate structure and aligned incentives.

[### Estimates Are More Valuable Than You Think (2 minute read)](https://jola.dev/posts/estimates-are-more-valuable?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Good estimation is about creating trust and transparency. An estimate is the beginning of a conversation that surfaces hidden complexity before it becomes a problem. Estimates are valuable when they become a shared language between developers and stakeholders, as they become reference points for meaningful discussions about progress and priorities. Estimates create visibility into the work to be done, allowing managers to check in without being intrusive and creating realistic expectations. Teams that consistently deliver treat estimates as tools for collaboration rather than a source of stress. Adjusting an estimate based on new information isn't admitting defeat: it's being professional.

[### The Rise of Silicon Valley's Techno-Religion (15 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/technology/rationalists-ai-lighthaven.html?unlocked_article_code=1.b08.54my.K0GY-f9NcJ7H&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Lighthaven hotel has become a temple to the pursuit of artificial intelligence and the future of humanity. The gated complex includes five buildings and a small park. It is the de facto headquarters of the Rationalists, a group with many interests involving mathematics, genetics, and philosophy. One of the Rationalists' overriding beliefs is that artificial intelligence can deliver a better life if it doesn't destroy humanity first. The group believes it is up to the people building AI to ensure that it is a force for the greater good.

[### Longevity Firms Push Montana to Become Hub for Biohacking, Experimental Treatments (8 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/biotech/the-push-to-make-montana-a-hub-for-experimental-medical-treatments-716e1992?st=TQ8gSE&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Montana passed a law in 2023 that allows any patient to access experimental treatments, not just those with terminal illnesses. In May, the state's governor signed a bill to create a framework for licensed treatment centers to offer access to therapies that have passed a Phase 1 safety trial. Patients are unlikely to receive their first therapies under the law before 2026, but roughly 20 businesses, ranging from small biotech companies to medical clinic operators, have already reached out to express interest in operating in Montana under the new law. Healthcare providers and drug makers will be largely protected from legal liability if patients are harmed unless they are negligent or fail to get proper consent from patients.
