[### Real-time Linux is officially part of the kernel after decades of debate (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/real-time-linux-is-officially-part-of-the-kernel-after-decades-of-debate/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Real-time Linux, which enables high-end audio production and many other applications, has been available via out-of-tree patches since 2005. It has now been merged into the official Linux kernel, making it easier for developers to maintain real-time systems. Developers will no longer have to tend to out-of-tree patches when developing mission-critical systems. The update will likely have no impact on most desktop Linux users.

[### Patents for software and genetic code could be revived by two bills in Congress (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/software-and-genetic-patents-are-up-for-debate-again-in-congress/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider a pair of bills that would effectively nullify the Supreme Court's rulings against patents on broad software processes and human genes. Software and Internet advocates have taken notice and are taking steps to defend open source software against patent trolls. Regulators say the bills are necessary for a number of emerging sectors to prevent the stifling of innovation. Detractors say that the bills will be a huge gift to patent trolls, tech firms that aggressively license patents, and patent lawyers, but will be a loss for everyone else.

### Programming, Design & Data Science

[### The empire of C++ strikes back with Safe C++ blueprint (5 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/16/safe_c_plusplus/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Safe C++ Extensions proposal, recently published by the C++ community, aims to address the challenge of ensuring that C++ code is free of memory safety bugs. Private and public sector organizations have been pushing programmers to write new applications and rewrite old ones in memory safe languages over the past two years. The majority of serious vulnerabilities in large codebases come from memory safety flaws. The Safe C++ project adds new technology for ensuring memory safety, preventing users from writing unsafe code. It allows existing code to work as always and ensures stakeholders have control for incrementally opting into safety.

[### Paying down tech debt: further learnings (9 minute read)](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/paying-down-tech-debt-further-learnings/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Reducing tech debt can help developers get into 'the flow' - making small changes can lead to making more substantial changes. It is also a great way to learn a new codebase. Large-scale rewrites need heavyweight support, and a lot of commitment is required. They require everyone in the company to understand what needs to be done.

Once fought over by companies, tech talent is now competing for scarce positions. The reversal of fortunes signals a reset in an industry adjusting its labor needs. Job postings are down and industry layoffs have continued this year. Companies are shifting their strategies to focus on revenue-generating products and services, pulling back on entry-level hires, cutting recruiting teams, and shutting down projects and jobs that aren't huge moneymakers.
