[### TikTok begins restoring service for U.S. users after Trump comments (5 minute read)](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tiktok-says-restoring-service-us-users-rcna188320?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

TikTok is restoring service to US users after Trump posted to Truth Social calling for it to remain available so he can broadcast his inauguration. Trump said that he will issue an executive order to extend the period of time before the law banning the platform takes effect so that his administration can make a deal to protect US national security. There will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark. Some Republicans have made statements that appear to contradict Trump on how things might play out, saying that he will try to force a true divestiture of the social media platform.

Perplexity AI has submitted a bid to ByteDance to create a new merged entity that will combine Perplexity AI, TikTok US, and new capital partners. The new structure would allow for most of ByteDance's existing investors to retain their equity stakes. Any potential transaction between Perplexity AI and ByteDance will likely take months to complete. ByteDance has publicly implied that it will not sell TikTok US, but Perplexity AI believes that it might be interested in a merger.

There are rumors that a top AI company will be announcing Ph.D.-level super-agents in the coming week. OpenAI's Sam Altman has scheduled a closed-door briefing with US government officials on January 30. The developments may explain why top AI developers have been talking publicly about AI replacing mid-level software engineers and other human jobs this year. A super-agent breakthrough could turn generative AI into a true replacement for human workers. While the AI world is full of hype, sources say that the coming advancement is significant.

[### Balance of Power Shifts Back Toward Bosses (10 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/balance-of-power-shifts-back-toward-bosses-a2861df1?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While the job market looks as strong as ever, big companies are tightening remote-work policies, shrinking travel budgets, and cutting back on benefits. The balance of power between employers and employees has shifted as the labor market has gone from white-hot to merely solid. The power shift is evident across most of the labor market, but it is most prominent in white-collar roles. While the shift in leverage was displayed in layoffs and wage cuts in the past, it is now more subtle, often seen through changes to working conditions.
