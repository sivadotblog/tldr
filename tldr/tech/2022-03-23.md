[### Nvidia reveals enterprise H100 GPU for AI and teases ‚Äòworld‚Äôs fastest AI supercomputer‚Äô (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22989182/nvidia-ai-hopper-architecture-h100-gpu-eos-supercomputer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia has announced details about its new silicon architecture, the first data center GPU built using that architecture, and plans to build the world's fastest AI supercomputer. The new Hopper architecture is designed to accelerate the training of Transformer models on Nvidia's new H100 GPUs by six times compared to previous-generation chips. The H100 GPU contains 80 billion transistors and has a memory bandwidth of 3TB/s. It will allow models to be trained in days rather than weeks. Eos will be a supercomputer built using the Hopper architecture and offer 18.4 exaflops of AI performance.

[### First Microsoft, then Okta: New ransomware gang posts data from both (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/first-microsoft-then-okta-new-ransomware-gang-posts-data-from-both/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Lapsus$ group claims that it stole data from Microsoft and Okta, a Single-Sign-On provider. It posted images showing proprietary data on its Telegram channel to prove that it gained privileged access to both companies' systems. The group released a 37GB file archive containing source code for Bing, Bing Maps, and Cortana. Okta says that the impact of its data breach is limited, but Lapsus$ claims that it can reset passwords and multifactor authentication for most of Okta's clients.

[### Elon Musk announces Tesla is working on new manganese battery cell (2 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2022/03/22/elon-musk-tesla-working-new-manganese-battery-cell/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk announced during a speech to Tesla Gigafactory Berlin employees that the company is working on creating a manganese battery cell. Manganese will allow Tesla to create batteries with 50% more cell volume with the same amount of nickel. Tesla estimates that 300 terawatt-hours of battery cell production will be needed for the planet to fully transition into a sustainable world, so the batteries will need to be created out of common materials. A video of Musk's speech at Gigafactory Berlin is available in the article.

[### Scientists say they can read nearly the whole genome of an IVF-created embryo (3 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/article/scientists-say-they-can-read-nearly-whole-genome-ivf-created-embryo?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A Californian company claims that it can decode almost all of the DNA in days-old embryos created using in vitro fertilization. The technique requires fully sequencing both parents' DNA and reconstructing the embryo's genome with the help of the data. While the technique could be used to screen for genetic diseases, the science of screening embryos for genetic diseases is still new and primarily used only in research. There are still many limitations to the technology and scientists are still learning about what works.

[### Startup Says It‚Äôs Created an Actual ‚ÄúInvisibility Shield‚Äù (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/the-byte/startup-invisibility-shield?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Invisibility Shield Co, a British startup, claims to have created an invisibility shield that doesn't require power to operate. It is financing its invention through Kickstarter. A full-sized invisibility shield measures three by two feet and costs around $400. The technology works by reflecting light in a horizontal direction so that the subject behind the shield is almost completely obscured. A video from the startup showing the shield working in several environments is available.
