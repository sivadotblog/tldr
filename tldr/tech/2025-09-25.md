The MCP Registry makes it easy for LLMs to discover tools, but discovery alone isn't enough.

Tools still need to act on behalf of users, and that requires secure, delegated access. API keys don't cut it. They're hard to scope, break user flows, and undermine the promise of seamless integration.

[WorkOS Connect](https://workos.com/mcp?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q32025) delivers a fully compliant OAuth 2.1 flow. It handles PKCE, scopes, user consent, and secure token issuance out of the box.

The WorkOS advantage:- Compliant with MCP OAuth 2.1- Handles redirects, consent, and scopes- Easy to drop in and fast to ship

[### Huntington's disease successfully treated for first time (9 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevz13xkxpro?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Doctors have treated Huntington's disease successfully for the first time. A genetic disease, Huntington's relentlessly kills brain cells. It resembles a combination of dementia, Parkinson's, and motor neuron disease. The new treatment is a type of gene therapy given during 12 to 19 hours of delicate brain surgery. It will likely be very expensive, but it is considered safe. The data shows that, three years after surgery, there was an average 75% slowing of the disease.

[### How AWS S3 serves 1 petabyte per second on top of slow HDDs (14 minute read)](https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/how-aws-s3-scales-with-tens-of-millions-of-hard-drives?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AWS S3 is a scalable multi-tenant storage service with APIs to store and retrieve objects. It offers extremely high availability and durability at a relatively low cost. What started as a service optimized for backups and media storage for e-commerce websites has grown into the main storage system used for analytics and machine learning on massive data lakes. The growing trend now for entire data infrastructure projects to be based on S3, which gives them the benefit of stateless nodes while outsourcing difficult durability, replication, and load-balancing problems to S3 - this reduces cloud costs.

[### Hiring only senior engineers is killing companies (9 minute read)](https://workweave.dev/blog/hiring-only-senior-engineers-is-killing-companies?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There is currently a huge pool of exceptional junior engineers that most companies won't even consider. Smart companies can get a significant advantage by not fighting over seniors and hiring these juniors instead. Shopify recently hired 25 interns and is aiming for 1,000 more by the end of the year because interns bring energy, drive, and intensity, which pushes the whole team forward. While it is safer to hire someone with years of experience who can contribute from day one, the most critical factors - motivation, ambition, character, and brains - have little to do with experience.

While it would've been amazing to be an entrepreneur during the dot-com boom, right now is the best time to start something on the internet. There has never been a time to invent something.

[### Some loosely organized thoughts on the current Zeitgeist - Terence Tao (8 minute read)](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115259943398316677?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The systems, incentives, and technologies in the modern world have managed to slightly empower the individual while massively empowering large organizations, at the significant expense of small organizations. The imbalanced system provides significant material comforts and some limited feeling of agency, but it has led to individuals feeling disconnected, alienated, lonely, and cynical or pessimistic about the ability to influence future events or meet major challenges. Much of the current debate on societal issues is framed as conflicts between large organizations, conflicts between large organizations and average individuals, or a yearning for a return to a more traditional era.
