Large language models can write a lot of the tedious code you'll ever need to write and reduce the number of things you need to Google. While there are many objections to using the technology, it is undeniable that AI can speed up many workflows, even if it makes mistakes sometimes. Developers have always been responsible for what's in their code - AI doesn't change that. They still have to check code for mistakes and to understand how it all works.

[### Of Course Workers Want a Four-Day Week. Companies Should Too (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/workplace/of-course-workers-want-a-four-day-week-companies-should-too-0837a0a1?st=nmPfYi&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Studies across hundreds of businesses and nonprofits switching to four-day-week pilot programs show that working one day less every week with no reduction in pay results in reduced burnout, better mental health, and improvements in physical health. Organizations saw excellent results in performance metrics such as revenue, absenteeism, and resignations - less than 10% decided to discontinue the four-day week. Companies appear to be able to maintain 100% of their performance despite 20% less time at the workplace. The most common productivity hack used by companies was to cut down on meetings.
