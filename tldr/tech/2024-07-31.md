[### Make software simple again (5 minute read)](https://shiftmag.dev/dhh-make-software-simple-again-3829/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The software industry is more driven by profit and unnecessary complexity than by the ability to build and launch innovative products. Companies can save a lot of money by leaving the cloud. The old pricing model where users pay once for software rather than through monthly subscriptions can be very appealing to customers, but it makes it more difficult to scale a company if customers only pay once. A lower bar to entry for solo developers and small teams will allow more ideas to get the opportunity to prosper.

[### CrowdStrike's Impact on Aviation (7 minute read)](https://heavymeta.org/2024/07/28/crowdstrikes-impact-on-aviation.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An update to a sensor configuration by CrowdStrike on July 19 caused the largest IT outage in history. The outage affected many industries - this article looks at its impact on the US aviation industry. Delta was hit the hardest, followed by United, and to a significantly smaller degree, American. Southwest didn't appear to be affected by the outage at all. Delta took an extended time to recover and had to cancel thousands of flights in the days following the CrowdStrike update.

[### Amazon must recall dangerous products properly ‚Äî even ones sold by third-parties (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209953/amazon-notify-customers-recalled-items-cpsc?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has ruled that Amazon, not third-party sellers, is responsible for properly recalling hazardous items sold on its marketplace. Amazon failed to adequately notify the public about more than 400,000 recalled products sold between 2018 and 2021. The company downplayed the severity of hazards, telling customers about 'potential safety issues' rather than explicitly labeling recalls. Amazon now has a page dedicated to recalls that allows users to view product recalls and safety information for items they bought on Amazon.
