[### OpenAI experimental reasoning LLM has achieved a longstanding grand challenge in AI (4 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1946477742855532918.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An experimental reasoning model from OpenAI has achieved gold medal-level performance on the International Math Olympiad (IMO). IMO problems demand a new level of sustained creative thinking compared to past benchmarks. Submissions for the challenge are hard-to-verify, multi-page proofs. The experimental model solved five of the six problems on the 2025 IMO. OpenAI plans to release GPT-5 soon, but it won't be releasing anything with the experimental model's level of math capability for several months.

The war among some of the biggest companies on the planet for talent is playing out in an unprecedented frenzy of talent raids, secret deals, and betrayals. AI researchers whose minds have never been so highly valued are set to become as rich as NBA players and Hollywood stars. Some researchers are being offered pay packages worth more than $300 million, and even that kind of money isn't always enough to win them over. The social contract that once united founders and employees may be unraveling.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### A New Frontier in Fusion Technology (4 minute read)](https://www.marathonfusion.com/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Marathon Fusion has announced a solution to the transmutation of gold using a method that is massively scalable, pragmatically achievable, and economically irresistible. Its approach can generate 5,000 kilograms of gold per year per gigawatt of energy generation without compromise to fuel self-sufficiency or power output. It uses the neutrons that drive the multiplication reactions in deuterium-tritium fusion on mercury-198 to produce mercury-197, which decays in a few days to the only stable isotope of gold. The method could also be used to create other precious metals, radically transforming the economics of fusion and energy.

[### Cancer DNA is detectable in blood years before diagnosis (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-tumor-dna-blood-test-screening?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It is possible to spot tumor DNA more than three years before a cancer diagnosis. These telltale traces could be a powerful tool in early cancer screening efforts. The technology could help doctors detect cancers before any other signs or symptoms of the disease appear and dramatically change outcomes for patients.

[### Coding with LLMs in the summer of 2025 (an update) (6 minute read)](https://antirez.com/news/154?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Software developers can maximize their impact by using large language models (LLMs) in an explicit way while staying in the loop. This allows them to do things that are otherwise at the borders of their knowledge/expertise while learning in the process. It is wise to test out the capabilities of agents from time to time, as the technology will improve and eventually many coding tasks will be better served by AI alone. Those who avoid using LLMs due to ideological or psychological refusal will be at a disadvantage as they fail to develop the set of skills needed to work with the technology.

[### Rethinking CLI interfaces for AI (6 minute read)](https://www.notcheckmark.com/2025/07/rethinking-cli-interfaces-for-ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Every command-line interface (CLI) can be improved to provide extra context to large language models (LLMs). Doing this reduces tool calls and optimizes context windows. Agents may benefit from training on tools available within their agents. Developers may benefit from a whole set of AI-enhanced CLI tools or a custom LLM shell.

YouTube became the most-watched video provider on televisions in the US earlier this year. People now watch YouTube on TV sets more than on their phones or any other device. In response, creators are making longer, higher-quality videos that appeal to families and groups of friends watching in their living rooms. This article looks at the history of the platform and the secrets to its success.

[### Why Banks Are on High Alert About Stablecoins (5 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazons-aws-cloud-computing-unit-cuts-least-hundreds-jobs-sources-say-2025-07-17/?utm_source=tldrnewsletterhttps://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/why-banks-are-on-high-alert-about-stablecoins-2f308aa0?st=eDDGyS&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The House recently voted to pass a bill that spells out some ground rules for stablecoins. Stablecoins have the potential to lure away customer deposits from banks. The Genius Act creates a regulatory framework where stablecoins are supposed to maintain a 1:1 ratio with the US dollar or other fiat currencies so that they can easily be used for payments. This could make stablecoins more attractive to use, especially for cross-border payments, which can take days to settle and are subject to interchange and other fees.
