[### The race to reinvent the space station (13 minute read)](https://archive.ph/zj1uu?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NASA is funding a competition for privately owned replacements for the ISS when it is decommissioned. The winners of the competition, to be selected around 2025, could expect an estimated $1 billion in annual revenue to deliver space station services. The contenders are hoping to become the go-to platform for the rapidly emerging space economy. A commercial space station would have more capabilities than the ISS, which is a research lab. Transitioning to commercial platforms would free up a significant portion of NASA's budget.
