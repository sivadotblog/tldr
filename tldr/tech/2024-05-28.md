Don't try to refactor an entire codebase all at once - pick achievable goals.

[### What are you getting paid in? (5 minute read)](https://www.approachwithalacrity.com/what-are-you-getting-paid-in/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

You can't always pay and motivate people with just money. You can pay people in lots of currencies: quality of life, prestige, status, impact, influence - just to name a few. People value different things and want to be paid in different ways. By thinking creatively, you can pay people in ways other than money. The best way to make sure you get paid the way you want to is to pick the right industry. It's easier to accumulate what you want through time and work than to try and convert between currencies.
