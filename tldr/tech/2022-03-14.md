[### New MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro with M2 coming later this year (3 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/10/exclusive-new-macbook-air-and-13-inch-macbook-pro-with-m2-coming-later-this-year/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

New MacBooks with the M2 chip are coming later this year. The next-generation MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro are expected to have M2 versions. The M2 will feature a powerful 10-core GPU and replace the current entry-level M1. It will likely not be better than the high-end M1 Pro, M1 Max, and M1 Ultra processors. There are no set release dates yet for the machines, but they will likely be introduced in June at WWDC and released later in the year.

[### Moderna Will Develop mRNA Vaccines for 15 of the World‚Äôs Worst Diseases (3 minute read)](https://singularityhub.com/2022/03/10/moderna-to-develop-mrna-vaccines-for-15-diseases-that-threaten-global-health/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Moderna has announced plans to develop mRNA vaccines against 15 different pathogens. mRNA vaccines are essentially plug and play, so scientists can add in codes specific to the virus they hope to protect against without having to develop and manufacture an entirely new formula. They are also easy to scale in production at a relatively low cost, making it possible to screen multiple vaccine candidates with low resources. Moderna will prioritize viruses classified as persistent global health threats. It aims to have all 15 vaccines in clinical trials by 2025.

[### Programmable Blocks Tease Self-Assembling Space Structures (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/self-configurable-electrovoxel?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have developed modular robotic cubes that use embedded electromagnets to move called ElectroVoxels. The cubes have wires embedded into their edges and can attract or repel each other depending on their configuration. They can be programmed and easily and cheaply manufactured. The ElectroVoxels could be used effectively in space as reconfigurable robots or to help build temporary structures. Pictures of the ElectroVoxels are available in the article.
