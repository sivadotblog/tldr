The LAN was a magical place to learn about computers. You could do things that would be unthinkable on today‚Äôs internet: permission-less file sharing, experimental servers with no security, shared software where one machine could easily bring down the network.

In this [classic blog post by Tailscale Co-founder David Crawshaw](https://tailscale.com/blog/remembering-the-lan/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2022-09-09&utm_content=remembering-the-lan), he recalls the childhood magic of the local area network ‚Äî including his non-programmer father building business software for 486 computers, and why the same would be much harder to do today.

Can we have a 90‚Äôs LAN-like experience again, along with the best parts of the 21st century internet? [Tailscale thinks we can.](/13de9a525fb9453eb72fa285bd85aa3c)
