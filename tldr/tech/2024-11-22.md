[### Apple Working on 'LLM Siri' for 2026 Launch (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/21/apple-llm-siri-2026/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is working on a smarter version of Siri that employees are calling 'LLM Siri'. It will be able to hold ongoing conversations like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Using large language models will allow Siri to perform much more complex tasks. The new Siri could be announced as part of the June Worldwide Developers Conference in 2025. Apple is aiming for a spring 2026 launch date.

[### Welcome to Google's nightmare: US reveals plan to destroy search monopoly (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/welcome-to-googles-nightmare-us-reveals-plan-to-destroy-search-monopoly/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US Department of Justice has filed its proposed final judgment in the antitrust case against Google. The plans require Google to sell its Chrome browser and retains the option of forcing Google to divest Android if competition doesn't increase from behavioral remedies. They include bans on exclusive default deals with other browsers and device makers and prohibit Google from building new browsers. Google may have to fund an education campaign showing people how to switch search engines. The company will have plenty of time to argue against the proposal as the final revisions are not due until March next year.

[### The key moment came 38 minutes after Starship roared off the launch pad (11 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/the-key-moment-came-38-minutes-after-starship-roared-off-the-launch-pad/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The only hiccup during SpaceX's sixth Starship test was an abortive attempt to catch the rocket's Super Heavy booster back on the launch site. SpaceX demonstrated that Starship can safely deorbit itself on future missions by reigniting one of its six Raptor engines for a brief burn to slightly adjust its flight path about 38 minutes after liftoff. The achievement means that Starship will likely soon be cleared to travel into orbit, deploy Starlink internet satellites, and conduct in-space refueling experiments. There will be plenty more opportunities for booster catches in the coming months as SpaceX plans to ramp up its launch cadence at Starbase.

Neuralink has secured Health Canada's approval to launch human trials in the country. The company is now actively looking for potential participants. Neuralink's implant allows patients to control devices with their brains without the need for wires or any kind of physical movement. The company is specifically looking for patients who have limited or no ability in both hands due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for its trials in Canada.

[### ~9.5% of software engineers do virtually nothing (4 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1859290734257635439.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Ghost engineers have less than 0.1x the performance of the median engineer and do virtually no work. Around 14% of software engineers working remotely do almost no work, compared to 9% in hybrid roles and 6% in the office. While on average, engineers working from the office perform better, 5x engineers are more common in remote work. Ghost engineers unfairly burden teams, waste company resources, block jobs for others, and limit humanity's progress. Removing them from organizations would save companies large amounts in pay with no decrease in performance.

The US Justice Department has proposed that Google unwind its partnership with AI startup Anthropic as part of a resolution for the landmark antitrust case over online search. Google may be barred from acquiring, investing in, or collaborating with any company that controls where consumers search for information. Google says that the remedy would chill the company's investment in artificial intelligence and jeopardize the US' global economic and technology leadership at a time when it's needed most. Anthropic's deal with Amazon is also under scrutiny.
