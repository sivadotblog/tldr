### Big Tech & Startups

[### Google.com tests a news-filled homepage, just like Bing and Yahoo (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/google-com-tests-a-news-filled-homepage-just-like-bing-and-yahoo/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google's latest experiment has its homepage filled with rows of news articles. The experiment is currently being run in India and might not ever see a wide launch. Even if it does launch, it could be an optional setting or alternative mode, with the traditional white page still available as an option. Google used to have a feature that allowed users to customize their home pages with various news, weather, and stock widgets.

[### Apple’s cheaper Vision Pro follow-up still won’t be cheap (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/15/23917710/apple-vision-pro-cheaper-no-eyesight-external-display?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is apparently aiming for a price point between $1,500 and $2,500 for its more affordable follow-up to the Apple Vision Pro. The cheaper version will likely ditch the external display and run on an iPhone-grade chip, have fewer cameras, and get lower-resolution screens inside. Apple has reportedly shifted people away from its technically-challenging AR glasses project to prioritize the development of the friendlier-priced version of the headset.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### NASA just launched the Psyche mission—no one knows what it will find (14 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/10/nasa-is-about-to-launch-a-mission-of-pure-discovery-to-a-metal-asteroid/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Psyche is an asteroid 2.2 billion miles away that is likely the exposed core of a failed planet. If all goes well, the Psyche spacecraft will settle in an orbit around the asteroid in 2029. Scientists are quite confident that the asteroid is largely made of metal. The Psyche mission's findings will have important implications for asteroid mining.

[### Why We Don’t Ship Software as Fast as We Used To (9 minute read)](https://every.to/p/why-we-don-t-ship-software-as-fast-as-we-used-to?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Software development used to be much faster. However, software is not as simple as it used to be. A lot of the complexity in today's software is invisible. This complexity is required just to meet today's baseline expectations. Slower development isn't necessarily worse - it's just what happens when projects get bigger and more people are involved.

[### Startup Aims to Build Hundreds of Chip Factories with Prefab Parts and AI (3 minute read)](https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/23/10/14/0536251/startup-aims-to-build-hundreds-of-chip-factories-with-prefab-parts-and-ai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nanotronics is a New York-based industrial AI company that wants to build an AI-enabled chip factory that can be assembled and expanded modularly with prefab pieces. Its Cubefabs system uses AI to take away the need for the specialization normally needed in a lab and allow people who are not semiconductor experts to work at the facilities. Each facility will need only about 30 people to operate. The bulk of each facility can be flat-packed and put in a shipping container.
