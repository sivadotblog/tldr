The introduction of the H2-A rocket in 2001 allowed Japan to tap into the commercial launch market. Manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the medium-lift rocket has seen some success, including the launch of the Emirates Mars Mission in 2020. However, its high cost of $90 million per launch, 50% more than SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, has prevented it from breaking through the commercial launch market. Japan's new H3 rocket is set to take off for the first time at 1:37 UTC on February 17. It was developed to have a cost of $51 million per launch in its base configuration.

A new genetic disease has been described for the first time in three children who share neurodevelopmental issues. This disease is linked to mutations in both copies of a gene called ATG4D, which is responsible for recycling damaged or defective cells in the brain. It is not well understood how ATG4D contributes to this recycling process. Further research could provide insight into more common brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's, which are thought to occur due to a breakdown in the brain's maintenance.
