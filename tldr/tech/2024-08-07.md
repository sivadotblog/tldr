Greg Brockman, another co-founder of OpenAI and its president, announced on Monday that he was taking a sabbatical for the rest of the year.

There are two serious efforts underway in China to develop a rival to SpaceX's Starlink project. The first batch of 18 satellites for one of those projects launched into low-Earth orbit on Tuesday on a Long March 4A rocket.

The full deployment of these networks will require a significant increase in China's launch capacity.

[### OpenAI: Introducing Structured Outputs in the API (5 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/6/openai-structured-outputs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has introduced two new ways to guarantee valid inputs. The first is a new 'strict' option for function definitions and the second is a new feature option for the 'response\_format' field that lets users pass a JSON schema to specify a required output. OpenAI's models will now return a 'refusal' message if a model denies a request. The new gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model is 50% cheaper on inputs and 33% on outputs compared to gpt-4o-2024-05-13. It also supports up to 16,384 tokens, up from 4,096.

[### Predictions for the future of software engineering (2 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1820460524460802256.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Software engineering will likely look radically different in a few years. The introduction of coding agents that complete tasks end-to-end will change how engineers work, making them more like engineering managers who spend more time on the higher level parts of coding. This will have many effects, like creating more software, more engineers, and productivity gains for companies. Marketing may even start being directed to AI agents as companies try to get them to choose their products over a rival's.

A recent survey on employee satisfaction found that those who are allowed to choose between in-person, remote, or hybrid work are three times more likely to want to stay at their company. It also found that workers facing return-to-office mandates are 14 times less likely to 'quit and stay'. Several other studies have found similar results.
