[### OpenAI reportedly in talks to close a new funding round at $100B+ valuation (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/openai-reportedly-in-talks-to-close-new-funding-round-at-100b-valuation/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise funds at a valuation of more than $100 billion, substantially higher than the company's previous $86 billion valuation. Investors include Thrive Capital and Microsoft. The financing will be OpenAI's biggest outside infusion of capital since Microsoft invested nearly $10 billion in January last year. While OpenAI's revenue eclipsed $3.4 billion early this year, the company is on track to lose nearly $5 billion by year end. It has already burned through $8.5 billion on AI training and staffing.

Workers have been making last-minute upgrades to SpaceX's Starship launch pad in South Texas pretty much every day for the last couple of weeks. If all goes well on the Starship's next test flight, the launch pad's mechanical arms will close together to capture the Super Heavy booster as it descends back to Earth. SpaceX announced that Starship and Super Heavy were ready to fly, pending regulatory approval, on August 8. The FAA is still evaluating SpaceX's proposed flight profile. It is unclear how long approval will take, but the state of the launch pad suggests that the next test is still at least a couple of weeks away.

[### Programming With ChatGPT (4 minute read)](https://henrikwarne.com/2024/08/25/programming-with-chatgpt/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Using ChatGPT to code can be a real productivity boost. Instead of reading examples on Stack Overflow and adapting them to their particular case, developers can instantly get code tailored to their specific needs. It can make developers more efficient, but they need to remember that it is still a tool. It is important to always test the code it provides to quickly discover any hallucinations.

[### State and time are the same thing (5 minute read)](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/state-and-time-are-the-same-thing/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

State is time and time is state. The only way to see the passage of time is by measuring changes in observable state. Changes in state matter in that they create new times. If a state update is purely internal and cannot affect the observable state, then it doesn't advance time. This model can be used to reason about abstract systems.
