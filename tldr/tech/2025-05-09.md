[### Meta Reportedly Eyeing 'Super Sensing' Tech for Smart Glasses (2 minute read)](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/meta-reportedly-eyeing-super-sensing-tech-for-smart-glasses/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta is working on a 'super sensing' type of facial recognition technology for its smart glasses lineup. The software will be able to recognize people by name and keep a better track of what users are doing throughout the day. It will be opt-in only. The company is reportedly working on two new pairs of smart glasses and also re-evaluating its privacy policies and potential safety risks associated with the technology.

[### Aurora to add night driving, new routes as it ramps driverless trucking (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/08/aurora-to-add-night-driving-new-routes-as-it-ramps-driverless-trucking/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Aurora Innovation plans to expand its driverless trucking route beyond Dallas to Houston and into El Paso and Phoenix. The company plans to start sending its self-driving trucks out at night and during adverse weather conditions in the second half of 2025. It already runs freight with self-driving trucks in those conditions, but with a human safety operator behind the wheel. Running at nighttime would double the company's drive time and is a key milestone.

The saola is a bovine that hangs out in the mountainous forests of Vietnam and Laos. The species wasn't scientifically described until 1993 and has still never been seen in person by scientists or studied in the wild. It is a critically endangered species with an estimated population ranging from 50 to up to a few hundred individuals. An international team of scientists has reconstructed the saola genome, hinting at some potential good news for the chances of its conservation. The saola are split into two populations with considerable genetic differences, which means there may be enough genetic diversity to start working on building a captive breeding program.

[### Ask HN: How much better are AI IDEs vs. copy pasting into chat apps? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43922759&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Copying and pasting into chat apps can be tedious, but assistants like Copilot aren't as smart as the 'thinking' chat apps. This makes it clear why AI IDEs exist, but using them can get expensive because of the pay-per-use pricing as opposed to effectively unlimited prompts for a monthly subscription as with thinking apps. This Hacker News thread contains a discussion on the current state of AI IDEs and how they compare to chat apps. The thread mentions lesser known alternatives to Cursor and Windsurf, such as Roo code and aider-chat, that unlock different workflows.

Many of the foundation's beneficiaries have been people in low-income countries with endemic and frequently deadly diseases.

[### Ask HN: What are good high-information density UIs (screenshots, apps, sites)? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43925732&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It can be difficult to find examples of good high information density UIs. This Hacker News thread lists resources for finding these examples and tips for how to find good examples. One of these methods is to look at programs used by pro creatives - some people regularly spend their days using a single such product as their primary work tool. Another source of good examples of dense information communication can be found in command line system monitoring tools.
