Anthropic's founders left OpenAI to create a new firm because they wanted to build a safety-first company from the ground up. The company is currently building a system that is purposely deceptive to see what kind of techniques can prevent malicious behaviors. The goal is to create an AI that continues to lie even when standard reinforcement learning with human feedback is used. Anthropic plans to cede control of its corporate board to a team of experts whose financial benefit from the company will be limited to help keep the company ethical.

A company based in Massachusetts has developed a technique to edit pigs' genomes so that their organs can be transplanted into other species. The gene-edited pig hearts have so far been transplanted into two infant baboons. Neither of the animals survived beyond a few days.

Its goal is to be able to transplant pig hearts into babies born with heart conditions in order to buy the infants more time to wait for a human heart.

[### WebGPU ‚Äî All of the cores, none of the canvas (34 minute read)](https://surma.dev/things/webgpu/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

WebGPU is an API that gives developers low-level, general-purpose access to GPUs. This blog post aims to make WebGPU accessible for web developers. It doesn't focus on using WebGPU to generate graphics, but instead uses the API to access the raw computing power a GPU provides. The post was written by someone learning WebGPU, so while it can teach readers how to use the API effectively, the techniques described within may not be the most efficient.
