[### Google goes ‚Äúopen AI‚Äù with Gemma, a free, open-weights chatbot family (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-goes-open-ai-with-gemma-a-free-open-weights-chatbot-family/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google's new family of AI language models, Gemma, are free open-weights models built on technology similar to Gemini. Gemma models can run locally on a desktop or laptop computer. There are two models, one with 2 billion parameters and the other with 7 billion. Each model has pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants available. Google claims the 7 billion parameter model outperforms Meta's Llama 2 7B and 13B models on several benchmarks in math, Python code generation, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning tasks. This is Google's first significant open large language model release since OpenAI's ChatGPT was revealed in late 2022.

[### 75K loyal Redditors can snag shares before Reddit goes public (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/report-75k-loyal-redditors-can-snag-shares-before-reddit-goes-public/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Reddit hopes to entice its users to become shareholders to help drive change and make the market more fair to individual traders. 75,000 of the most prolific Redditors will have the opportunity to buy shares before trading starts when the company goes public later this year, possibly as soon as March. The privilege is usually reserved for big investors. Reddit announced its IPO in December 2021, when it was valued at about $10 billion. The site experienced widespread protests in June last year after it killed off many third-party apps by charging for access to its API. Users are still questioning the company's leadership over the decision.

Flying to the Moon is expensive, so NASA decided to reach out to private companies for help. NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program originally aimed to launch its first missions by 2020. Years later, the first vehicles are now ready. Astrobotic's Odysseus lander will attempt to land on the Moon on Thursday. No private company has successfully landed on the Moon yet. If the CLPS program is successful, in a few years, NASA will have laid the foundation for a highway to the Moon.

Gemini Pro 1.5 is an enormous upgrade for the Gemini series. The model has a 1,000,000 token context size, much larger than Claude 2.1's 200,000 and gpt-4-turbo's 128,000 token context sizes.
