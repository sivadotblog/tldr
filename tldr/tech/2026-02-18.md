[### Apple Ramps Up Work on Glasses, Pendant, and Camera AirPods for AI Era (9 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-17/apple-ramps-up-work-on-glasses-pendant-and-camera-airpods-for-ai-era?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTM4OTY0MiwiZXhwIjoxNzcxOTk0NDQyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQURBNUtLSVVQVUwwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.0DiNviXF74PIzSHZU7uvzpo5pF0ymAz6td8_gh6JQQE&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is accelerating development on smart glasses, a pendant that can be pinned to a shirt or worn as a necklace, and AirPods with expanded AI capabilities. All three devices are being built around the Siri digital assistant. They will rely on visual context to carry out actions. Apple is also developing a range of AI devices for the home, including a smart display built, an updated HomePod speaker, and a compact indoor sensor for home security and automation.

[### Tesla Begins Cybercab Production. Now Comes The Hard Part (4 minute read)](https://insideevs.com/news/787560/tesla-cybercab-robotaxi-giga-texas-production/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla's first purpose-built driverless vehicle has rolled off the Gigafactory Texas production line. The CyberCab is a two-seater coupe that comes without a steering wheel or pedals, fully relying on the company's Full-Self Driving software for control. Robotaxis are central to Tesla's plans and could unlock trillions of dollars in value. The CyberCab uses a production technique that is extremely hard, so the early production rate is expected to be 'agonizingly slow', but it will eventually scale up to produce up to five million robotaxis a year.

[### Souped-Up CRISPR Gene Editor Replicates and Spreads Like a Virus (6 minute read)](https://singularityhub.com/2026/02/17/souped-up-crispr-gene-editor-replicates-and-spreads-like-a-virus/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team at the University of California Berkeley and collaborators have modified CRISPR-Cas9 to replicate and spread to other cells. The scientists added genetic instructions for cells to make a virus-like transporter that can encapsulate the CRISPR machinery, and once manufactured in treated cells, the CRISPR cargo ships to neighboring cells. The upgraded editor is roughly three times more effective at gene editing lab-grown cells compared to standard CRISPR. It increases the safety profile of gene-editing treatments and potentially expands the technology to tissues and organs that are more challenging to genetically alter than the liver.

[### The Sweet Lesson of Neuroscience (28 minute read)](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/13/the-sweet-lesson-of-neuroscience?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The implications of understanding the brain's steering circuits go beyond AI. Many psychiatric conditions can be seen as failures of internal teaching. Answering how sophisticated, within-lifetime teaching actually works inside mammalian brains could link psychiatry, developmental neuroscience, and new ideas for AI alignment into a research program. Brains are architectures of internal teachers. We should try to find these teachers and learn from them.

[### Coding Agents in Feb 2026 (13 minute read)](https://calv.info/agents-feb-2026?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Different coding agents are good at different tasks - the best way to decide which to use is to choose based on time and whether it needs to run autonomously or collaboratively. Model performance and speed is governed both by the pure performance of the model and also how well it can manage multiple context windows and delegate to sub-agents or teams of agents. This article discusses several coding agents and how best to use each of them. Ideas, architecture, and project sequencing are becoming the limiting factors for building great products.

Vertical AI is a fertile ground for moats. These products share operational knowledge packaged as services. Customers stay because of their own experience of relying on the product under stress. Trust leads the customer to bring harder problems, harder problems generate deeper operational knowledge, and this deeper knowledge earns more trust. Any newcomer trying to enter the market starts at the bottom.

[### Warner Bros. rejects Paramount again but asks for “best and final offer” (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/warner-bros-gives-paramount-one-more-week-to-beat-netflix-merger-offer/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Warner Bros. Discovery is giving Paramount one more week to make its best and final offer despite officially still being committed to Netflix. The company has recommended shareholders vote for the Netflix merger. Netflix has provided Warner Bros. with a limited waiver that permits Warner Bros. to engage in discussions with Paramount until February 23. Netflix is set to pay $27.75 per share for an acquisition that includes HBO Max, WB Studios, and other assets. Paramount has offered $31 per share, but it wants to buy the entire company.
