[### AI protein-prediction tool AlphaFold3 is now open source (5 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03708-4?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The software code for Google DeepMind's AlphaFold3 is now publicly available for free for non-commercial applications. AlphaFold3 is capable of modeling proteins and other molecules. It was originally published without code or model weights, which drew criticism from scientists who said the move undermined reproducibility. Several other companies have also released open-source protein structure prediction tools based on AlphaFold3's specifications.

[### LG has a stretchable display that can expand by 50 percent (2 minute read)](https://mashable.com/article/lg-stretchable-display?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

LG has unveiled a stretchable display that can expand up to 50% and freely transform into any shape. The display uses tiny micro-LED light sources and has a 100-pixel-per-inch resolution. It can be stretched more than 10,000 times. The technology, which opens up the possibility for entirely new types of interfaces, could be widely applied in industries such as fashion, wearables, and mobility. Pictures and a video of the display being stretched are available in the article.

[### SpaceX Dragon gives ISS a helping hand with altitude (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/11/spacex_dragon_iss_boost/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX's Dragon reboosted the International Space Station (ISS) with a 12-minute, 30-second burn of the freighter's Draco thrusters. The burn adjusted the orbit of the ISS, proving that SpaceX's Dragon can be used in the same way as the Roscosmos Progress spacecraft and Northrop Grumman's Cygnus. The ISS requires regular reboosts to prevent it from tumbling back to Earth. It is expected to be retired in 2030, but there is a possibility the station's life will be extended a few more years.

[### Scientists make mind-blowing breakthrough in battery safety with prototype that actually works when cut: 'The battery continues to function' (3 minute read)](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/scientists-mind-blowing-breakthrough-battery-104558429.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese battery researchers have developed two lithium-sulfur batteries, one that remains stable after 300 charge/discharge cycles and another that provides power after being cut in half or folded. The batteries' resilience is due to a unique cathode coating. Lithium-sulfur batteries have the potential to be cheaper than lithium-ion alternatives, but they can take hours to charge. The breakthrough could lead to safer batteries and make lithium-sulfur technology more mainstream.

[### All the data can be yours (5 minute read)](https://jero.zone/posts/reverse-engineering-apis?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article presents tips for finding and using undocumented APIs. GitHub's code search tool is a powerful way to look for potential endpoints. Parts of pages that load after the rest of the page or actions that don't cause a full page refresh are likely making requests to JSON APIs. All WordPress sites have a built-in REST API for accessing posts, pages, media, and more. Other tips include looking at the site's robots.txt file, searching Google, reading and debugging JavaScript, and looking through the site's mobile app.
