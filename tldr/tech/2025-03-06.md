### Big Tech & Startups

[### You knew it was coming: Google begins testing AI-only search results (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/google-is-expanding-ai-overviews-and-testing-ai-only-search-results/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google may soon just tell users what's on the Internet instead of showing them. The company is expanding its AI search features and testing a more substantial change in the form of AI Mode - a version of Google that will only show AI results. Google insists that helping people discover content online remains central to its approach, but AI Mode won't show organic results - it is designed to operate in a conversational way, so users will have to refine their search or ask follow-up questions. The experimental feature is only available for Google One AI Premium subscribers.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Advanced Robotic Surgeries are Minimally Invasive, Helping Patients Heal Faster (5 minute read)](https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/advanced-robotic-surgeries-are-minimally-invasive-helping-patients-heal?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Robot surgeries account for around 22% of surgeries nowadays. The method offers less bleeding, less time in the hospital, and faster recovery time with less pain. These robots are machines operated by highly trained and experienced surgeons that remotely operate arms that hold tiny surgical instruments. Using robots allows surgeons to comfortably maneuver in places that are otherwise quite restrictive. The technology is not only becoming more widespread, it is also becoming more advanced - it may be possible one day to have robots operating independently.

[### Yes, we are about to be treated to a second lunar landing in a week (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/after-skidding-into-the-moon-intuitive-machines-hopes-to-stick-second-landing/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It was 18,700 days, or 51 years, between the time when the Apollo 17 mission landed on the Moon and when Intuitive Machines' Nova-C Odysseus lander did on February 22, 2024. While Intuitive Machines' lander top toppled over, it still completed most of its scientific experiments. Firefly's Blue Ghost stuck its landing last weekend, making it two landings in slightly more than a year. Intuitive Machines plans to send a second Nova-C lander, Athena, to the Moon this afternoon - if successful, that would be three US landers in 377 days.

[### Business observability: metrics, use cases, and best practices (Sponsor)](https://www.datadoghq.com/resources/business-observability-best-practices-ebook/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=dg-coreplatform-ww-business-of-observability-tldr)

Telemetry can tell you more than technical performance.

[### Aider: Using uv as an installer (3 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/6/aider-using-uv-as-an-installer/#atom-everything?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Aider CLI Python utility uses an innovative solution to help end users install it in an isolated virtual environment without first needing to teach them what an 'isolated virtual environment' is. It uses the uv Rust binary to install aider-chat, which in turn installs a brand-new standalone copy of Python 3.12 and puts it into uv's own managed directory structure where it shouldn't hurt anything else. There's more to it, and more advanced users may opt for an alternative installation mechanism, but the pattern is a very tasteful way of getting everything working for non-expert Python users with minimal risk of breaking their systems.

[### A Student Used AI to Beat Amazon's Brutal Technical Interview. He Got an Offer and Someone Tattled to His University (6 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/a-student-used-ai-to-beat-amazons-brutal-technical-interview-he-got-an-offer-and-someone-tattled-to-his-university-2000571562?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Columbia University student Roy Lee managed to land internships at Amazon, Meta, and TikTok using a simple AI program. He had originally planned to get a degree to work in Big Tech, but training for technical interviews killed his passion for the job, which led him to create the program. Columbia University has scheduled a disciplinary hearing for Lee's stunt, but he will not be attending - Lee plans to leave the university, saying that the program he built is proof that the jobs Big Tech are offering are becoming obsolete.
