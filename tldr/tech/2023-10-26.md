Google co-founder Sergey Brin‚Äôs 124-meter-long airship Pathfinder 1 is set to launch for the first time in the days or weeks ahead.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### First malaria vaccine slashes early childhood mortality (7 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/article/first-malaria-vaccine-slashes-early-childhood-deaths?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The first vaccine approved to fight malaria cut deaths among young children by 13% over nearly 4 years. It reduced severe malaria by 22% in kids younger than enough to receive a three-shot series. The 13% drop in deaths translates to tens of thousands of lives saved every year. The mortality benefit was documented even in areas with the lowest coverage. The vaccine may be training the immune system in a general way that extends a protective benefit against other infections.

[### Low-calorie sugar breakthrough could make allulose a household name (6 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/science/breakthrough-low-calorie-sugar-production/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Allulose is a sugar substitute that is around 70% as sweet as sucrose but contains just 10% of the calories. It has been shown to improve blood glucose levels and help in weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. The compound was previously difficult to produce. Scientists at the University of California, Davis, have made a breakthrough and developed a manufacturing technique that offers both a high-quality yield and viable sustainability. The technique uses modified E. coli in a process that is already established industrially.

[### Confessions of a Middle-Class Founder (17 minute read)](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/venture-capital-backed-startup-founder-confessions.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Every founder either wants to be rich, with their wealth in service of some end, or they want to be king, with the money as a mere byproduct of trying to make the world the way they want it to be. Venture capitals are looking for startups with the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue per year. Most winners win big because most startups fail. The industry looks down on bootstrapped companies without scale potential and this prevents some startups from exiting.
