[### Fitbit Ace LTE: Hands On With Google's First Smartwatch for Kids (4 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/fitbit-ace-lte-hands-on-with-googles-first-smartwatch-for-kids?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Fitbit Ace LTE, designed for kids between the ages of 7 and 11, focuses on gaming and safety. At $229, the smartwatch can track a child's activity as they play throughout the day. With 16 hours of battery life, the Ace LTE is resistant to drops and can be submerged in up to 164 feet of water. It is available now for preorder and will be in stores on June 5.

[### Apple's AI plans involves 'black box' for cloud data (3 minute read)](https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/05/29/apples-ai-plans-involves-black-box-for-cloud-data?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is expected to announce AI implementations into iOS 18 and its other operating systems at WWDC. The company intends to process data from AI applications inside a virtual black box that will use only Apple's hardware to perform AI processing in the cloud. The approach will prevent both Apple and potential hackers from being able to see app data. Using a cloud approach allows Apple to reduce the hardware requirements of its products.

[### Neuralink wants 3 more quadriplegic patients for its brain control interface trial (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/29/neuralink_to_add_more_subjects_to_trial/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Neuralink is recruiting another three subjects for its brain implant study. It is seeking subjects aged 22 to 75 with severe quadriplegia due to spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for at least one year without improvement. Healthy people, people with morbid obesity, or people with an active device already implanted are disqualified from the study. Participants will be monitored for adverse events for 72 months following the implantation procedure.

[### New BYD Hybrid Can Drive Non-Stop for More Than 2,000 Kilometers (3 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-28/byd-shows-off-new-hybrid-powertrain-capable-of-ultra-long-drive?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

BYD has unveiled a new hybrid powertrain that can travel for more than 2,000 kilometers without recharging or refueling. Vehicles with the technology can travel from New York to Miami on a single charge and a full tank of gas. The upgraded tech will be launched in the Qin L and the Seal 06. Both mid-sized sedans, which were unveiled at the Beijing Auto Show in April, cost under $13,800.

[### Three Laws of Software Complexity (or: why software engineers are always grumpy) (3 minute read)](https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/blog/2024/05/08/2024-ThreeLaws.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Software engineers are destined to wallow in unnecessary complexity due to three fundamental laws: a well-designed system will degrade into a badly designed system over time, complexity is a moat filled by leaky abstractions, and there is no fundamental upper limit on software complexity. Building a new system from scratch without succumbing to these laws is a lot harder than it sounds. Engineers who work on badly designed systems suffer more as badly designed systems have unbound complexity.

[### What We Learned from a Year of Building with LLMs (Part I) (45 minute read)](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-we-learned-from-a-year-of-building-with-llms-part-i/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While the barrier to entry for building AI products has lowered, creating something effective beyond a demo remains a deceptively difficult endeavor. This series of articles identifies crucial lessons and methodologies for developing products based on large language models gathered by people who have been building real-world applications on top of ML systems over the past year. It is organized into three sections: tactical, operational, and strategic. This first part dives into the tactical nuts and bolts of working with large language models and shares best practices and common pitfalls around prompting, setting up retrieval-augmented generation, applying flow engineering, and evaluation and monitoring.

[### A myopia epidemic is sweeping the globe. Here's how to stop it (17 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01518-2?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Studies from around the world are finding an increased rate of incidences of pathologically stretched eyeballs among children compared with pre-pandemic levels. The pandemic saw real-life classrooms and playgrounds give way to virtual meetings and digital devices, increasing the time that children spend focusing on screens and other nearby objects significantly. This shift has caused their eyeballs to lengthen to accommodate short-vision tasks. An hour of extra outdoor break time every day can markedly reduce the incidence of short-sightedness.

[### How A.I. Made Mark Zuckerberg Popular Again in Silicon Valley (10 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/technology/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai.html?unlocked_article_code=1.v00.I5bE.rjls9rsaGWKF&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

When Meta released its AI, it made the technology freely available, largely the opposite of what Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft have done. Mark Zuckerberg has become the highest-profile technology executive to support and promote the open-source model for AI. While other companies are using a closed strategy to guard their technology, Zuckerberg believes that the technology is so important and the opportunities are so great that it should be made widely available so that everyone can benefit. The decision to open source Meta's AI tech was well-received and made Zuckerberg a lot more popular in tech circles.
