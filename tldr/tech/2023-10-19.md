The first deliveries of the Cybertruck will take place during an event on November 30 at the Gigafactory in Austin, Texas. Tesla aims to produce a quarter million Cybertrucks per year after 2024. The company had originally announced the Cybertruck in 2019 but its production was delayed multiple times. Other automakers have caught up and released their own electric pickup trucks since the announcement, but the Cybertruck still commands widespread interest.

[### Amazon says its robots will speed up delivery and definitely not replace humans (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23922202/amazon-robots-sorting-machines-sequoia-warehouse?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon is rolling out expanded robot operations at its fulfillment centers. The new robots are designed to work alongside humans instead of replacing them. They include a sortation and binning machine that moves containers from high on shelves down to workers below and autonomous robots that roll around and lift and move shelves, distribute containers, and deliver products in the building. A video of the new system is available in the article.

[### New pill helps COVID smell and taste loss fade quickly (2 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03244-7?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Ensitrelvir is an antiviral drug that shortens sensory problems. New clinical trial data suggests that it can be used to shorten loss of smell and taste from Covid-19. Up to 50% of people with Covid-19 experience impaired smell or taste. The drug has also been shown to shorten symptoms of Covid-19 by about a day. Ensitrelvir is currently available to individuals with mild or moderate symptoms in Japan. Its use has yet to be approved outside of Japan.

[### How to Scale Nuclear Power (25 minute read)](https://a16z.com/how-to-scale-nuclear-power/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nuclear reactions generate nearly 1.8 million times the energy compared to burning gasoline. Despite its many benefits, such as being able to generate very large amounts of energy without producing carbon dioxide emissions, many people fear the technology, citing fears of potential accidents and the accumulation of nuclear waste. This post aims to clarify how the technology works and help people understand how it developed. Understanding the technology is key to normalizing nuclear power as a reliable energy source.

[### China Chips and Moore‚Äôs Law (13 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2023/china-chips-and-moores-law/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US has tightened export controls for advanced AI chips being sold to China. The chip ban draws an arbitrary line at 10nm, but China already has the technology to develop 7nm chips. The real export control that will limit China's long-term development is one from the Netherlands that prevents EUV technology from going to China. While Moore's Law has appeared to slow down, chip transistor density continues to increase. The chip ban will not be effective in the short term, but it will widen the gap in technological ability over the long run.

[### OpenAI Kills Arrakis (3 minute read)](https://analyticsindiamag.com/openai-kills-arrakis/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is reportedly killing Arrakis as it didn't live up to the company's expectations during training. Arrakis was a smaller model that was supposed to allow chatbots to run more efficiently and less expensively. OpenAI had started building the model long before Llama's announcement. There is a lot of demand for smaller models, especially from Microsoft, so it is likely that OpenAI will have to release a smaller model soon.
