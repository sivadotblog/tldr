[### Tim Cook bets on Apple‚Äôs mixed-reality headset to secure his legacy (6 minute read)](https://archive.ph/Ii51W?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is expected to launch a virtual reality headset that features augmented reality capabilities this year. It will be the company's first computing platform entirely developed under Tim Cook's leadership. Cook's tenure at Apple has been influential in elevating the company's market capitalization from approximately $350 billion in 2011 to over $2.4 trillion today. Apple anticipates that it will only sell around one million headsets within the first year of its launch.

The US Treasury has designated both Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank as systemic risks and will allow both institutions to unwind in a way that involves fully protecting all depositors. Many depositors were uninsured due to the $250,000 cap on guaranteed deposits. They will have full access to their deposits from Monday. The Federal Reserve has also announced that it will launch a new Bank Term Funding Program to protect financial institutions affected by the instability caused by SVB's collapse. Shareholders and some unsecured creditors will not receive protection and will lose all of their investments.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### It Took 12 Years To Completely Map a Baby Fruit Fly‚Äôs Brain (3 minute read)](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a43266443/fruit-fly-brain/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from the University of Cambridge and Johns Hopkins University have successfully mapped every neuron and connection within the brain of a fruit fly larva. The process took 12 years. The fruit fly's brain is remarkably complex, with 3,016 neurons and 548,000 connections between them. The scientists identified 93 distinct neurons that varied in shape, function, and neurological connection. Although fruit flies have vastly different brains from humans, they share a basic biology and genetic foundation, making the discovery a good starting point for exploring the mysteries of the human brain.

[### Scientists find a way to suck up carbon pollution, turn it into baking soda and store it in the oceans (4 minute read)](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/10/world/carbon-capture-sea-water-climate-intl-scn/index.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have developed a new technique that can more efficiently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in oceans. The new method, which modifies absorbent material used in direct air capture with copper, can remove CO2 from the atmosphere at ultra-dilute concentrations with a capacity two to three times greater than existing absorbents. This could help to reduce the costs of direct air capture. Once captured, the CO2 can be turned into baking soda using seawater and released into the ocean at a small concentration.

[### Large language models are having their Stable Diffusion moment (6 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The recent release of ChatGPT sparked a renewed curiosity in generative AI, initially started in August by the Stable Diffusion moment. Machines are now able to run GPT-3 class language models locally. This article examines the impact of this technology on society and provides a guide to installing and running LLaMA on a personal machine. By allowing individuals to have a greater degree of control over the technology, there is potential for increased experimentation and development, but there are also concerns as to the ethical implications of language models.
