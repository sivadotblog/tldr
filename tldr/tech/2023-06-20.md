[### Reddit hackers demand $4.5 million ransom and API pricing changes (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/19/23765895/reddit-hack-phishing-leak-api-pricing-steve-huffman?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A ransomware group that claimed responsibility for a hack on Reddit's systems earlier this year is demanding money and policy changes. BlackCat claims to have stolen 80GB of data from Reddit. It wants a $4.5 million payout and for Reddit to roll back its planned API pricing changes in exchange for the data. The attack occurred in February. Reddit says that the hackers hadn't accessed private user data.

[### There's a Parasite That Triples Ants' Lifespans And It Actually Sounds Pretty Great (4 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-parasite-that-triples-ants-lifespans-and-it-actually-sounds-pretty-great?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Temnothorax nylanderi ants that contract Anomotaenia brevis tapeworms end up living up to over three times longer than their peers. Uninfected ants end up pampering the infected ants' and do their chores for them. The infected ants barely have to leave their nests. The tapeworms appear to pump antioxidants and other proteins into their hosts. Their goal is to eventually be eaten by a bird, so that might be why they keep infected ants young and plump.

[### Parker Solar Probe images the launch of the solar wind (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/parker-solar-probe-images-the-launch-of-the-solar-wind/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Solar wind is not very well understood despite its importance. Its immense strength has, up until now, made it nearly impossible for spacecraft to determine where it is generated. NASA's Parker Solar Probe was recently able to image the region where solar wind originates. It found that solar wind starts close to the surface and then gushes through holes in the Sun's corona before being ejected into space. The discovery could help humans predict when solar wind will head towards Earth and enable us to protect sensitive equipment.

[### GPU programming: why, when, and how? (Training Course)](https://enccs.github.io/gpu-programming/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The future of high-performance computing (HPC) systems is likely to be provided by GPUs or other types of accelerators, so programming GPUs and other accelerators is crucial to HPC system software developers. It can be difficult for developers and project owners to know how to navigate across the landscape of software and programming environments available for GPU hardware. This course is aimed at helping both software developers and decision-makers make more informed decisions on which languages or frameworks to learn and use for their projects.

[### You can't trust Google (3 minute read)](https://world.hey.com/dhh/you-can-t-trust-google-f7d64064?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google will eventually kill its services if it can't find a way to directly monetize them with ads at a scale of billions. The company is paid for advertising rather than for its products. Google's recent shutdown of Google Domains, a $180 million/year business servicing 10 million domains, is an example of this. People using Google products and services outside of the ad space should prepare a backup plan as the company is one major reorganization or promoted executive away from shutting them down.

Tech companies have essentially established a threshold for the maximum improvement of AI products as their early release will lead to model collapse, an effect where irreversible defects are created in models due to being trained on model-generated content - something that will happen once LLMs contribute to much of the content found online.
