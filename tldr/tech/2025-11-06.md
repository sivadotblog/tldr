Quantinuum's Helios machine contains 98 physical qubits, and from those, it can deliver 48 logical error-corrected qubits. The 2:1 ratio is unique - other machines require anything from dozens to hundreds of physical qubits to create one logical qubit. Quantinuum expects to create a large-scale fault-tolerant machine by 2029 with its upcoming Apollo machine, which will have thousands of physical qubits and hundreds of logical ones. Its customers include JPMorgan Chase, which has been using Helios in private preview to run complex algorithms.

More than 10,000 infants in the US are born prematurely each year. Premature birth remains the nation's second-leading cause of infant death, and those who survive it may face crippling lifelong complications. Artificial wombs promise to save more babies, but the technology raises ethical questions that need to be answered before human trials begin. If perfected, the technology could rewrite the limits of viability.

Andy Jassy recently laid out a vision for how he wants Amazon to operate like the world's largest startup. The company has been working hard to flatten its organization, getting rid of bureaucracy in order to move faster and stay competitive. Amazon announced last week it would lay off about 14,000 corporate employees and said more cuts are expected soon. The next big wave of cuts is expected to start in January. Jassy has been searching for Amazon's next opportunity - the company has made big bets on satellite internet, health care, grocery, entertainment, and self-driving vehicles.

[### Google settlement with Epic caps Play Store fees, boosts other Android app stores (9 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/google-settlement-with-epic-caps-play-store-fees-boosts-other-android-app-stores/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google and Epic have reached a settlement that will provide a framework for long-term global changes to Android app distribution. It still needs to be approved by a judge, but the changes could be put into practice by late this year. Third-party app stores will get a boost, developers will enjoy lower fees, and Google won't drag out the process for years. The agreement isn't intended to undo the jury verdict or sidestep the court's previous order, but is aimed instead at reinforcing the court's intent while eliminating potential delays in realigning the app market.
