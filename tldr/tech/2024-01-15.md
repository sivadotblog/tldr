[### Some highlights on the Starship side of the All Hands (2 minute read)](https://twitter.com/nasaspaceflight/status/1745952239984738417?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Starship's second flight almost made it to orbit - if it had a payload, that payload would have made it to orbit. SpaceX thinks it has a good shot at reaching orbit with the third flight. It will then focus on achieving full and rapid reusability. There are two towers at Starbase so one can be upgraded while the other is used for launches.

[### New Anthropic Paper: Sleeper Agents (3 minute read)](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1745854907968880970?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthropic recently trained large language models to act secretly malicious. It found that despite best efforts at alignment training, deception still slipped through. The alignment training only made models look safe. Anthropic's research shows how standard safety training might not actually ensure safety and might end up giving people a false sense of security.

[### Hidden Changes in GPT-4, Uncovered (14 minute read)](https://dmicz.github.io/machine-learning/openai-changes/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Recent changes made to ChatGPT's GPT-4 interface significantly altered the model's web browsing tools. The changes prevent the model from directly citing quotes from webpages and limits viewing of full content. This article analyzes the underlying mechanism of GPT-4 web browsing, the hidden changes, and their implications. OpenAI is increasingly under scrutiny regarding copyright laws and the reproduction of content on the internet. These changes seem to be aimed at eliminating the issue.

[### My AI Timelines Have Sped Up (Again) (30 minute read)](https://www.alexirpan.com/2024/01/10/ai-timelines-2024.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article is an update to a post in 2020 that made predictions on when artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be achieved. It defines AGI as an AI system that matches or exceeds humans at almost all economically valuable work. The previous post predicted a 10% chance by 2035, but this has now changed to a 10% chance by 2028 and a 25% chance by 2035. The author believes there is a 90% chance that humans will develop AGI by 2070.
