Vuity is an eye drop that was approved by the US FDA in late 2021 for treating presbyopia. Presbyopia is a common condition that makes the eyes unable to focus on close objects. It typically begins when people are in their 40s. The drops work by causing the pupils to get smaller, making it so that the light entering the eye is better concentrated onto the retina. They can cause issues with seeing in low-lighting conditions, but for some people, it could be a great alternative to glasses or surgery.

[### How AltStore is building a haven for forbidden iPhone apps (8 minute read)](https://www.fastcompany.com/90749170/altstore-riley-testut-iphone-sideloading-app-store?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AltStore is an app for installing apps outside of Apple's App Store. It has 300,000 monthly active users, with nearly 6,000 of those users contributing more than $14,500 per month to the app's Patreon. AltStore uses a sideloading method that Apple made available to developers.

AltStore is adding a 'Trusted Sources' section with apps that the developers have vetted themselves to lessen the risk of users installing malicious code.
