[### How File Transfer Automation Supports Security in an Age of Unstoppable Data Growth (Sponsor)](https://www.progress.com/resources/papers/how-file-transfer-automation-can-support-it-security-goals-and-data-growth?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=ft_moveit_ad_ftmod_tldr_automation_esg_wp&amp;utm_content=ft-modernization&amp;utm_term=file-transfer-automation&amp;ad_copy=security-goals-and-data-growth&amp;ad_placement=tldr-main)

How do businesses share data and knowledge? Many are still reliant on homegrown solutions‚Äîuntidy collections of manual operations, scripts and unofficial FTP clients‚Äîto transmit even their most sensitive files.

This [whitepaper by TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group](https://www.progress.com/resources/papers/how-file-transfer-automation-can-support-it-security-goals-and-data-growth?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=ft_moveit_ad_ftmod_tldr_automation_esg_wp&utm_content=ft-modernization&utm_term=file-transfer-automation&ad_copy=security-goals-and-data-growth&ad_placement=tldr-main) looks at the role of managed file transfer (MFT) in an organization's data management and migration strategy: enabling secure and efficient information sharing within the organization or between multiple organizations.

Based on [original research and analysis](https://www.progress.com/resources/papers/how-file-transfer-automation-can-support-it-security-goals-and-data-growth?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=ft_moveit_ad_ftmod_tldr_automation_esg_wp&utm_content=ft-modernization&utm_term=file-transfer-automation&ad_copy=security-goals-and-data-growth&ad_placement=tldr-main), the report will help you understand the MFT software market, the challenges it addresses and the key players.

[### Anthropic publicly releases AI tool that can take over the user's mouse cursor (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/anthropic-publicly-releases-ai-tool-that-can-take-over-the-users-mouse-cursor/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthropic's new Computer Use tool can take control of users' mouse cursors and perform basic tasks on their computers. It is now available exclusively with Anthropic's mid-range 3.5 Sonnet model via the API. It works by taking rapid successive screengrabs, so it can miss short-lived notifications and other changes and is incapable of some common actions like drag-and-drop. The tool is still cumbersome and error-prone at times. A video from Anthropic explaining the tool is available in the article.

[### Apple working on new App Store-like app dedicated to games (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/22/apple-new-app-store-like-app-games/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is reportedly working on a new App Store-like app dedicated to games that combines functionality from the App Store and Game Center in one place. It is not expected to replace Game Center, but will integrate with users' Game Center profiles. The app will allow users to find and play games and show things like challenges, leaderboards, and achievements. It will be used to promote special gaming events and information about important updates. Apple is experimenting with some kind of integration with FaceTime and iMessage on the app.

[### De-extinction company provides a progress report on thylacine efforts (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/effort-to-bring-back-the-tasmanian-tiger-builds-steam/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Colossal, a company founded to try to restore the mammoth to the Arctic tundra, released a progress report last week on the work involved in resurrecting the thylacine, which went extinct in 1936. Marsupial biology has features that may make de-extinction somewhat easier, and it appears that the technology available for working with marsupials is expanding rapidly. Colossal has a nearly complete genome sequence from a thylacine sample and it expects to complete the genome shortly. It is working on technology that will allow marsupial embryos to develop inside artificial uteruses.

[### World's 1st donor cell therapy helps 3 autoimmune disorder patients in China (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/china-autoimmune-disorder-donor-cell?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Three Chinese patients received treatment for autoimmune disorders using engineered immune cells made from donor cells. All three recipients reported improvements to their conditions. The treatment involved genetically engineering healthy-donor-derived CD19-targeting CAR-T cells using CRISPR-Cas9 to address issues with immune rejection. The study demonstrates the high safety and promising immune modularity effect of off-the-shelf CAR-T cells in treating severe refractory autoimmune diseases.

[### How we built a new powerful JSON data type for ClickHouse (23 minute read)](https://clickhouse.com/blog/a-new-powerful-json-data-type-for-clickhouse?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

JSON has become the go-to format for handling semi-structured and unstructured data in modern data systems. While it seems simple, leveraging the format effectively at scale presents unique challenges. This article explains some of the challenges ClickHouse, one of the fastest analytical databases on the market, experienced in implementing JSON support. It outlines how ClickHouse developed a new JSON type from scratch designed to address the limitations and improve the overall functionality of the now deprecated Object('json') data type.

[### Svelte 5 is alive (5 minute read)](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-5-is-alive?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Svelte 5 is finally stable after almost 18 months of development. It is the most significant release in the project's history. Svelte 5 is a ground-up rewrite, which means that apps will be faster, smaller, and more reliable. It allows developers to write more consistent and idiomatic code and there's less stuff to learn for newcomers. Svelte 5 is almost completely compatible with Svelte 4 and the initial upgrade will be completely seamless for the majority of users.

[### Learning to learn (2 minute read)](https://kevin.the.li/posts/learning-to-learn/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

When you're starting something new, the most important thing is knowing what to learn. The optimal learning flow involves very quickly identifying what the foundational knowledge is, building a personal curriculum to become an expert, and sprinting hard in the first hours to impress initial memory, then decelerating to a more regular place. Knowing how to learn is an extremely high-leverage skill. Being productively honest is one of the most effective and kindest things you can do for yourself.

[### NVIDIA Computer Finds Largest Known Prime, Blows Past Record by 16 Million Digits (2 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/nvidia-computer-finds-largest-known-prime-blows-past-record-by-16-million-digits-2000514948?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Luke Durant, a researcher, former Nvidia employee, and the most prolific contributor to the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), has discovered a new largest known prime number. Short-handed as M136279841, the number can be calculated by multiplying two together 136,279,841 times and then subtracting one. GIMPS has discovered the last 18 Mersenne primes. Durant used a supercomputer comprising thousands of GPUs in 17 different countries to find the number.
