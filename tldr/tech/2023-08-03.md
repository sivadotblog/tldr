[### Musk‚Äôs Boring Company gets OK to dig 68 miles of tunnels under Las Vegas (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/musks-boring-company-gets-ok-to-dig-68-miles-of-tunnels-under-las-vegas/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Las Vegas City Council voted last month to approve the Boring Company's plans to dig more tunnels under the city. The project will create 68 miles of tunnels and 81 stations served by Tesla vehicles able to carry three passengers at a time. Mayor Carolyn Goldman says that while there are concerns about the plan, hotels are begging for transportation options. The Boring Company claims it has transported 1.15 million passengers since its Las Vegas Convention Center Loop opened in 2021, with a peak capacity of 4,500 people per hour.

[### Google‚Äôs AI search is getting more video and better links (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23817107/google-ai-search-generative-experience-videos-links?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Users will start seeing more multimedia in the summary box on top of their search results when using Google's AI-powered Search Generative Experience (SGE). While SGE is still an experimental product, it's likely the future of Google Search. With SGE, Google is no longer just trying to find relevant links - it's trying to generate true, relevant, and helpful information. Users have reported being impressed with how useful SGE is, but complain that the service is still too slow.

[### Scramble to Validate Superconductor Breakthrough Confirms Zero Resistance, With a Catch (5 minute read)](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/scramble-to-validate-superconductor-breakthrough-confirms-zero-resistance-with-a-catch?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article covers recent developments in the race to validate a recent claim about a major breakthrough in material physics and discusses some of the reasons why the finding still hasn't been confirmed. It's only a matter of time before LK-99's superconductivity claims are fully confirmed or denied. Independent research teams have already synthesized the material and have found some interesting properties. No team has completely confirmed the findings yet.

[### Meta releases open source AI audio tools, AudioCraft (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/open-source-audiocraft-can-make-dogs-bark-and-symphonies-soar-from-text-using-ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AudioCraft is a suite of generative AI tools from Meta for creating music and audio from text prompts. It allows content creators to generate complex audio landscapes, compose melodies, and simulate entire virtual orchestras by inputting simple text descriptions. AudioCraft uses AudioGen for audio effects and soundscapes, MusicGen for musical compositions, and a neural network-based audio compression codec. A link to Meta's blog post about AudioCraft, which contains several samples generated with the tools, is available in the article.

Many founders in the early 2010s thought that working within a thriving social scene of peers would help them percolate ideas as they built their startup, but there are no famous success stories from people who tried. Working in solitude allows for serious work to be done. Being in an environment where the opinions of others matter can kill ideas quickly. This essay analyzes the working notes of several highly creative individuals to distill different approaches to developing a creative state.
