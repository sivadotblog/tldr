The next AirPods Pro will be able to see its surroundings to provide hand gesture recognition and create an enhanced spatial audio experience with the Apple Vision Pro headset. They will be released at the same $249 price as the current model. Apple tends to wait around three years to make major changes to AirPods, so it is unclear whether the company plans to release a new high-end version of the AirPods Pro 3 or a full-fledged AirPods Pro 4. All AirPods announcements so far have been made at Apple's annual iPhone event in September.

[### Write-Only Code (12 minute read)](https://www.heavybit.com/library/article/write-only-code?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

We are moving toward a future where a large amount of production code will never be read by a human. This Write-Only Code future will happen when software production scales beyond human attention. The organizations that will succeed in this transition will be the ones that invest early in new primitives for trust, accountability, and control.

[### Opus 4.6, Codex 5.3, and the post-benchmark era (10 minute read)](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/opus-46-vs-codex-53?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI and Anthropic both recently unveiled the next iterations of their coding assistants. Benchmarks are getting less and less meaningful as coding assistants get better. Over time, the industry will develop better ways of articulating the differences in agentic models, but for now, people will have to experience them for themselves, or read other people's experiences about them, to track frontier models. Consistent testing and clear articulation will be the only way to monitor the pace of progress in agentic capabilities in the near future.
