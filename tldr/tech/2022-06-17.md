[### The first perovskite solar cell with a commercially viable lifetime is here (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/perovskite-solar-cell-commercially-viable-lifetime?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from Princeton University have built perovskite solar cells that last long enough to be commercially viable. Perovskite solar cells are highly efficient and low-cost, but they are also fragile, with the first perovskite solar cells developed lasting barely minutes. The team developed a new technique for testing how solar devices will perform in the long term. The new perovskite solar cells can run at or above 80% of their peak efficiency for 30 years in a city like Princeton.
