[### Apple's 'Ferret' is a new open-source machine learning model (2 minute read)](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/12/24/apples-ferret-is-a-new-open-source-machine-learning-model?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from Apple and Cornell University quietly released an open-source multimodal LLM in October. Ferret is a system that can refer and ground anything anywhere at any granularity in an image. The model can examine a region drawn on an image, determine the elements within it that are of use to a user in a query, identify the elements, draw a bounding box around the detected elements, and answer questions about the elements. Ferret's release shows that Apple is starting to be more open with its AI work.

[### Self-Checkout Haters -- and Retailers -- Can Rejoice: A New Machine Rings Customers Up Automatically (3 minute read)](https://www.inc.com/bruce-crumley/self-checkout-haters-retailers-rejoice-new-machine-rings-customers-up-automatically.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Uniqlo has developed a new self-checkout technology that uses RFID chips to transmit product details and prices when shoppers are in scanning range. Customers just have to drop off their goods into a basket and the checkout machine will list the goods prices on a screen that tells them what to pay. The process takes around 30 seconds and has been highly popular with customers. The technology has been deployed at several locations, including the chain's New York shop on Fifth Avenue.

[### Quantum Computing‚Äôs Hard, Cold Reality Check (6 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-computing-skeptics?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A small but vocal set of prominent skeptics in and around the emerging quantum computing industry say that the quantum computer revolution is still further off and more limited than many have been led to believe. Quantum computers have been touted as a solution to a wide range of problems and some of the more ambitious timelines have suggested that these machines could be impacting real-world problems in just a handful of years. However, there's growing pushback against these expectations as more is discovered about quantum computing.
