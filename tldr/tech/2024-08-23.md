Epic launched its iOS store in the EU last week thanks to new regulations opening up the platform. It's not clear whether Epic will be able to grow the store far beyond its own games. While Epic's game store may offer better terms for developers, every developer is still subject to fees from Apple. Epic is in active discussions with almost every one of the top 250 mobile developers about putting their apps on the Epic Games Store for mobile, but almost all of them have said they can't make it work on iOS.

Polaris Dawn, a collaboration between SpaceX and Shift4 CEO Jared Isaacman, will launch on Monday. The mission will send four astronauts in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on an orbit that will carry them through the innermost of the Van Allen belts, the bands of high-energy radiation that surround our planet. Two of the crew members will complete a spacewalk midway through the 5-day mission. The mission will be the first flight test of SpaceX's new pressure suits for extravehicular activities.

[### A newly approved ‚Äòliving drug' could save more cancer patients' lives (19 minute read)](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newly-approved-drug-save-cancer-patient?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Iovance Biotherapeutics has developed a 'living drug' made up of immune cells from patients' own tumors. The therapy involves taking the immune cells from the patient's tumor, growing them in the lab, and then infusing them back into the body. The massive influx of immune cells zeros in on and attacks cancer cells, and in some cases, appears to wipe out every last one. The drug doesn't work for everyone, but it can still be a lifesaver for some patients. It has been approved in the US for advanced melanoma.

This post provides a history of Elastic Block Store, one of AWS's foundational services. It covers queuing theory, the importance of comprehensive instrumentation, and the value of incrementalism versus radical changes. EBS's development team's approach, which was to make a series of incremental improvements over time, allowed them to develop customer value sooner and course correct as they learned more about changing customer workloads. They were able to make significant improvements to the service without taking it online.
