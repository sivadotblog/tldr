It is focused on building foundational technology rather than commercial applications and has committed to open-sourcing all of its models. This article contains an in-depth interview with Deepseek's CEO Liang Wenfeng, which covers Deepseek's ambitions for AGI, why the AI Lab views open source as the dominant strategy, how Deepseek hires and organizes researchers, why Chinese firms settle for copying and commercialization instead of 'hardcore innovation', and how Deepseek plans to ignite more 'hardcore innovation' across the Chinese economy.

[### China to Plant 'Flapping' Flag on Moon: A Lunar First (4 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/china-to-plant-flapping-flag-on-moon-a-lunar-first?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China plans to place a free-standing flag designed to 'flap' on the airless surface of the Moon. The flag will have closed-loop wires embedding into its fabric - it will 'flap' using magnetic currents and electromagnetic interactions to create a waving motion. The flag will be installed in late 2026 when Chang'e 7 heads to the Moon. Chang'e 7, destined to land near the edge of Shackleton Crater in the Moon's south polar region, is designed to carry out some serious science - the area it is landing in is suspected to contain water ice.

[### Lawyer explains why Apple can't bring TikTok back to the App Store yet (1 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/22/lawyer-explains-why-apple-cant-bring-tiktok-back-to-the-app-store-yet/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple has removed TikTok from its App Store because of the company's obligation to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. While President Trump has assured that the law banning TikTok would not be enforced, some experts say the promise offers minimal security. Trump could change his mind at any time or selectively enforce against companies that fall from political favor. Future administrations would almost certainly be free to pursue violations. The financial consequences of non-enforcement could be severe, even for a company of Apple's stature.
