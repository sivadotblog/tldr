[### A new AI-powered gene-editing technique could be set to replace CRISPR (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/ai-dna-editing-zinc-fingers?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from the University of Toronto and the NYU Grossman School of Medicine created simple, modifiable proteins called 'zinc fingers' with the aid of artificial intelligence. Zinc fingers are one of the most common types of protein structures. They guide DNA repair by grabbing enzymes and telling them to cut out the wrong parts of the code. Genetic engineers can adjust any gene's activity by altering these zinc fingers' instructions. Zinc-finger editing could be a safer alternative to CRISPR.
