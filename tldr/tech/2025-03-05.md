[### NASA uses GPS on the moon for the first time (2 minute read)](https://www.popsci.com/science/blue-ghost-gps-moon/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost has successfully demonstrated the ability to use Earth-based GPS signals on the Moon. Accurate and reliable navigation will be vital for future missions to the Moon. NASA currently tracks spacecraft using a mix of onboard sensors and Earth-based tracking signals, which generally requires oversight from a team of engineers. Using GNSS could reduce the need for human operators as the signals can be autonomously picked up by spacecraft.

[### Trimodal Nature of Tech Compensation in the US, UK, and India (28 minute read)](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US is unique in having a tier above Big Tech. Across the UK, India, and the Netherlands, the highest compensation is Big Tech, but in the US, hedge funds, quant firms, and top scaleups can pay more. However, these positions are usually reserved for workers already in Big Tech, and switching can be difficult. It's a lot harder now to get into top-tier companies in today's tough job market.
