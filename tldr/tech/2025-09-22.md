[### Apple takes control of all core chips in iPhone Air with new architecture to prioritize AI (9 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/21/apple-now-controls-all-core-iphone-chips-prioritizing-ai-workloads.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The iPhone Air contains Apple's A19 Pro, N1, and C1X chips, making it the most power-efficient iPhone ever made. The A19 Pro chip introduces neural accelerators to each GPU core to increase compute power. The N1, Apple's first wireless chip for the iPhone, has improved Wi-Fi functionality that enables more power-efficient location tracking. The C1X modem is up to twice as fast as the C1 and uses 30% less energy than the Qualcomm modem in the iPhone 16 Pro. Using its own silicon gives Apple more control, allowing it to do things beyond what it could do by buying merchant silicon parts.

[### Tesla gives big hint that it will build Cyber SUV, smaller Cybertruck (4 minute read)](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-gives-big-hint-build-cyber-suv-smaller-cybertruck/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Cyber SUV and a smaller Cybertruck could potentially be added to Tesla's lineup soon. While the company has not confirmed its plans for the vehicles, a recent promotional video Tesla released seemed to show a mock-up design of the Cyber SUV in plain sight. A smaller Cybertruck design would allow fans in Europe and Asia to purchase the all-electric pickup. There have been regulatory concerns in some countries about the size and sharp edges of the Cybertruck, increasing the need for an 'international' version.

[### Building Nuclear Power in the US Is Tough. NASA Wants to Do It on the Moon (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/science/space-astronomy/nasa-moon-nuclear-energy-race-2d9ef1d6?st=caF1qy&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US, China, and Russia are racing to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon. The countries have been exploring the idea of jointly deploying nuclear energy on the Moon by the mid-2030s, but NASA leaders are worried that a rival could potentially use its own station to establish a keep-out zone on the lunar surface, limiting US efforts to build up its own presence. NASA now aims to land a reactor on the Moon by late 2029. The agency expects to lean on US industry to design a reactor, get it to the Moon, and operate it.

[### Making real gains in war on Alzheimer's (14 minute read)](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/09/making-real-gains-in-war-on-alzheimers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

New technologies like AI are helping scientists find new ways to understand and possibly help treat Alzheimer's disease. Scientists are now looking at the possible role of lithium deficiency as a cause in the onset and progression of the disease. The cost for care of patients with the disease is estimated to increase to $1.5 trillion per year by 2050. If scientists are unable to change the course of the disease, then the only real treatment will be physical and palliative care.

[### What's the limit of what can be in a TXT record? (3 minute read)](https://dgl.cx/2025/09/images-over-dns?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

TXT records contain multiple character-strings that are limited in length. The size of a TXT record is limited by the size of the DNS payload, which for TCP is up to 64KB. This could have security implications as it allows attackers to tunnel large payloads to browsers.

[### Interception (6 minute read)](https://aifoc.us/interception/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Interceptium is a proof of concept that routes web requests through a large language model to generate custom outputs. It passes request data to models that generate HTML that is returned to the browser. These 'interceptors' can craft pages to users' needs and preferences without any input. There are a lot of risks and challenges with this approach, but the goal of the project was only to consider future browser functionalities, as AI's ability to customize and adapt the web is incredibly powerful.

[### Low-risk defi can be for Ethereum what search was for Google (8 minute read)](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/09/21/low_risk_defi.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

For a long time, there has been tension in the Ethereum community between applications that bring in enough revenue to sustain the ecosystem and applications that satisfy the underlying goals that brought people to the ecosystem in the first place. Low-risk DeFi fills both of these boxes at the same time. It could help Ethereum achieve global democratized access to payments and savings in valuable asset categories. Low-risk DeFi is already positively changing the world in many underprivileged regions.

The new TikTok deal will involve Oracle handling data and privacy, and a new board for the company with a majority of American directors. TikTok's recommendation algorithm will be 'controlled by America' but it is unclear whether it will be licensed or altered. While the deal hasn't been signed, it appears that China will support the framework.
