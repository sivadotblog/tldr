[### Bill that could ban TikTok in the U.S. gains momentum in Congress (5 minute read)](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/bill-ban-tiktok-us-gains-momentum-congress-rcna142047?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new bi-partisan legislation may force ByteDance to divest TikTok or risk having it banned in US app stores. The bill, dubbed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, creates a process for identifying certain social media applications under the control of foreign adversaries as national security threats. Apps deemed a risk would be banned from online app stores and web hosting services unless they sever ties with entities under the control of foreign adversaries within 180 days of the designation. There are concerns that TikTok could be used by the Chinese government to access personal data from its users and show them videos that could influence their views on particular issues.

The next test aims to achieve nominal first-stage performance, Starship separation from the first stage using 'hot staging', Starship reaching an orbital velocity and engine shutdown, early-stage testing on in-space refueling technology, and a controlled splashdown of Starship in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX intends to launch Starship at least nine times this year.

Meta plans to make WhatsApp and Messenger interoperable with third-party messaging services as required by the Digital Markets Act. Engaging with third-party chats will be an opt-in experience for users. Third parties have been asked to use the Signal protocol, but they will be allowed to use other protocols as long as they are able to demonstrate that the protocol offers the same security guarantees as Signal. Third parties that connect to Meta will be responsible for hosting any files their client apps send to Meta's users. They will need to sign an agreement with Meta before the company will enable interoperability.
