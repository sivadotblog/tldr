### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists can now grow wood in a lab without cutting a single tree (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/lab-grown-wood?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from MIT have developed a technique to produce wood products of any shape or size. The technique involves giving stem cell-like properties to normal plant cells and using a gel-based medium enriched with nutrients and hormones to stimulate the cells into becoming wood. Using this technique, the scientists were able to grow wood at a rate twice that of regular trees. The team was able to 3D print custom-designed structures out of the cells cultured in the gel. The research could eventually lead to the end of deforestation.

[### Scientists grow cells on a robot skeleton (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/26/23142769/tissue-engineering-growing-cells-mobile-robot-skeleton?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from the University of Oxford and robotics firm Devanthro grew cells on a robot skeleton in an experiment designed to create more flexible lab-grown cells. The researchers used the robot skeleton to recreate the cells' natural growing environment as accurately as possible. The cells were grown over two weeks, during which they were 'exercised' every day. While the experiment showed that it was possible to grow cells in this way, the scientists could not tell whether the technique produced cells better than those grown in a static environment.
