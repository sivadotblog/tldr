The administrative state touches everything in the US like net neutrality, climate change, clean air and water, and consumer protections. Since 1984, the administrative state has largely run on one Supreme Court precedent: Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council. This law enabled federal agencies to deal with issues that legislators have yet to cover. The decision has now been overturned. It is still unclear what the repercussions of this change may result in - it could completely change the ways courts review agency rulemaking.
