[### Spanish mathematician Javier G√≥mez Serrano and Google DeepMind team up to solve the Navier-Stokes million-dollar problem (6 minute read)](https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-06-24/spanish-mathematician-javier-gomez-serrano-and-google-deepmind-team-up-to-solve-the-navier-stokes-million-dollar-problem.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Navier-Stokes equations are one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems - the US-based Clay Mathematics Institute has offered $1 million for the solution. Google DeepMind and mathematician Javier G√≥mez Serrano claim the problem will be solved soon with the help of AI. The challenge dates back to the 19th century. Several great mathematical minds have devoted the best years of their academic lives to solving the problem only to find themselves stuck in a dead end.

[### Begun, the AI Browser Wars Have (13 minute read)](https://spyglass.org/ai-browser-wars/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Browser Company's new Dia browser shows an obvious glimpse of what's to come in the world of web browsers. It is a lot simpler than Arc, but the AI trade-offs make it worth the switch. Established players like Chrome have billions of users, making it difficult for them to fundamentally change their browsers overnight. With Dia, The Browser Company has a clean slate to do as it wishes - and it appears to be a good product right now.

[### Rack-scale networks are the new hotness for massive AI training and inference workloads (13 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/25/rack_scale_networking/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Rack-scale architectures use interconnect technologies to offer several orders of magnitude higher bandwidth per accelerator. The bandwidth means that GPU compute and memory can be pooled, even when physically distributed across multiple distinct servers. The transition to rack-scale architectures is being driven by the demands of model builders. They are primarily aimed at hyperscale cloud providers, neo-cloud operators, and large enterprises that need to keep their AI workloads on-prem.
