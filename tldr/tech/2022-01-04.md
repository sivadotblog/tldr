[### GAF Energy‚Äôs easy-install solar shingles aim to outshine Tesla roofs and traditional panels (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/gaf-energys-easy-install-solar-shingles-aim-to-outshine-tesla-roofs-and-traditional-panels/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

GAF Energy's Timberline Solar shingles can be installed by any roofer with a nail gun. They are weatherproof and can be walked on for roof maintenance. Other solar shingles require specialists to install, which increases the cost of installation, especially for rural areas where there may also be lower availability. GAF Energy is the first company to receive UL‚Äôs new building-integrated photovoltaic solar roofing certification.

[### Dementia-preventing nasal spray moves to human trials (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/science/dementia-nasal-spray-rifampicin-resveratrol-human-trials/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A novel nasal spray designed to prevent the neurodegeneration associated with dementia has shown promising results in mouse studies. The spray is a combination of two pre-existing drugs. Mice with neurodegenerative diseases showed improved cognition and less accumulation of toxic proteins in the brain after the spray was intranasally administered five times a week for a month. The combination of drugs was more effective at preventing neurodegeneration than each drug by itself. Human trials will start soon in several countries, including Japan and the US.

[### China‚Äôs ‚Äòartificial sun‚Äô is five-times hotter than the real thing (2 minute read)](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/china-artificial-sun-nuclear-fusion-renewable-b1985795.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) fusion reactor in China reached temperatures of 70 million degrees Celsius, five times hotter than the Sun, for more than 17 minutes during a recent experiment. EAST aims to deliver near-limitless clean energy by mimicking the natural reactions occurring within stars. The project has already cost China more than ¬£700 billion. The EAST team will provide technical support for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) currently being constructed in France. ITER will be the world's largest reactor once completed.
