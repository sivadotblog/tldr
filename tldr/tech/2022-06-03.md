[### Manipulating photons for microseconds tops 9,000 years on a supercomputer (9 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/manipulating-photons-for-microseconds-tops-9000-years-on-a-supercomputer/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An optical quantum computer built by Canadian startup Xanadu is able to sometimes perform operations with more than 200 qubits. Simulating one of the operations, which only takes a few-dozen milliseconds on the optical quantum computer, would take 9,000 years on a supercomputer. Xanadu's hardware uses a chip to put photons in a specific quantum state then it forces photon pairs to interact in ways that entangle them. More details about the technology are available in the article.

[### Woman receives 3D-printed ear made from her own cells (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/2/23151690/3d-printed-ear-transplant?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

3DBio Therapeutics has successfully transplanted a 3D-printed ear made from human cells onto a woman born with a rare ear deformity. The experimental process involves taking a biopsy from the patient's ear and pulling out cartilage cells, which are then grown and 3D printed into the shape of an ear. The implant is less likely to be rejected as it is made from the patient's own cells. It was the first clinical trial of the technology.

[### Scientists create an optical illusion that feels like an expanding black hole (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/black-hole-optical-illusion?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A psychologist from Japan has created an optical illusion that makes the viewer feel as if a black hole is getting bigger. The image looks like a black hole surrounded by tiny black dots. The illusion affects the dilation of pupils in human eyes. It works even when the size or color scheme is changed. Test subjects' pupils underwent contraction when they were shown white-colored holes instead of black. Optical illusions are essential applications for studying how the brain functions and responds to different stimuli. The optical illusion is available in the article.

[### HP‚Äôs Linux-based AMD laptop releases, starts at $1,099 (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/hps-linux-based-amd-laptop-releases-starts-at-1099/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)
