### Big Tech & Startups

[### This is Big Tech's playbook for swallowing the AI industry (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/1/24190060/amazon-adept-ai-acquisition-playbook-microsoft-inflection?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Building leading AI models is extremely costly - raising $400 million isn't even enough to compete these days. Big Tech has the cash, but it isn't allowed to buy companies like it once did due to antitrust enforcement. It has turned to aquihiring - hiring most of a company's employees and acquiring everything in a company but its name. While the current antitrust enforcement regime will likely try to block these types of acquisitions, it may not have a strong legal argument for doing so.

Chinese space startup Space Pioneer accidentally launched its Tianlong-3 rocket during a static fire test. The booster broke free from the test stand due to a structural failure. It flew several hundred meters into the sky before crashing explosively into a mountain 1.5 kilometers away from the test site. The test site is located about 5 kilometers away from the downtown area of a city with 800,000 people and less than a kilometer from a smaller village. The company reported that there were no casualties as a result of the accident.

[### Scientists Create Robot Controlled by Blob of Human Brain Cells (3 minute read)](https://futurism.com/neoscope/robot-human-brain-cells?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese researchers have created a robot controlled by a tiny organoid made from human stem cells. The brain tissue is hooked up to a neural interface, allowing it to pass instructions to the humanoid robot body. The setup will allow researchers to study brain-computer interfaces and help develop techniques for integrating organoids with the human brain. Organoids could one day be used to repair the human brain through transplantation.

[### Problematic second (13 minute read)](https://sarvendev.com/2024/07/problematic-second/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The leap second was invented to compensate for the difference between the value measured by atomic clocks and the actual time the Earth revolves around the Sun. These seconds are usually added on the last day of June or December. Poor time synchronization can lead to data loss and other problems. Leap seconds are added rarely, so they inevitably cause problems almost every time they are added. This article looks at leap seconds and the various problems they have caused.

[### Supreme Court protects the future of content moderation (11 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/1/24166388/supreme-court-ruling-moody-paxton-texas-florida-social-media-law?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A decision issued by the Supreme Court on Monday explicitly extends First Amendment protections to how social media platforms organize, curate, and moderate their feeds. The compilation and curation of others' speech into an expressive product of its own is entitled to First Amendment protection. Platforms are making expressive choices when they use their Standards and Guidelines to decide which content to display or how the display will be ordered and organized. The government cannot get its way just by asserting an interest in better balancing the marketplace of ideas.
