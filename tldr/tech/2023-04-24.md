[### Apple will launch a journaling app in iOS 17, but that‚Äôs bad news for some devs (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/apple-plans-mental-health-focused-journaling-app-for-ios-17/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple will unveil a personal journaling app at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The app will be pre-installed on iOS 17 and deeply integrated with location services, contacts, and other phone features. Apple plans to position the app as a mental health tool. The app will look at local data to determine what a typical day looks like for the user and make recommendations on what users might want to journal about. Its close integration with user data and other pre-installed apps will make it difficult for other journaling apps to compete.

[### Scientists May Have Figured Out How to Regenerate Lost Hearing (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/neoscope/scientists-figured-out-regenerate-lost-hearing?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Harvard Medical School scientists have created a cocktail of molecules that they claim can successfully regenerate hair cells in the inner ear that enable hearing. The treatment works by reprogramming genetic pathways in the inner ear. It has been tested in mice and the scientists are now working towards human clinical trials. If successful, the research could have a profound impact on individuals with hearing loss.

[### Watch a rocket-powered spaceplane fly for the first time (3 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/space/spaceplane?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Dawn Aerospace flew its rocket-powered spaceplane for the first time on March 29. The New Zealand-based company conducted two more tests in the next two days. Dawn's rocket-powered spaceplane is designed to fly to space twice a day. Its reusable design means that it can send objects into space for cheaper. The spaceplane is able to fly without clearing each flight with regulators as it takes off and lands horizontally from a runway. A video of the spaceplane taking off is available in the article.

[### Prompt Engineering vs. Blind Prompting (14 minute read)](https://mitchellh.com/writing/prompt-engineering-vs-blind-prompting?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Blind prompting, a method of creating prompts using a crude trial-and-error approach paired with minimal or no testing, is not prompt engineering. Many people who claim to be prompt engineering are really just blind prompting. Prompt engineering is a real skill that can be developed based on real experimental methodologies. This article uses a realistic example to walk through the process of prompt engineering a solution to a problem that provides practical value to an application.
