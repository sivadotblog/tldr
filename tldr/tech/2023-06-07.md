[### Scientists find way to make aging hair regrow by manipulating stem cells (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/scientists-find-way-to-make-aging-hair-regrow-by-manipulating-stem-cells?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have discovered a new method for helping aging hair regrow in mice. Hair follicle stem cells get stiff as they age, making it harder for them to grow hair. They are more likely to produce hair if the stem cells are softened. The researchers were able to soften the stem cells by boosting the production of a tiny RNA. This enhanced hair growth in both young and old mice. The mice started to grow hair within 10 days.

[### Why AI Will Save the World (6 minute read)](https://a16z.com/2023/06/06/ai-will-save-the-world/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI will not destroy the world, but in fact, may save it. AI is the application of mathematics and software code to teach computers how to understand, synthesize, and generate knowledge in ways similar to how people do it. It can make everything we care about better by profoundly augmenting human intelligence. AI augmentation of human intelligence has already started. Restrictions, regulations, and laws target dramatic public statements about the dangers of AI, but these concerns may be inflated and could result in the slowing down of technology that could be enormously beneficial to our welfare.

[### Vision Pro (15 minute read)](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Vision%20Pro?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article looks at Apple Vision Pro's user interface and computing paradigm. visionOS is organized around apps, similar to iOS. The interface allows wearers to use 2D iPad app UIs on a large spatial display. Users control the device by looking at items and then 'clicking' on them with their fingers. Apple has positioned the device as a spatial computing device. This new paradigm gives users more space to use the apps they currently use. It is yet to be seen whether developers will embrace the paradigm to create new use cases.
