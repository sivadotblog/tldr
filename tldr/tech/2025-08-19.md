Agentic transformation is redefining work with [autonomous AI agents](https://orkes.io/webinars/humans-agentic-ai-the-future-of-enterprise-automation-is-collaborative?utm_campaign=TLDR-flagship-August&utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=referral) that act with memory, context, and adaptability. But without trust, orchestration, and human oversight, these systems risk compliance gaps, runaway costs, and decisions you can't explain.

Join our [upcoming webinar this Thursday, August 21st](https://orkes.io/webinars/humans-agentic-ai-the-future-of-enterprise-automation-is-collaborative?utm_campaign=TLDR-flagship-August&utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=referral), to see how Orkes Conductor embeds humans-in-the-loop for contract reviews, compliance checkpoints, and high-stakes approvals. Discover Slack and dashboard integrations for control and visibility, plus guardrails like token limits, fallback orchestration, and budget tracking. Includes a live demo. [Times: 11 am CT & 6 pm CT.](https://orkes.io/webinars/humans-agentic-ai-the-future-of-enterprise-automation-is-collaborative?utm_campaign=TLDR-flagship-August&utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=referral)

[### The Weight of a Cell (8 minute read)](https://www.asimov.press/p/cell-weight?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

We know that a single yeast cell weighs about 100 picograms and a single E. coli bacterium weighs about one picogram. While we now have devices that can measure individual cells with femtogram precision, scientists decades ago had to make do with whatever was already in the lab. The weight of an individual yeast cell was first measured with little more than a microscope, sugar water, and a camera. Measuring E. coli required a completely different strategy. This post looks at these early experiments to show how phenomena that seem difficult to measure can be overcome through mathematics and first principles thinking.

[### Just people in a room (9 minute read)](https://www.bonnycode.com/posts/just-people-in-a-room/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Group projects suck, but they give students opportunities to run into human problems in a safer environment. We are all just people with our own biases, blinded to our own faults. Growing up means learning to question ourselves while still trusting ourselves. By reflecting on ourselves, little by little, we become better people.

[### The Billion-Dollar Game Built in a Dorm Room (8 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/arts/counter-strike-half-life-minh-le.html?unlocked_article_code=1.fU8.jq3I._i0OxKn51nOV&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Minh Le created Counter-Strike from his dorm room at Simon Fraser University, a public research school just outside Vancouver, British Columbia. The game, officially released in the fall of 2000 by Valve Corporation, spawned half a dozen sequels and an esports vertical that continues to generate billions from the sales of cosmetic weapon skins. It has influenced decades of shooters and is arguably one of the most important video games ever made. Counter-Strike's influence is vast nearly 25 years later - even Call of Duty has offered a bomb defusal mode lifted straight out of Counter-Strike.
