[### Current fuel mix and uses (12 minute read)](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2025/12/08/energy-predictions-2025/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

We're in the middle of a period of rapid transition in energy. Solar is decosting at an accelerating rate, coal is shrinking, and nuclear is flat. Primary production will soon be mostly solar. Batteries will be everywhere, and the grid will shrink. Datacenters, which are already building their own captive power plants, will become power sources for their communities. Substantial cost improvements are still needed to make space AI competitive.

[### Has the cost of building software just dropped 90%? (8 minute read)](https://martinalderson.com/posts/has-the-cost-of-software-just-dropped-90-percent/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

We are in the early stages of a once-in-a-generation shift. The economics of building software have changed dramatically with agentic coding. Previous assertions that LLMs make too many mistakes or can't understand codebases or frameworks are rapidly becoming completely false. The technology is going to totally transform the software development industry.

[### LLM weights vs the papercuts of corporate (5 minute read)](https://ghuntley.com/papercuts/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Model weight first companies are companies where the majority of the software was code-generated. These companies do not require as much context engineering and do not need to adhere to classical principles as much as corporate companies. They achieve much higher velocity/productivity/success rates using AI because they are not forcing models to follow pre-existing dogma. Companies having problems with AI are likely trying to bend the technology to their whim rather than working with it.

Paramount Skydance is launching a hostile bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. It will go straight to shareholders with an all-cash, $30 per share offer. The offer is supported by equity financing from the Ellison family, Middle Eastern financing partners, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and other parties.

The modifications allow the deal to be outside of the jurisdiction of the Committee of Foreign Investment in the US.
