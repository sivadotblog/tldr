Between GitHub, Jira/Linear, and Slack, engineering teams create data for days.

Engineering work can be measured. But if you measure the wrong things, you‚Äôll destroy motivation and productivity.

[Swarmia](https://www.swarmia.com/engineering-metrics/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=email&utm_medium=cpv&utm_content=september23) has identified [key metrics](https://www.swarmia.com/engineering-metrics/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=email&utm_medium=cpv&utm_content=september23) that are more signal than noise (think DORA and SPACE), and metrics that you should avoid at all costs.

In: ‚úÖ¬†Business outcomes. ‚úÖ¬†Flow. ‚úÖ¬†Developer experience.

Out: ‚ùå¬†Leaderboards. ‚ùå¬†Individual performance data.
