It has the potential to streamline web search by eliminating the need for multiple search queries and link exploration. The system uses a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o.

[### Alexa's New AI Brain Is Stuck in the Lab (22 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-10-30/new-amazon-alexa-ai-is-stuck-in-the-lab-till-it-can-outsmart-chatgpt?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy)

Amazon executives were confident a beta version of a new and improved Alexa was doable by early 2024. However, the timeline started slipping - the deadline has been moved to 2025. Alexa's conversational abilities have improved, but it still has issues and struggles with some tasks. Getting Alexa right is important for Amazon given the huge portion of kids and families that use Echo hardware.

Cloud milking is a zero-energy technique for extracting water from fog. The technique mimics the way that the leaves capture water droplets from fog. It involves erecting special structures in the path of the wind to collect water droplets as the wind blows fog through them. Cloud milking is revolutionizing the recovery of forests devastated by fire and drought.

[### How to Accelerate Code Reviews with Nudges: Insights from Microsoft's Study (8 minute read)](https://reviewnudgebot.com/blog/how-to-accelerate-code-reviews-with-nudges-insights-from-microsofts-study/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Pull requests (PRs) are essential for ensuring code quality and enabling collaboration across teams, but they can become major bottlenecks. Microsoft and the Delft University of Technology conducted a comprehensive study that analyzed 22,875 pull requests to uncover the key factors that contribute to delays in PR completion. The study led to the development of Nudge, an automated system designed to send timely 'nudges' to authors and reviewers. Using Nudge reduces PR completion times by 60%. This article looks at the key insights from Microsoft's research and explores how nudges transform the code review process.
