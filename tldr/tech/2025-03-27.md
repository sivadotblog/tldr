[### Google will develop the Android OS fully in private, and here's why (7 minute read)](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google is doing away with its current two-pronged Android development strategy and instead shifting all development internally starting next week. The company previously maintained a public branch and an internal development branch, which resulted in Google spending a lot of time and effort merging patches between the two branches. This change doesn't mean that Google is becoming closed-source - the company will continue to publish the source code for new Android releases, but the frequency of public source code releases for specific Android components will change.

[### OpenAI Expects Revenue Will Triple to $12.7 Billion This Year (2 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/openai-expects-revenue-will-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzA0NTUyMywiZXhwIjoxNzQzNjUwMzIzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFFJQ0FEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.i_UUGPUguo7t9I6EfK1keOp6PnN-j8ZED348TbKx_X8&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI plans to more than triple its revenue this year - it generated $3.7 billion in annual revenue last year. The company hit 2 million paid users for the corporate version of ChatGPT in September. It more recently added a $200 monthly ChatGPT Pro option and is considering charging thousands of dollars per month for certain AI products. The company does not expect to be cash-flow positive until 2029. It has been in talks with regulators to restructure into a for-profit public benefit corporation.

[### Upcoming Private SpaceX Mission Will Boldly Go Where No Human Has Orbited Before (2 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/upcoming-private-spacex-mission-will-boldly-go-where-no-human-has-orbited-before-2000580917?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Fram2 mission will launch four private astronauts into polar orbit to observe Earth's polar regions at an altitude of around 265 to 280 miles above the ground. It is set for launch on board a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket no earlier than Monday, March 31 at 11:20 PM ET. The four-person crew will be led by Chun Wang of Malta, who founded Bitcoin mining companies f2pool and stakefish. The astronauts will spend three to five days on board SpaceX's Dragon crew spacecraft as they study an aurora-like phenomenon known as STEVE (Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement), known for its hazy purple and green streaks across the sky. The mission will also include an attempt to grow mushrooms in space.

[### Firefly Aerospace selects Blue Origin unit to explore volcanic formations on moon (1 minute read)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/firefly-aerospace-selects-blue-origin-unit-to-explore-volcanic-formations-on-moon/ar-AA1Byr19?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Firefly Aerospace has partnered with Blue Origin's Honeybee Robotics for its third lunar mission in 2028. Honeybee will supply a rover to study the Gruithuisen Domes, unusual volcanic formations located in the Moon's near side believed to be rich in silica. Studying the formations could unlock clues about the Moon's geological history and potential resources for future human missions. The upcoming mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative.

[### MCP ü§ù OpenAI Agents SDK (1 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1904957755829481737.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Model context protocol (MCP) is a way to provide tools and context to a large language model. It is an open protocol that provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. OpenAI's Agents SDK now has support for MCP, enabling developers to use a wide range of MCP servers to provide tools to Agents. The company is still working on MCP support for the OpenAI API and ChatGPT desktop app.

[### A love letter to the CSV format (4 minute read)](https://github.com/medialab/xan/blob/master/docs/LOVE_LETTER.md?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

CSV is often criticized for the wrong reasons. It has many strengths - CSV is dead simple, open and free, text-based, streamable, can be appended to, and succinct. It is dynamically typed, letting developers parse values as they see fit. Reverse CSV is still valid CSV, which means the last rows of a CSV file can be read very efficiently and easily - just feed the bytes of the file in reverse order to a CSV parser. Excel hates CSV, which clearly means CSV must be doing something right.

[### The Vibe Shift Amongst Apple Developers (4 minute read)](https://spyglass.org/vibe-coding-apple-devs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's AI product offerings are non-competitive. Software development is moving faster than ever before, and Apple looks like it is increasingly likely to miss out on a generation of developers conditioned on tools like Cursor, Replit, or v0. The company's AI tools remain notably absent. AI may change the equation enough for Apple to shift its stance, but that could take years. Apple could change all of this with web distribution, but that would be very risky for the company.

[### Has the Decline of Knowledge Work Begun? (7 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/business/economy/white-collar-layoffs.html?unlocked_article_code=1.7E4.ak5s.jXPs3iO04dFq&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The unemployment rate for college graduates has risen 30% since bottoming out in September 2022. Hiring rates have slowed more for jobs that require a college degree than for other jobs. Some economists say that these trends may be short-term in nature and little cause for concern on their own, but there are other signs that the returns on a college degree may have shifted over a longer period - the gap in wages between those with college degrees and those without has flattened during the past 15 years, though it remains large. The flattening of the gap may reflect employers' reduced need for college graduates.
