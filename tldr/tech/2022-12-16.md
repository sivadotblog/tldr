OpenAI's recent pitch to investors predicts that the organization will earn $200 million in revenue next year and $1 billion by 2024. The company charges developers by licensing its technology. It costs around a penny to generate about 20,000 words of text and about 2 cents to create images with written prompts. OpenAI has not revealed its financials or revenue strategy. The company uses a capped-profit structure that limits investor returns to 100 times their investment.

[### Meta, Microsoft, AWS, and TomTom launch the Overture Maps Foundation to develop interoperable open map data (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/15/meta-microsoft-aws-and-tomtom-launch-the-overture-maps-foundation-to-develop-interoperable-open-map-data/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Overture Maps Foundation is a program driven by Amazon Web Services, Meta, Microsoft, and TomTom, hosted by the Linux Foundation. It aims to counter Google and Apple's dominance in the map data realm by developing datasets that can be used and reused across applications and businesses. Creating an open data set will allow companies to bypass restrictions that Google and Apple place on their data and avoid paying for licensing. The Foundation aims to release its first datasets in the first half of 2023.

[### Try ‚ÄòRiffusion,‚Äô an AI model that composes music by visualizing it (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/15/try-riffusion-an-ai-model-that-composes-music-by-visualizing-it/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Riffusion is an AI that produces music using images of audio. It was created by fine-tuning Stable Diffusion on spectrograms. Spectrograms are visual representations of audio that show the amplitude of different frequencies over time. Riffusion creates spectrogram images with enough fidelity to convert into audio. Examples of music created with Riffusion, along with a link to a live demo of the AI, are available in the article.

[### Molecule that mimics insulin opens new doors for a diabetes pill (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/medical/molecule-mimics-insulin-diabetes-pill/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Australian scientists have identified a molecule that activates receptors in a similar way to insulin. Insulin pills are difficult to make due to the instability of the hormone and its inability to pass through the digestive tract without being broken down. While there is still a lot of work to be done before a diabetes pill can be created, the discovery shows that there are other molecules that can mimic insulin and other unexplored pathways for managing diabetes.
