### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Alzheimer's drug lecanemab hailed as momentous breakthrough (5 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-63749586?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Lecanemab is the first drug to slow the destruction of the brain in Alzheimer's. It attacks the beta amyloid that builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Lecanemab only has a small effect and it only works in the early stages of the disease. Despite this, leading researchers are calling the findings 'momentous'. Other therapies so far have had a 100% failure rate.

[### Fusion power is 'approaching' reality thanks to a magnetic field breakthrough (2 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/fusion-power-magnetic-field-ignition-study-195200137.html?src=rss?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at the Energy Department's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have used a new magnetic field set up to more than triple the energy output of fusion reaction hotspots. The magnetic field traps heat within the hotspot, boosting the energy yield. While the finding makes ignition considerably more achievable, the output is still far less than required to create self-sustaining reactions.
