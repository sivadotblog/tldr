SpaceX's plan to upgrade Starlink with gigabit internet speeds has received partial approval from the US FCC. The company can now launch 7,500 more satellites, operate its constellation at lower orbits, and use a larger swath of radio frequencies. SpaceX has received a time-limited waiver to operate the Starlink network at higher power levels to improve speeds. The waiver is confined to Starlink operations in the US.

[### When Google Locked the Door, Three MIT Students Picked the Lock (11 minute read)](https://www.implicator.ai/when-google-locked-the-door-three-mit-students-picked-the-lock/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

DeepMind shipped AlphaFold 3 last spring, but its code was locked, weights were restricted, and commercial applications were forbidden. By December, three MIT PhD students had reverse-engineered the architecture and released their own version. Boltz is available on GitHub under Apache 2.0 for anyone to download. The Boltz team now has $28 million in funding and a Pfizer partnership, showing how the industry is willing to reject Google's closed approach and instead build around it.

[### Agent-native Architectures (52 minute read)](https://every.to/guides/agent-native?source=post_button&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Claude Code demonstrated that large language models with access to bash and file tools can accomplish complex multi-step tasks autonomously by operating in a loop until an objective is achieved. Good coding agents are really good general-purpose agents. The Claude Code software development kit makes this accessible. It allows developers to build applications where features are achieved by agents with tools. This opens up a new field of software that works the way Claude Code works, but in categories far beyond coding.

[### Don't fall into the anti-AI hype (8 minute read)](https://antirez.com/news/158?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Whatever you may feel about AI, skipping it will not help you or your career. Test these new tools with weeks of work, and find a way to multiply yourself. If it doesn't work out, try again every few months. AI allows you to build more and better. While you might not be writing the code yourself, the fun of creating is still there, untouched.

[### The "AI-Generated Hit Movie" Horror Story (9 minute read)](https://spyglass.org/ai-generated-hit-movies/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Roku's CEO predicts that the first 100% AI-generated hit movie will be released in the next three years. AI-generated video is already flooding social media, so it is not unreasonable to believe that fully AI-generated movies will be possible in three years. The bigger question is whether there will be an audience for that content. It is likely that AI-generated content will raise the demand for human-generated content. There may be a market for hybrid content, but a purely AI-generated movie topping the box office by 2029 is unlikely.
