[### Google Chrome is switching to Manifest V3, but what does that mean for ad blockers? (9 minute read)](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-manifest-v3-ad-blockers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While Manifest V3 makes things harder for ad blockers, it's not the death of ad blockers by any stretch. uBlock Origin already has a new version built on Manifest V3 that works almost as well as the Manifest V2 version and with added privacy and performance benefits. However, there are quite a few filtering capabilities that can't be ported to Manifest V3. There are tools in Chrome's Extensions settings that help users determine whether an extension is compatible with Manifest V3 and find alternatives for incompatible extensions.
