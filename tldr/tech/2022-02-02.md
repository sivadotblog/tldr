[### Tesla recalls over 54,000 models over FSD update that disobeys stop signs (2 minute read)](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-recalls-over-54000-models-over-fsd-update-that-disobeys-stop-signs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has issued a recall of 53,822 Tesla vehicles due to the Assertive mode on the company's Full Self-Driving software. Cars set on Assertive mode may perform rolling stops at all-way-stop intersections under certain conditions. It is unclear how often this occurs and there are no known crashes, injuries, or fatalities related to the issue. The rolling-stop functionality can be disabled through an over-the-air update, so Tesla owners likely won't need to go to any service centers.
