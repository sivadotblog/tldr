Current and former OpenAI employees who spent at least two years in the company may have the opportunity to sell approximately $6 billion worth of shares to an investor group that includes Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group Corp., and Dragoneer Investment Group. The deal would value OpenAI at $500 billion. Talks for the deal are still in an early stage, and the size of the sale could still change. The sale will allow OpenAI employees a chance to get cash-rich amid a high-stakes talent war in the artificial intelligence industry.

[### SpaceX reveals why the last two Starships failed as another launch draws near (13 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/08/spacex-reveals-why-the-last-two-starships-failed-as-another-launch-draws-near/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX has received launch approval for the 10th full-scale test flight of its Starship rocket. The launch is scheduled for no earlier than August 24 at 6:30 pm local time in Texas. Starship's record in 2025 so far has not been great, with four failed test flights and the explosion and destruction of another Starship vehicle during a ground test in June. A good outcome on the text Starship test flight will give SpaceX footing to continue to step forward on its roadmap.

[### Biotech's Lost Archive (22 minute read)](https://ifp.org/biotechs-lost-archive/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

FDA submissions contain unparalleled details about the design of clinical trials, manufacturing processes, safety assessments, and reviewer correspondences, but this information is not publicly available. This article details a proposal for a legally grounded mechanism for democratizing FDA filings. Freeing FDA submissions from obscurity would level the playing field for small biotech firms, academic teams, and nonprofits and enable AI-driven regulatory intelligence tools that dramatically lower compliance costs and accelerate approval timelines. AI stands to revolutionize drug development, but only if it can be trained on high-quality unredacted datasets.

Good system design is about knowing how to use boring, well-tested components in the right place. Using exciting tools will usually end up in a mess.

[### Building a web search engine from scratch in two months with 3 billion neural embeddings (34 minute read)](https://blog.wilsonl.in/search-engine/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Search engines seem to be getting worse. Better quality results should rank higher than the prolific inorganic content and engagement bait everywhere today. Transformer-based text embedding models show amazing natural comprehension of language - this technology can be used to find great content, insights, and references. This article details a project where a developer tries to build a web search engine from scratch using neural embeddings. Embeddings appear far more powerful than traditional search.

[### China's vision for a driverless future is miles ahead of everyone else's (10 minute read)](https://restofworld.org/2025/china-ai-powered-self-driving-cars/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China's autonomous vehicle industry is nearing a tipping point. The country is already the world's largest auto market and a global leader in electric and autonomous vehicles. By 2030, a fifth of new cars sold in China will be fully driverless, and 70% will feature advanced assisted-driving technology. The country's push to build infrastructure gives it a significant advantage in deploying autonomous vehicles. Its AV market shows no sign of slowing - many regions will want to partner with China to upgrade their infrastructure.

[### 35 Thoughts About AGI and 1 About GPT-5 (27 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uAbbEz4p6tcsENaRz/35-thoughts-about-agi-and-1-about-gpt-5?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

GPT-5's release felt uneventful. It is still not Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and it still gets things wrong - the model is supposed to be able to decide for itself whether it needs to use its thinking mode for harder problems, but many reports show that it often gets this wrong. Large language models perform well with crystallized knowledge, which masks their shortcomings with fluid intelligence. AGI has the potential to change how we do everything very soon after it is achieved, but we still have to figure out how to get there.
