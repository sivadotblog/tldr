In role-based access control (RBAC), each user has a role, each app section has a permission, and you're checking the user has the right to do what they're doing on every action or page load.

Sounds reasonable enough? The problem is that apps have gotten much more complicated, and contain a lot more user input, making RBAC implementations complicated and unwieldy. This has led to the rise of [Fine Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-fine-grained-authorization?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-tech&utm_campaign=20241121).

This [blog post](https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-fine-grained-authorization?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-tech&utm_campaign=20241121) covers:

* FGA basics and data model
* Building resolver logic
* Centralized vs decentralized FGA
* Frontend considerations
* FGA and IdPs
