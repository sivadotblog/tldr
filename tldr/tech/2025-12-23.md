[### It Sure Seems Like the Foldable iPhone Will Be a Wide Boi (3 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/it-sure-seems-like-the-foldable-iphone-will-be-a-wide-boi-2000702475?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's Foldable iPhone is rumored to have an aspect ratio similar to that of Apple's largest iPads when viewed in landscape mode. It is expected to arrive in the fall of 2026 along with the iPhone 18 Pro. A wider foldable could help distinguish the device from Android book-style foldables. Samsung is apparently planning to release its own foldable with a wide aspect ratio in Q3 2026 to compete with the foldable iPhone.

Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, still wasn't sure how people would use Instagram's TV app on Amazon Fire the day before the integration rolled out. The team knew they would get things wrong, but they were ready to learn and iterate quickly. Instagram is likely to change dramatically in the next few years. The platform plans to let users proactively shape content on their feeds in a way that will feel fundamentally different.

[### Scientists find a way to 'reboot' vision in adults with lazy eye (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/medical/reboot-vision-adults-lazy-eye/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Lazy eye, or amblyopia, can occur when one eye is deprived of vision early in life. The lack of input disrupts synapse formation in the brain's primary visual cortex, weakening vision in that eye. A new mouse study has found that briefly and reversibly anesthetizing the retina of an amblyopic eye for just a few days can restore the brain's visual responses to that eye. While it is clear that the treatment seems to reset the way the brain engages with specific neurons, scientists still haven't figured out exactly why this is happening.

[### Your Laptop Isn't Ready for LLMs. That's About to Change (10 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-models-locally?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Laptop designs need to be upgraded to make running AI models locally possible. The average laptop is underpowered for large language models. The most obvious way to boost a PC's AI performance is to place a powerful NPU alongside the CPU. Another upgrade required for PCs to run AI models is a unified memory architecture that provides all system resources to the same pool of memory over a fast, interconnected memory bus.
