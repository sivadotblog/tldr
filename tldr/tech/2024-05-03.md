[### SpaceX Adds Cosmic Tourism Offering to Website (4 minute read)](https://www.flyingmag.com/spacex-adds-cosmic-tourism-offering-to-website/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new 'Human Spaceflight' tab on SpaceX's website offers flights to Earth's orbit, the International Space Station (ISS), the Moon, and Mars, with missions beginning as early as this year. There is no pricing information for the offerings and interested customers will have to inquire through email. The Earth orbit mission, which will last three to six days, offers a view of the planet from 300 kilometers high for two to four passengers. Ten-day commercial missions to the ISS will be available as early as 2025. The missions to lunar orbit and Mars do not have listed timelines.

[### Found: the dial in the brain that controls the immune system (6 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01259-2?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have identified the brain cells that regulate inflammation and determined how they keep tabs on the immune response. The neurons that act as the master dial for the immune system live in the brain stem, the stalk-like structure that connects the bulk of the brain to the spinal cord. The finding could lead to treatments for autoimmune diseases and other conditions caused by an excessive immune response. The mechanism by which the brain sends signals back to the immune system to regulate inflammation remains unclear.

[### Not all Graphs are Trees (6 minute read)](https://buttondown.email/jaffray/archive/not-all-graphs-are-trees/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Relational algebra can easily be represented as trees as formulas are already structurally rooted trees where each operator has its inputs as children. Things get more complicated when introducing non-tree structures, like some kind of self-join. This can be resolved using inlining (simply duplicating the expression you want to reference twice) or let binding. Common methods to open up unrestricted access to represent graphs containing cycles in programs include self-referencing, using a fix point operator, and explicitly listing edges.

[### offset-allocator (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/pcwalton/offset-allocator?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

offset-allocator is a fast, simple, and hard real-time allocator especially useful for managing GPU resources. It is a port of Sebastian Aaltonen's OffsetAllocator package for C++, rewritten in 100% safe Rust. While the general algorithm in the crate could be adapted to construct a Rust allocator, this is beyond the scope of the implementation. offset-allocator is completely agnostic to what it's allocating. It only knows about a contiguous block of memory of a specific size.

[### U.S. v. Google: As landmark 'monopoly power' trial closes, here's what to look for (8 minute read)](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/02/1248152695/google-doj-monopoly-trial-antitrust-closing-arguments?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The trial for the US Department of Justice's case against Google for using anti-competitive tactics to monopolize online search is now over and closing arguments are underway. Google's parent company Alphabet controls roughly 90% of the US search engine market, but the company claims its success is due to the quality of its product, not because of its business dealings. The ruling for the case could have far-reaching effects on how people use and interact with the internet. If the judge rules against Google, the consequences could be anything from fines to a restructuring of the company.
