### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### mRNA breakthrough offers a potential heart attack cure (3 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/health/mrna-heart-attack-cure?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from King's College London have developed an mRNA vaccine that reverses damage caused by heart attacks. Cardiac muscle cells are starved of oxygen and can be damaged or killed during a heart attack, leaving scar tissue. The vaccine delivers code that stimulates new heart cells to grow, creating functional muscle rather than a scar. The treatment has been successfully tested with pigs. The researchers hope to begin human clinical trials within two years.

Scientists in China have developed an extremely fast charging technology that can charge a lithium-ion battery to up to 60 percent capacity in under six minutes. The technology involves a redesigned anode with a porous architecture and graphite particles strewn throughout. It could help electric vehicles reach the US Department of Energy's Fast Charge Goal of 10 miles of travel per minute of charging.

[### My experience getting a tech job with no degree or relevant work experience (6 minute read)](https://lowlyswe.substack.com/p/my-experience-getting-a-tech-job?s=r?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article details the experience of how a college dropout was able to land a tech job without a degree or relevant work experience. Being able to learn by yourself is a large part of the job, so early experiences with learning how to use computers were valuable. Many things can be learned online for free, but having a set curriculum, mentors, and groups to work with is very motivating and beneficial. Bootcamps can provide networks that lead to employment.

[### Watch Rocket Lab try to capture a booster in mid-air with a helicopter (1 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/watch-rocket-lab-try-to-capture-a-booster-in-mid-air-with-a-helicopter-193004065.html?src=rss?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Rocket Lab successfully attempted a mid-air capture of its Electron rocket's first stage yesterday. The first stage was recovered by a Sikorsky S-92 helicopter, often used for military or presidential purposes. It caught the rocket mid-air by hooking onto the booster's parachute as it descended back to Earth. A webcast of the launch and recovery is available in the article.
