Apple quietly formed a new team called Answers, Knowledge, and Information earlier this year. The group is exploring a number of in-house AI services with the goal of creating a new ChatGPT-like search experience. Apple recently started advertising job openings for the team, with several listings specifically mentioning experience with search algorithms and engine development.

[### Reddit plans to unify its search interface as it looks to become a search engine (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/reddit-plans-to-unify-its-search-interface-as-it-looks-to-become-a-search-engine/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### These drones drop burning balls in the forest to control wildfires (8 minute read)](https://www.popsci.com/technology/drones-wildfires/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

One of the oldest methods of preventing wildfires is doing controlled burns, which preemptively remove leaves, dead branches, and other dry materials. Nebraska-based startup Drone Amplify uses small quadcopter drones carrying hundreds of ping-pong ball-sized combustible eggs to ignite small, trackable, and contained fires. Its drones are currently operating more than 200 systems in the US, Canada, Germany, and Australia. Using drones enables better monitoring as well as nighttime operations.

[### Synthetic E. coli with compressed DNA outsmarts viruses in radical genetic leap (4 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/recoded-ecoli-syn57-genetic-code?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at Cambridge have created synthetic E. coli bacteria with just 57 codons - virtually all known life has 64. Syn57 has the most radically compressed genetic code ever built. The technique used to create the strain opens up the possibility of future organisms that can create unnatural materials and virus-resistant biofactories. Syn57 may be immune to many viruses, as viruses rely on the host's genetic code to replicate.

Apple CEO Tim Cook recently rallied employees around the company's artificial intelligence prospects at a rare all-hands meeting following earnings results. He told staff at the meeting that the AI revolution is as big or bigger than the internet, smartphones, cloud computing, and apps. Apple was late to AI, and its AI tools fell flat when they were finally released. However, Cook noted that while Apple is typically late to promising new technologies, it invents the modern versions of those product categories.
