[### After 21 years, Basecamp remains the most refreshingly straightforward way to manage projects (Sponsor)](https://basecamp.com/?utm_campaign=sponsorship&amp;utm_medium=digital&amp;&amp;utm_source=tldr)

There's big investor money in project management. That's a big incentive to make bloated, barely-useable products ‚Äî designed to tick boxes in a procurement manager's checklist.

[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/?utm_campaign=sponsorship&utm_medium=digital&&utm_source=tldr) has been bucking this trend for more than two decades. It's famously [no-nonsense, effective, and reliable](https://basecamp.com/?utm_campaign=sponsorship&utm_medium=digital&&utm_source=tldr). It's designed for smaller, hungrier businesses who just need to get things done.

And it's still going strong ‚Äî without spending hundreds of millions of VC dollars on marketing.

No superbowl ads. No tacked-on AI.

Just the features you need to manage projects ‚Äî from chat (bye bye Slack) to Kanban to docs.

[### IVF breakthrough using 3‚Äëperson DNA leads to 8 babies born free of genetic disease (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/breakthrough-ivf-leads-eight-healthy-births?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Eight babies were born healthy thanks to a groundbreaking new DNA-enhanced IVF technique aimed at preventing children from inheriting severe, incurable mitochondrial diseases from their mothers. The babies were born to seven mothers at high risk of passing on severe mitochondrial DNA diseases. The novel IVF method utilizes DNA from the mother's egg, the father's sperm, and healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor. Children conceived via this technique inherit the vast majority of their DNA from their biological parents, but they also receive a minute amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from a third person, a genetic alteration that will be passed down to future generations.

[### NASA's new Roman Space Telescope aims to discover 100,000 cosmic explosions (4 minute read)](https://www.popsci.com/science/roman-space-telescope-future-discoveries/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope has a field of view at least 100 times larger than Hubble's. It has the potential to document light from over a billion galaxies over its career. The telescope will help researchers better understand exoplanets, infrared astrophysics, and the nature of dark matter. Roman could potentially find evidence of the very first stars to ever form in the universe. The telescope is scheduled to launch in 2027.

[### How Android phones became an earthquake warning system (6 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/how-android-phones-became-an-earthquake-warning-system/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Android Earthquake Alert system, which is on by default in most Android phones, displays a notification to users when there is an earthquake nearby to warn them to get to a safer location. The system uses accelerometers to detect vibrations - an alert is triggered when there is widespread phone activity that matches the pattern expected for an earthquake. As of the end of March last year, the system has sensed a total of 1,279 events, ranging in magnitude from 1.9 to 7.8, of which only three were false positives.
