Tesla plans to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin on June 12. The date has only been discussed internally and could still change. The company this week operated a test vehicle on public roads in Austin with no one in the driver's seat for the first time. Elon Musk said earlier this month that Tesla would officially roll out a fleet of about 10 self-driving robotaxis in Austin before expanding to a thousand vehicles within a few months.

[### China to visit Earth's ‚Äòquasi-moon' and bring a chunk of it back home (3 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/29/china_tianwen_2_probe_launch/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China's National Space Agency has launched an asteroid sample mission aimed at Asteroid 2016HO3, aka 469219 Kamo ªoalewa, which orbits the Sun. The Tianwen 2 probe rode a Long March 3B rocket into orbit at 1:31 Thursday morning. 2016HO3 is estimated to have a diameter of 40 to 100 meters. It is an attractive target for exploration because it can be reached by a spacecraft traveling at a modest 7 kilometers per second. The probe will reach the asteroid in about a year and then orbit it for a while before landing and attempting to retrieve around 100 grams of material.
