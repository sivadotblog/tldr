It looks similar to Twitter, with an interface that gives users the option to like, comment, repost, and share threads. Users can choose to log in with their Instagram usernames or create a new account. Threads does not currently support ActivityPub, but there are plans to integrate the protocol later down the line. The app is not available in the EU due to the EU's strict privacy regulations.

[### Heat Pumps - The Well-Tempered Future of A/Cs (6 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/heat-pump-air-conditioning-alternative?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Air-conditioners keep people comfortable and alive. Extreme heat waves are killing more and more people every year. The demand for more air-conditioners is exacerbating climate change due to increased demand for electricity and the leakage of refrigerants. Both winners of the 2021 Global Cooling Prize were heat pumps that reduce cooling's climate impact by up to 80 percent. Heat pumps address the problems of emissions while providing a source of emissions-free power. They're also comparatively cheaper to install than central air-conditioners.
