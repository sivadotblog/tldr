[### Etsy sellers are officially on strike (2 minute read)](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/etsy-seller-strike?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

More than 14,000 Etsy workers are striking from 11 to 18 April to protest the company's increase in transaction fees. The workers are asking the company to cancel its fee increase, take down resellers who offer mass-produced goods, introduce a faster seller support system, allow sellers to opt-out of off-platform advertising, and end the Star Seller program. Etsy says its new fee increase will allow it to invest in marketing, customer support, and moderation. The company's revenue gains grew more than 106% in 2020 to $10 billion, and by another 31% in 2021.

The company plans to have a production line up and running by 2024 and launch an EV with a solid-state battery by 2028.

[### Elon Musk won‚Äôt join Twitter board, can thus exceed 14.9% ownership cap (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/04/elon-musk-wont-join-twitter-board-can-thus-exceed-14-9-ownership-cap?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal has announced that Elon Musk won't be joining Twitter's board of directors. If Musk had joined the board, he would have been barred from owning more than 14.9% of the company during his time on the board and for 90 days after. There is a high likelihood that Musk will take a more hostile stance toward Twitter and increase his active stake in the company. Musk recently tweeted a series of criticisms, suggestions, and jokes about the social media platform. He has since deleted most of the tweets except for one that asks whether Twitter is dying.
