[### Moderna says mRNA flu vaccine sailed through trial, beating standard shot (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/moderna-says-its-mrna-seasonal-flu-shot-is-27-better-than-current-vaccine/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Moderna's mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccine was 27% more effective at preventing influenza infections than a standard flu shot in a study that included nearly 41,000 people aged 50 and above. The new shot, dubbed mRNA-1010, hit the highest efficacy target set for the trial. The positive results come in the wake of one of the worst flu seasons in years. An estimated 770,000 people in the US were hospitalized for the flu during the 2024-2025 flu season.

Tesla claims that its lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery cell factory in Nevada is nearly ready to start production. The company's cheapest electric vehicles all utilize LFP cells, as does its entire range of energy storage products - it currently heavily relies on Chinese manufacturers. Tesla aims to produce about 10 GWh of LFP battery cells per year at the new factory. The cells are expected to be used in the Tesla Megapack, which is produced in the US.

[### Context Engineering Realized: Context Window Architecture (4 minute read)](https://mrhillsman.com/posts/context-engineering-realized-context-window-architecture/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Context Window Architecture (CWA) is a conceptual reference architecture aimed at bringing engineering discipline to every large language model (LLM) prompt construction. It directly addresses fundamental limitations with LLMs, including statelessness, cognitive fallibility, and ad-hoc prompting. The real value of an AI application isn't just the LLM, but the system intelligently managing its context. Adopting CWA increases reliability, predictability, debuggability, and security; lowers maintenance requirements; creates clear control points for sensitive data, ethical guidelines, and compliance; and provides a shared vocabulary and mental model for collaborative development.

[### I Shipped a macOS App Built Entirely by Claude Code (19 minute read)](https://www.indragie.com/blog/i-shipped-a-macos-app-built-entirely-by-claude-code?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Context is a native app for debugging MCP servers powered by Apple's SwiftUI framework. It was built almost completely by Claude Code. Of the 20,000 lines in the project, less than 1,000 lines were written by hand. This post explains how Context's developer chose their tools, what those tools are good at and bad at, and how other developers can leverage them to maximize the quality of their generated code output. IDEs of the future will focus on enabling developers to prime context for agents and set up the feedback loops that are essential to helping agents succeed with tasks.

Companies and organizations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia are turning to large language models from Chinese companies as alternatives to offerings from the US. While US AI technology is widely seen as the industry's gold standard, Chinese companies offer performance that is nearly as good at vastly lower prices. Leading Chinese AI companies have open-sourced their models, which could pressure rivals in the US to justify keeping their models private and the premiums they charge for their services.
