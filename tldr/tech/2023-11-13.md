[### Scientists build yeast with artificial DNA in a major synthetic biology advance (5 minute read)](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/09/synthetic-biology-yeast-artificial-genome?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have created synthetic versions of the 16 chromosomes in a yeast cell and successfully combined some of them in one cell. The feat is a key step towards creating programmable cellular factories. It also revealed sequences in genes that interrupted a key process in cells that led to mitochondria dysfunction. The team is now working to combine all the chromosomes into one cell that can survive. If successful, the technology could be used to produce biofuels, medicines, and other materials using cells.

[### AI that reads brain scans shows promise for finding Alzheimer‚Äôs genes (4 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03482-9?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have developed AI-based approaches for shifting through genomes to identify genes linked to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The combination of genomics, brain imaging, and AI allows researchers to find indicators that are tightly linked to a genomic driver. Scientists have had access to massive research databases for decades, but sifting through this data has proven to be a challenge. AI is able to sort through and learn from the data more efficiently and produce consistent results. If the approach works, it could also be applied to other diseases that have a physical presentation in brain imaging.
