[### ‚ùå üíæ Cut Kafka costs by up to 80% (Sponsor)](https://aiven.io/inkless?utm_source=---&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;&amp;utm_content=tldr)

Your Kafka cluster is costing you - and often more than you think. Teams pay big-data prices for small-data streams, and burn engineering hours managing stateful brokers.

[Aiven Inkless (KIP-1150)](https://aiven.io/inkless?utm_source=---&utm_medium=sponsored&&utm_content=tldr) redefines Kafka with a diskless architecture. Data is written directly to object storage (S3), and any broker can handle any partition.

No local disks, no replication tax - and it all runs directly in your VPC.

>> Slash your total cost of ownership by up to 80%

>> Keep running open-source Kafka

>> Reduce on-call toil

[### Google's AI Cracks a New Cancer Code (3 minute read)](https://decrypt.co/344454/google-ai-cracks-new-cancer-code?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google's latest biological AI system has generated and experimentally confirmed a new hypothesis for cancer treatment. It could lead to a promising new pathway for developing therapies to fight cancer. Cell2Sentence-Scale 27B (C2S-Scale) is a 27-billion-parameter foundation model for single-cell analysis built on Google's Gemma family of models. The discovery shows that scaling up biological AI models can result in them producing entirely new hypotheses.

[### New Apple M5 is the centerpiece of an updated 14-inch MacBook Pro (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/new-apple-m5-is-the-centerpiece-of-an-updated-14-inch-macbook-pro/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's new 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro are the first devices to get the new M5 processor. The M5 features four high-performance CPU cores, six high-efficiency CPU cores, 10 GPU cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine. Its biggest upgrade is a leap in memory bandwidth that helps contribute to a 30% increase in GPU performance and a 45% increase in ray-traced GPU performance relative to the M4. The GPU includes a Neural Accelerator in each core that improves the performance of GPU-based AI workloads by up to 400%.

[### SpaceX Offers New Look at V3 Starlink Satellite for Gigabit Speeds (2 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-offers-new-look-at-v3-starlink-satellite-for-gigabit-speeds?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Starlink V3 is significantly longer and larger than its predecessors. It uses a pair of longer solar arrays, and the central satellite bus is also bigger. The improvements will enable the satellites to deliver gigabit internet speeds. The larger size explains why SpaceX needs to use Starship to deploy V3 satellites rather than on a Falcon 9. Each V3 could weigh up to 2,000 kilograms.

[### Inside the Colorado factory where AtmosZero is electrifying steam (6 minute read)](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/colorado-factory-atmoszero-industrial-decarbonization?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AtmosZero is building novel steam-producing heat pumps to replace the gas-burning boilers that factories rely on. Its Boiler 2.0 machine can be installed in a day in a process that is as simple as replacing an old gas boiler. While it isn't as efficient as other heat pumps, it is easier and cheaper to install, making it an attractive choice for factories that don't want to disrupt operations. AtmosZero aims to crank out 120 to 240 heat pumps per year by 2030.

[### Designing APIs for vibe coding (6 minute read)](https://slinkydeveloper.com/blog/designing-apis-for-vibe-coding/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Vibe coders discover APIs by asking their LLMs to solve a problem. This means apps looking to increase their vibe-ability will need to make it easier for LLMs to discover and correctly use their APIs. Flat and verbose beats concise, and conformity beats originality. This could mean there will be fewer innovative API designs in the future and that adoption might become tougher for newer programming languages.

[### Spotify & Netflix Gun for YouTube's Eyeballs (3 minute read)](https://spyglass.org/spotify-netflix-video-podcasts-youtube/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Spotify has partnered with Netflix on video podcasts to compete with YouTube. Netflix will require videos not to be posted to YouTube in full as part of the deal, so only clips for promotional purposes will be allowed. Netflix can't hope to scale in the way YouTube has without user-generated content. This Spotify deal gives Netflix more content.

[### Title Arbitrage as Status Engineering (16 minute read)](https://www.humaninvariant.com/blog/titles?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Titles are an imperfect signal of how one contributes to an organization. Title arbitrage shifts the relative status of certain positions and changes what people want to work on. Title deflation abandons leveling schemes in favor of flatter hierarchies. Some title refactors are simple name changes, while others are signals that a company is taking an opinionated view of the world. Title arbitrage and deflation are attempts to rewrite the status hierarchy and reshape culture from the top down.
