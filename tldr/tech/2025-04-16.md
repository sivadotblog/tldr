[### OpenAI is reportedly developing its own X-like social media platform (1 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/openai-is-reportedly-developing-its-own-x-like-social-media-platform/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is in the early stages of building its own X-like social media network. The company currently has an internal prototype that contains a social feed focused on ChatGPT's image generation. It is unknown whether the company plans to launch the social network as a standalone app or if it plans to integrate it within the ChatGPT app. Having a social media app would allow OpenAI to access real-time data to contain its AI models.

[### Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg considered spinning off Instagram from Facebook in 2018: FTC trial (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/15/meta-ceo-zuckerberg-considered-spinning-off-instagram-2018-ftc-trial.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mark Zuckerberg considered spinning Instagram out of Meta in 2018 due to concerns about the rising threat of antitrust litigation against Facebook. He had predicted that there would be a non-trivial chance that Meta would be forced to spin out Instagram and WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years. The company is currently being accused of monopolizing the social networking market - Instagram and WhatsApp are at the heart of the antitrust trial, which seeks to cleave the apps from Meta as a possible remedy. Meta disputes the allegations and says that regulators are failing to acknowledge a number of rivals.

[### Deep sea craft filmed unprecedented footage of a colossal squid (3 minute read)](https://mashable.com/article/colossal-squid-first-ever-live-footage?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists captured rare footage of a colossal squid on March 9 off the South Sandwich Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The observed colossal squid was a juvenile and not fully grown at about a foot long - mature individuals grow to around 23 feet long and weigh over 1,100 pounds. It was found swimming at around 1,968 feet beneath the surface. This is the first confirmed live observation of a colossal squid in its natural habitat. Video of the young squid is available in the article.

[### One dose of experimental drug nearly wipes out stealthy cholesterol in 'remarkable' trial (4 minute read)](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/one-dose-experimental-drug-nearly-wipes-stealthy-cholesterol-remarkabl-rcna198014?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Lipoproteins are a type of cholesterol that is undetected by routine tests and undeterred by existing drugs, diet, or exercise. People with high levels of the cholesterol are at extremely high risk of cholesterol buildup in their arteries, which raises their odds of heart attack, stroke, and early death from cardiovascular problems. Eli Lilly has developed a drug called lepodisiran that dramatically reduced levels of lipoproteins for up to one year. The effects waned after a year but only slightly.

Many engineering managers, directors, heads of engineering and startups, and mid-sized companies are reporting that they are currently finding it harder to hire than ever. Some previously common hiring approaches, like coding problems and take-home exercises, no longer work. Candidates are likely to inevitably hit potholes that AI assistants are able to fix eventually.

Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz and his lawyer are now in Dubai, complicating Rippling's efforts to serve Buoaziz over a lawsuit that accuses him of bribing a Rippling employee to spy on the company. The UAE has a reputation for being a safe haven for those wanting to avoid extradition. Its legal environment makes extradition very difficult, although the country has told the media it is committed to working with international partners on law enforcement and recently stepped up extraditions of some long-wanted criminals. Deel has responded to the lawsuit by denying all wrongdoing.
