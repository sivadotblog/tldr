[### Major ChatGPT-4o update allows audio-video talks with an ‚Äúemotional‚Äù AI chatbot (6 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI announced a new AI model yesterday called GPT-4o that can converse using speech in real time, read emotional cues, and respond to visual input. It will roll out over the next few weeks for free to ChatGPT users and as a service through API. Paid subscribers will have five times the rate limits of free users. The API will feature twice the speed, 50% lower cost, and five times higher rate limits compared to GPT-4 Turbo. A 26-minute long video that introduces GPT-4o and demonstrates its abilities is available in the article.

Meta is reportedly working on AI-powered earphones equipped with cameras. Internally codenamed 'Camerabuds', the earphones will leverage AI capabilities for real-time object identification and foreign language translation. Meta's leadership sees AI-powered earphones as the next logical step in the evolution of wearable technology. It has partnered with Kansas-based electronics company Ear Micro to explore the possibilities of this emerging technology.

[### $16k G1 humanoid rises up to smash nuts, twist, and twirl (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/robotics/unitree-g1-humanoid-agent/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Unitree has released the first few details on its G1 Humanoid Agent, a $16,000 robotic helper. The robot is equipped with 3D LiDAR sensors, a depth camera, three-fingered grippers, and a 9,000-mAh battery pack. It can recover from brutal kicks and punches, as seen in the short demo video in the article. At around 35 kg, the robot can fold itself down to 690x450x300-mm proportions for compact carry.

[### Using MRI, engineers have found a way to detect light deep in the brain (6 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2024/using-mri-engineers-have-found-way-detect-light-deep-brain-0510?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists often label cells with proteins that glow to measure changes in gene expression, but this technique is difficult to apply to structures deep within the brain as light scatters too much before it can be detected. MIT engineers have engineered blood vessels to express a protein that causes them to dilate in the presence of light. This dilation can be observed with magnetic resonance imaging, allowing researchers to pinpoint the source of light. The new technique allows researchers to explore the inner workings of the brain in more detail than previously possible.

[### pg\_lakehouse (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_lakehouse?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

pg\_lakehouse is an extension that transforms Postgres into an analytical query engine over object stores. Querying non-operational data by moving it into a cloud data warehouse or operating a new query engine is expensive and time-consuming. pg\_lakehouse allows this data to be queried directly from Postgres, eliminating the need for new infrastructure, loss of data freshness, data movement, and non-Postgres dialects of other query engines.

[### The Alternative Implementation Problem (8 minute read)](https://pointersgonewild.com/2024/04/20/the-alternative-implementation-problem/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Positioning a project as an alternative implementation of something is a losing proposition. Building an alternative implementation means reacting to the whims of the canonical implementation - they have control over the direction of the project and you can only keep up. It's better in most cases to make an original system rather than being chained by expectations to match another implementation.

[### Before launching, GPT-4o broke records on chatbot leaderboard under a secret name (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/before-launching-gpt-4o-broke-records-on-chatbot-leaderboard-under-a-secret-name/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The mysterious chat-topping AI chatbot known as 'gpt2-chatbot' that had been undergoing testing on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena has been revealed to be OpenAI's newly announced GPT-4o model. The model had topped the Chatbot Arena leaderboard, achieving the highest documented score ever. OpenAI tested multiple versions of GPT-4o on Chatbot Arena before its announcement yesterday. The models surpass all other models by a significant gap and have become the strongest ever in the Arena.

[### GameStop, AMC soar more than 70% each as ‚ÄòRoaring Kitty' meme trader resurfaces (5 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/13/gme-jumps-as-trader-roaring-kitty-who-drove-meme-craze-posts-again.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

'Roaring Kitty', the man who inspired the epic short squeeze of 2021, posted online for the first time in roughly three years on Monday, causing GameStop and AMC shares to rally dramatically. The picture he posted of a video gamer leaning forward on their chair garnered 63,000 likes in 13 hours. He later posted a few videos with scenes from popular TV shows and movies, but there is no clear indication of what these posts mean. GameStop's stock has started to move higher recently, which, along with the enormous amount of short interest in the stock, may have rekindled his interest.
