[### Lisa Su Saved AMD. Now She Wants Nvidia's AI Crown (13 minute read)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2023/05/31/lisa-su-saved-amd-now-she-wants-nvidias-ai-crown/?sh=577ec6611ec9?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AMD was floundering when Lisa Su took over as CEO in 2014. Su was able to take advantage of missteps by Intel and signed deals with many large customers, bringing the company out of trouble and even overtaking rival Intel in market capitalization. AMD now plans to produce chips to break Nvidia's near-monopoly on the processors that power generative AI technologies. The company plans to have AI in every one of its products in five years. This article talks about Su's time at AMD and her plans for the company for the next few years.

Seattle-based startup Hubble Network wants to launch a satellite network that any Bluetooth-enabled device from anywhere in the world can connect to. It aims to build out a constellation of 300 satellites to provide real-time updates for any sensor or device with a Bluetooth low-energy chip. Hubble's technology allows radio signals to be detected around 1,000 kilometers away. The company plans to launch an initial batch of four satellites in January 2024.

[### Zapping the brain during sleep helps memories form (3 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/health/memory-consolidation-brain-stimulation?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at UCLA and Tel Aviv University have found a way to improve people's memories by stimulating the brain with gentle electric pulses during sleep. The researchers suspected that the part of the brain where memories are initially stored communicates with another part of the brain during sleep as part of the process of memory consolidation. The study confirmed the communication between the two parts of the brain and demonstrated a way to strengthen the connection. The team is now exploring whether AI can help identify brain activity linked to specific memories.

[### Watch Transitions in Slow Motion in Chromes DevTools (2 minute read)](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/slow-motion-animations-with-chrome-devtools/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chrome's devtools allow developers to watch animations play out in slow motion. This enables easier debugging. Some issues happen too fast and can't be detected without slow motion. To watch animations in slow motion, developers just need to access the console drawer in Chrome devtools and then choose the 'Animations' panel from the 'More' menu. A menu will appear that allows users to set animation speed.
