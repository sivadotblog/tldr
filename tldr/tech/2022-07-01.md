Researchers have developed an implant that can relieve pain on demand without the use of drugs. The device works by wrapping around nerves and delivering targeted cooling via evaporation. A sensor ensures that the cooling doesn't damage any tissue. The device can be remotely activated and users can control its intensity. Cooling nerves numbs them and blocks pain signals to the brain. The device is water-soluble and it is naturally absorbed by the body after use.

[### Improve Git monorepo performance with a file system monitor (22 minute read)](https://github.blog/2022-06-29-improve-git-monorepo-performance-with-a-file-system-monitor/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article discusses the new built-in FSMonitor added in Git version 2.37.0 and how it improves performance on very large worktrees. The Git file system monitor (FSMonitor) feature speeds up commands like git status and git add by reducing the size of the search. These commands are slow as they are searching the entire worktree looking for changes, which can be a problem for very large worktrees. FSMonitor continually watches worktrees to have a complete view of all file system changes.
