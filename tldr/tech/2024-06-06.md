Apple and OpenAI have forged a partnership to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT into iOS. The agreement will be a key focus of Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference next week. The partnership is likely a short- to medium-term relationship for Apple, which is developing its own AI features. Apple is still in talks with Google about using Gemini in its devices. The company is also looking beyond chatbots - it is currently working on a mobile robot that can follow users around and handle chores on their behalf and AI features for its AirPods and cameras.

[### Night-vision lenses so thin and light that we can all see in the dark (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/technology/night-vision-thin-light-lens/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Transformative Meta-Optical Systems (TMOS) in Australia have developed a night-vision film that weighs less than a gram and can be placed across existing lensed frames. The technology captures visible and non-visible light in one image, unlike traditional night-vision systems which capture side-by-side views from each spectrum, resulting in a better-quality view of what's in the dark. It could change the way people work and play after dark. Details about how the tech works are available in the article.

[### Don't fix it just because it's technical debt (2 minute read)](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2023/05/08/dont-fix-it-just-because-its-technical-debt/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Technical debt is when developers make a decision to borrow against their future productivity in order to achieve earlier product delivery, and because of that decision, they must make recurring interest payments in the form of wasted effort. While engineers hate waste, management sees the issue in terms of costs. If there are significant cost savings by spending time reducing wasted effort, then managers will see it as a good investment, otherwise they may think developers should just keep on wasting that effort. Companies exist to make money, not reduce wasted effort.
