Mark Zuckerberg says that Apple's Vision Pro doesn‚Äôt present any major breakthroughs in technology that Meta hadn't already explored and that the two companies had different visions for how people will use their headsets. The Quest aims to have people interacting in new ways and feeling closer while also being active and doing things. Apple's demos for the Vision Pro only show people using the device while sitting alone on a couch. The Quest 3's lower price tag will help the device reach a wider audience.

[### What will GPT-2030 look like? (27 minute read)](https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/what-will-gpt-2030-look-like/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This post looks at the historical rate of progress in machine learning and extrapolates it forward to forecast the properties of large pretrained ML systems in 2030. GPT-2030 will likely be superhuman at various specific tasks and will be able to be copied arbitrarily and run in parallel. Its copies will be able to share knowledge, allowing for rapid parallel learning. The model will accelerate many areas of research but also create serious vectors for misuse.

[### RNA editing helps octopuses cope with the cold (2 minute read)](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rna-editing-octopus-dna-cold-protein?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have known for over a decade that cephalopods are able to edit large amounts of their RNA. A recent study showed that environmental changes can trigger RNA editing. Some octopuses and squids cope with cold water by editing their RNA to change the proteins they produce. Most of the editing occurs in the nervous system, likely to help their brains function as temperatures drop.

[### Understanding GPT tokenizers (5 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jun/8/gpt-tokenizers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Large language models take text, convert it into tokens, then predict which tokens come next. Playing around with tokens is an interesting way to get a better idea of how the technology works. This article explores what tokens are, the different types of tokens that exist, and token quirks. A tool for converting text to tokens, tokens to text, and running searches against the full token table for GPT-2 is available.
