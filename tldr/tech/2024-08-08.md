The launch of GPT-4o sent ChatGPT's revenue soaring - it pulled in $28 million in net revenue from the App Store and Google Play in July.

[### Reddit considers search ads, paywalled content for the future (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/reddit-mulls-showing-ads-in-more-places-paywalled-subreddits/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Reddit's plans for making more money from the platform include showing ads in more places and possibly putting some content behind a paywall. The company, which has never been profitable, lost $10.1 million during Q2 2024, down from Q2 2023's $41.1 million loss. It recently blocked all search engines besides Google, OpenAI, and approved education/research instances from showing its content in search results. Reddit seems to be trying to capitalize on how people use its name as a filter for search results.

NASA has downplayed the problems experienced by Boeing's Starliner since it took two astronauts to the International Space Station in June. Officials finally admitted on Wednesday that the issues may be more serious than first thought and that the astronauts might not return on Starliner. The agency is exploring a backup option for the astronauts. The astronauts were meant to stay for around eight days, but that could be extended into next year.

[### Don't pivot into AI research (3 minute read)](https://maged.com/pivot-to-ai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chip design used to be a high-profile role, with the most famous chip designers viewed similarly to how famous machine learning researchers are seen today. Many students flocked to the industry as the number of chip companies boomed and the field was in demand. However, as market dynamics changed, the supply of hardware engineers grew too high. The high capital costs for chip manufacturing drove the number of employers down to a handful of major chip makers. The field of AI research will likely play out the same way.

[### Google antitrust verdict leaves Apple with ‚Äúinconvenient alternatives‚Äù (7 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/08/google-antitrust-verdict-means-inconvenient-alternatives-for-apple/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple benefited greatly from Google's monopoly. While the Department of Justice has not yet said what it will seek for a remedy to the antitrust case, Apple will likely be deeply involved. Apple could be forced to accept a much less lucrative agreement with Microsoft or may be prevented from selling search defaults at all. Mozilla may also be heavily impacted by the decision - Google's 2021 payment to the company for the default position on its browser was about 80 percent of Mozilla's operating budget.
