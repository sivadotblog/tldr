[### Researchers Just Wirelessly Transmitted Power Over 98 Feet of Thin Air (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-just-wirelessly-transmitted-power-over-98-feet-of-thin-air)

Researchers from South Korea used infrared lasers to transmit 400mW of light power over distances of up to 30 meters. The lasers use the safest part of the infrared spectrum and can't damage human skin or eyes. They fall back to a low power mode when not in use. Laser charging could be useful in environments where electrical connections can cause interference or pose a fire hazard.

[### Physicists Broke The Speed of Light With Pulses Inside Hot Plasma (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-broke-the-speed-of-light-with-pulses-inside-hot-plasma)

Physicists in the US have shown that under certain conditions, waves made up of groups of photons can move faster than light. The researchers changed the group velocity of light pulses sent through plasma, causing the light to slow down or move up to 30% faster. The effect is still well within the laws of physics. The discovery could result in the development of insanely powerful lasers.
