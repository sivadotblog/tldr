[### The start-ups making robots a reality (3 minute read)](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Robotics?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article presents a list of cutting-edge robotics startups and labs that Bill Gates is excited about. The last year has seen advancements in artificial intelligence that have resulted in programs that can create, calculate, process, understand, decide, recognize patterns, and learn in ways that resemble how humans learn. However, many robots still struggle to perform basic human tasks that require dexterity, mobility, and cognition. The applications for robots are almost limitless. While there will be issues with robots taking people's jobs, it's less likely that robots will replace jobs that people love and more likely that they'll be doing work people don't want to do.

[### Can autoimmune diseases be cured? Scientists see hope at last (7 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00169-7?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists are on the cusp of developing therapies to restore immune tolerance in conditions such as diabetes, lupus, and multiple sclerosis. Tolerance refers to the immune system's ability to ignore antigens that belong to the body while appropriately attacking those that don't. Current therapies for these diseases don't always work, and even when they do, the improvement is often modest. Results from studies are starting to show that it is possible to create curative treatments for these diseases. This article looks at several approaches that scientists are looking at to make those treatments a reality.
