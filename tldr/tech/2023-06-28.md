[### Would an OpenAI work assistant put the company in conflict with Microsoft? (2 minute read)](https://www.fastcompany.com/90915483/openai-workplace-assistant-microsoft-copilot?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's plans to market a personalized assistant for work would put it in competition with Microsoft. Microsoft owns an estimated 49% of OpenAI. It is likely that the issue of OpenAI releasing a work assistant was discussed prior to Microsoft's $10 billion investment into OpenAI in January. There is no doubt that OpenAI was planning to enter the enterprise market as it is quite lucrative.

[### Microsoft wants to move Windows fully to the cloud (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/27/23775117/microsoft-windows-11-cloud-consumer-strategy?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An internal Microsoft presentation, revealed as part of the ongoing FTC v. Microsoft hearing, discusses a full Windows operating system streamed from the cloud to any device. Windows 365, a service that streams Windows to devices, has so far been limited to commercial customers. Microsoft has been working on bringing the service to Windows 11. Moving Windows to the cloud would enable improved AI-powered services and allow people to roam freely with their devices.

SpaceX's plans for upgrading its Starship megarocket include changing how the rocket's two stages separate, propulsion system improvements, and a beefed-up launch pad. Elon Musk estimates that there is a 60 percent chance that the next Starship test flight will make it to orbit. It may be some time before SpaceX obtains clearance for its next test flight. This article details the changes that SpaceX will make to Starship.

[### The one-shot drug that keeps on dosing (12 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/the-one-shot-drug-that-keeps-on-dosing/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from Rice University have engineered drug-delivering microparticles that release their contents in timed delays that can span days or even weeks. The injections contain hundreds of tiny microplastic particles that each encapsulate a small dose of a drug. The microplastic particles are made of a polymer that breaks down safely in human bodies. Timing and dosage can be controlled by adjusting the molecular weight of the polymer used for each capsule. A long-active delivery strategy like this will help many people with chronic issues who are unable to follow their prescribed treatments.

Many people append 'Reddit' to their search queries when trying to find helpful resources on specific topics. The tactic lost its effectiveness during the Reddit protest earlier this month as many pages were suddenly inaccessible or unhelpful. Google unveiled a new feature called Perspectives on Monday that will at least partially resolve the issue. Perspectives surfaces discussion forums and videos from social media platforms. The Perspectives tab is available now on mobile web and the Google app in the US.
