### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists pull off quantum teleportation between photons from different quantum dots (5 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/photon-teleportation-quantum-dots?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers in Germany have demonstrated the first transfer of quantum information between photons emitted by two different quantum dots. The work is part of a project to build quantum repeaters that fit into existing fiber networks. Any attempt to read or intercept quantum communications leaves traces, making systems inherently secure. The current setup teleports information with a success rate of slightly above 70%. This could be improved by stabilizing the quantum dots.

When Uber first came onto the scene, it provided an entirely new experience for both drivers and riders that was orthogonal to the taxi market. This let it create a far larger market. Robotaxis could have the same effect. The technology could result in the end of urbanism as living in the suburbs becomes more convenient.

[### Making things true (3 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1990057444253241545.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The most important moments in the history of computing were the introduction of new primitives. The command line enabled composable programs, the GUI gave users direct manipulation, the web linked information together, and smartphones provided sensors and connectivity. Each unlocked ecosystems because they provided new primitives that could be infinitely recombined. AI is a new primitive that allows us to decompose and recompose reality in new ways.

Gemini 3 is designed to bring any idea to life. This guide covers the key features of the Gemini 3 model family and shows readers how to get the most out of it. Gemini 3 Pro uses dynamic thinking by default - for faster, low-latency responses, constrain the model's thinking level to 'low'. There are some differences in the model that developers should be aware of when migrating from Gemini 2.5.
