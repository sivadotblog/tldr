[### Google might already be replacing some Ad sales jobs with AI (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/report-google-ads-restructure-could-replace-some-sales-jobs-with-ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google is restructuring its Ads business because of its new AI tools. The tools remove the need for a lot of work, increasing ad revenue profit margins. A growing number of advertisers are adopting Google's AI tools, eliminating the need for employees who specialize in selling ads for particular Google services. Details about the reorganization are expected to be announced next month.

[### Apple Develops Breakthrough Method for Running LLMs on iPhones (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-ai-researchers-run-llms-iphones/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple researchers have made a key breakthrough in deploying large language models on Apple devices with limited memory by using an innovative flash memory utilization technique. The method uses windowing and row-column bundling to minimize data transfer and maximize flash memory throughput. It allows AI models to run up to five times faster on standard processors and up to 25 times faster on graphics processors. The technology sets the stage for iPhones to run complex AI assistants on-device.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Meet the PHOLED That Is Transforming Displays (5 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/blue-pholed?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Blue phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED) materials will soon become commercially available. PHOLEDs are potentially 100% efficient and don't generate heat. Red and green PHOLEDs have been around for a while, but creating blue PHOLEDs has been a challenge. Blue PHOLEDs will mean a more balanced pixel structure for displays, which could result in higher-resolution displays in the future. A switch to blue PHOLEDs will lead to an approximate 25% gain in efficiency and the reduced heat generation should increase the lifetime of all surrounding electronics. Samsung will most likely be the first company to deploy PHOLEDs.

[### Cancer-fighting CAR-T cells could be made inside body with viral injection (3 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03969-5?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

CAR-T treatment involves removing T cells from a patient, engineering them to target cancer cells, and reintroducing them to the patient's body. It has yielded dramatic recoveries from advanced forms of some blood cancers, but the technology is out of reach for many people due to its cost and difficulty. A new study suggests that the treatment can be administered through an injection of a virus that infects T cells. There are plans to request authorization from the US FDA next year to begin human trials of the technology.
