[### ChatGPT and GPT-4 could get a sweet upgrade this fall (4 minute read)](https://www.androidauthority.com/openai-strawberry-ai-3475682/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is reportedly planning to launch a new AI as part of a chatbot this fall. Codenamed Strawberry, the AI has advanced mathematical reasoning, programming, and other skills that allow it to answer questions on more subjective topics, like marketing strategies. It can be used to generate high-quality synthetic training data for training large language models. The model could help OpenAI obtain the data it needs to train the GPT-4's successor.

[### Elon Musk: Cellular Starlink Will Offer Free Emergency Service to All Phones (4 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/elon-musk-cellular-starlink-will-offer-free-emergency-service-to-all-phones?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX's Starlink system for mobile phones will be free for users connecting to emergency services. The company is currently waiting for approval from the Federal Communications Commission to let it commercially operate its 'direct to cell' Starlink technology. Providing free emergency services access would benefit public safety communications and first responders. There aren't many details about how Starlink's system will work, but it will likely be similar to Apple's Emergency SOS feature for iPhones, which is free for the iPhone 14 and up.

[### SpaceX Polaris launch postponed after helium leak is detected (3 minute read)](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/spacex-polaris-launch-postponed-helium-leak-detected-rcna167168?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission has been delayed until later this week at the earliest due to a helium leak. The mission will send four private citizens (billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, retired Air Force Lt. Col. Scott ‚ÄúKidd‚Äù Poteet, and SpaceX engineers Sarah Gillis and Anna Meno) to space on a mission that will include the first spacewalk carried out by a civilian crew. It was scheduled to lift off early Tuesday. Polaris Dawn is the first of three planned space flights funded and organized by Isaacman and SpaceX.

[### Compute Moonshots: Harnessing New Physics (11 minute read)](https://www.mackenziemorehead.com/compute-moonshots/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Digital computing is reaching relative maturity, with traditional electronics well into the final phase of their S-curve and GPUs in the middle of theirs. The demand for compute is showing no sign of slowing. Next-gen approaches will need to harness entirely different materials systems with more amenable physics. This article looks at some of the possible technologies that may bring the industry to the next level.

[### Predicting the Future of Distributed Systems (21 minute read)](https://blog.colinbreck.com/predicting-the-future-of-distributed-systems/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There are significant changes happening with distributed systems. These changes will influence how systems are operated and how they are programmed. This article shares insights into the changes in transactional and analytical systems, especially around object storage and programming models. There are many possible disruptive technologies, so it is challenging to pick the winners and losers.

[### Vanilla Prime (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/morris/vanilla-prime?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Vanilla Prime is a spiritual successor to VANILLA TODO with no frameworks, no bundlers, and no required dependencies. It aims to provide a simpler, more sustainable way of web development. While it is less ergonomic than a fully integrated framework, it produces websites that are performant, lightweight, independent, hackable (in a good way), and respects users' and the world's resources. Vanilla Prime can be difficult to get into and hard to master, but the outcomes can be incredibly rewarding.

[### Three-quarters of founders in the latest Y Combinator cohort are working on AI startups (3 minute read)](https://sherwood.news/tech/three-quarters-of-founders-in-the-latest-y-combinator-cohort-are-working-on/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Of the 208 startups currently listed in Y Combinator's S24 startup directory, 156 are working on AI-related products. Nearly half of all US venture capital investment went to AI companies last quarter. It is unclear whether Y Combinator is deliberately selecting startups that are working in the space, if more founders are choosing to work in AI, or if startups are just saying that their product is AI-related because they think that's what investors or customers want to hear. Only 33 Y Combinator startups were related to crypto and Web3 in 2022, when the technology was the hottest thing to work on.

[### Uber will win self-driving (5 minute read)](https://manassaloi.com/2024/08/11/uber-self-driving.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While Lyft has been working on innovative features for riders, Uber's focus in the US has been on supply. With self-driving cars, the platform power shift will be in the direction of who controls the demand - most people who own self-driving cars will rent out their cars to the platform that has the most demand for it. Uber will have the most types of vehicles available and more flexibility in terms of how much it can charge. It owns the most demand worldwide today, and self-driving will make it even more dominant.
