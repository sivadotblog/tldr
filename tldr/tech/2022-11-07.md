Starlink will start throttling internet for residential customers who use more than 1TB of Priority Access data per month during peak hours beginning in December. Customers will start each billing cycle with an allocation of Priority Access data for use between 7 AM and 11 PM. Usage outside those hours doesn't count towards the 1TB cap. Customers' data will be deprioritized for the rest of the month if they exceed the cap. Extra Priority Access data can be purchased for 25 cents per GB.

[### Google is testing a new robot that can program itself (3 minute read)](https://www.popsci.com/technology/google-ai-robot-code-as-policies/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google's robotics researchers have developed a robot that can write its own programming code based on natural language instructions. Code as Policies is a coding-specific language model that can come up with probable robot code when given comment-like prompts. The model is still new and limited in what it can do. CaP could eventually allow robots to perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific training.

[### Researchers Spin up Terrifying Hacker Drone That Can 'See Through Walls' With Wifi (3 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/drone-see-through-walls-wifi-wi-peep-waterloo-research-1849744061?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from the University of Ontario have created a drone that can triangulate the location of every Wi-Fi-connected device in a house. The Wi-Peep exploits security deficiencies in IEEE 802.11, a longstanding wireless protocol, to measure the distance between a signal and an object. All smart devices are primed to respond to contact attempts even if the network is secured. The researchers hope that their work leads to better protections for Wi-Fi protocols.
