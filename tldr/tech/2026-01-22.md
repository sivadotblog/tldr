[### Apple Developing AirTag-Sized AI Pin With Dual Cameras (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/apple-ai-pin/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is reportedly working on a small, wearable AI pin equipped with multiple cameras, a speaker, and microphones. It will likely run the new Siri chatbot the company plans to unveil in iOS 27. Apple wants the final version of the pin to be about the same size as an AirTag but slightly thicker. The AI pin could be released as soon as 2027, but development is still in the early stages, and the product could be canceled.

[### Apple to Revamp Siri as a Built-In iPhone, Mac Chatbot to Fend Off OpenAI (11 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2OTA2NTIwNywiZXhwIjoxNzY5NjcwMDA3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOFRXOVlLR0NURlUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIwOThFNzNDQTE5QTA0RDkxODEyQzQ4MjcwRDZERTI0QiJ9.35AAN9Cm8PRIKMV_omaP3BVc-q2HuZ6qU64bE-JVPDI&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple plans to revamp Siri later this year by turning it into an AI chatbot. The chatbot will be embedded deeply into the company's operating systems and replace the current Siri interface. The feature is a central piece of Apple's AI strategy. Apple has designed the chatbot so that its underlying models can be swapped out over time. The company will initially use Google-powered systems.

[### Operating on DNA is more like surgery than medicine (11 minute read)](https://www.a16z.news/p/operating-on-dna-is-more-like-surgery?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Last February, a team of doctors and scientists treated a baby with severe CPS1 deficiency, a condition caused by a rare single-gene mutation that causes patients' blood to be flooded with ammonia that the liver can't clear. The doctors sequenced the baby's DNA, designed a custom gene editor to fix the typo in his CPS1 gene, manufactured it on demand, and infused it into his bloodstream. The process took about six months and cost less than $1 million. Today, the baby is thriving and seemingly cured.

[### Designing AI-resistant technical evaluations (18 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/AI-resistant-technical-evaluations?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Evaluating technical candidates is becoming harder as AI capabilities improve. Each new model forces companies to redesign tests. This post describes one company's original take-home design, how each Claude model defeated it, and the increasingly unusual approaches the company has had to take to ensure its tests stay ahead of top models' capabilities. As work evolves alongside models, companies need to develop increasingly creative ways to find strong engineers.

[### The For You page is killing Social (11 minute read)](https://murmurationstwo.substack.com/p/the-for-you-page-is-killing-social?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

X is struggling with two incompatible goals: optimizing attention and time spent on the platform, and tight creator-follow linkage. So far, X has opted to chase KPIs like user time spent on the platform. This has resulted in creators unable to consistently reach their audience, consumers not hearing from creators they want to follow, and filter bubbles like Crypto Twitter. Either creators and users are tightly linked, or the platform algorithmically serves users an array of compelling content - you can't have both.

[### Why Elon Musk Is Racing to Take SpaceX Public (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/why-elon-musk-is-racing-to-take-spacex-public-38f3de9b?st=18PqmA&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The rush to build AI data centers prompted Elon Musk to propose putting them in space. Musk has become obsessed with the idea of SpaceX being the first to do it, but such a feat would be hard to attempt and would require the billions of dollars in capital an initial public offering could deliver. A SpaceX IPO could also help xAI catch up to rivals. SpaceX is expected to collect banks to lead the stock offering soon, with the IPO expected to be completed by July.
