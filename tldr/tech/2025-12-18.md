Sebastian Seung, a neuroscience and computer science professor at Princeton University, was one of the researchers who helped create the first complete wiring diagram of a fly's brain. He has created a startup called Memazing to create the technology needed to reverse engineer the fly brain (and eventually more complex organisms) and create full recreations of the brain in software. The company's goal is to use an existing map of how nature has produced intelligence to create a new form of artificial intelligence. The startup is still in a very early stage and is in the process of raising funds, but the team has already begun work on the fly brain emulation and has started connecting a model to a simple robotics system.
