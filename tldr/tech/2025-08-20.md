US companies have invested between $35 to $40 billion in generative AI initiatives, and so far have almost nothing to show for it. Only 5% of organizations have successfully integrated AI tools into production at scale. Confidence in AI initiatives is declining among corporate leaders. The divide is due to the inability of AI systems to retain data, adapt, and learn over time, rather than insufficient infrastructure, learning, or talent.
