[### YouTube tests disabling videos for people using ad blockers (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/29/23778879/youtube-videos-disabling-ad-blockers-detection?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

YouTube is running a small global experiment that prompts users with ad blockers to allow ads or try YouTube Premium. Some users have reported that video playback is being cut off after viewing more than three videos when an ad blocker is active. YouTube says that users will receive multiple warnings before playback is disrupted. Users can dispute their bans if they feel that they have been falsely flagged as using an ad blocker.

[### Reddit is telling protesting mods their communities will not stay private (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/28/23777195/reddit-protesting-moderators-communities-subreddits-private-reopen?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Reddit has given its moderators deadlines to lay out plans for reopening. Subreddits will not be allowed to remain closed. The company claims that moderators are violating the Moderator Code of Conduct, which says that they need to be active and engaged.

It currently has a backlog of about 800 passengers, many who bought tickets for between $200,000 to $250,000 over a decade ago.

[### Welcome to Fusion City, USA (7 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/fusion?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A prototype reactor in Everett, WA is already producing high-energy neutrons from nuclear fusion. Zap Energy's Fuze-Q prototype, which is an office-desk-sized device, is designed to reliably produce enough power for 30,000 homes all day and night, year-round. The system has no cryogenics, no superconducting coils, no auxiliary heating, and no magnets. Zap believes that gargantuan systems are unnecessary, undesirable, and impractical for fusion power. The company is betting that it will be easier to produce practical amounts of power by stringing together short pulses of fusion activity rather than trying to create a continuous fusion reaction.
