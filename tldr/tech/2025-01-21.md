### Big Tech & Startups

[### All the rumors about the iPhone Air (5 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24344710/apple-iphone-17-air-rumors-specs-display-size-price?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The iPhone Air may mark the biggest design shift for the line in many years. Rumors suggest that the super-thin iPhone will debut as part of the iPhone 17 lineup this fall. There are enough rumors to infer that something real is in the works. This article rounds up all of the current rumors about the upcoming device, which will sacrifice some function for a sleeker, slimmer design. Apple is likely using the device as a testing ground for new technologies, including its in-house wireless and cell modem chips and the smaller tech needed to eventually build a folding iPhone.

[### The 850 billion reasons Apple and others aren't taking a chance on TikTok (3 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/20/the-850-billion-reasons-apple-and-others-arent-taking-a-chance-on-tiktok/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

TikTok has been removed from app stores in the US despite the Biden administration issuing a statement that it didn't intend to try to enforce the law and Trump saying there would be no liability for ignoring the law while he tries to suspend the ban. The law allows for app stores to be fined $5,000 per user, which would be a massive blow even for a company of Apple's size. It is not clear whether Trump has the power to shield companies from this liability. The providers that have resumed service for TikTok are rapidly accruing tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars of liability.

[### OpenAI's agent tool may be nearing release (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/openais-agent-tool-may-be-nearing-release/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A software engineer claims to have uncovered evidence of OpenAI's long-rumored Operator, an AI tool that can take control of users' PCs and perform actions on their behalf. OpenAI may be releasing the tool this month. The company's site and apps now contain hidden references to Operator. While AI agents are risky and speculative, tech giants are already touting them as the next big thing in AI. Analysts say the market for AI agents could be worth $47.1 billion by 2030.

Beijing is holding a marathon for humans and robots in its Daxing district in April. Around 12,000 humans will run alongside robots from more than 20 companies at the event. Prizes will be offered to the top three runners. China is ramping up efforts to develop artificial intelligence and robotics to gain an edge in its tech rivalry with the US and combat the challenges of an aging society and a falling birth rate.

[### The Making of Community Notes (40 minute read)](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/08/the-making-of-community-notes?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article contains an interview with the team that built X's Community Notes feature where they discuss the design process and the philosophy behind their approach to combating false information on the platform. The idea for Community Notes started around the end of 2019 with the observation that people wanted to get accurate information on social media while there was obvious misinformation going around. The main approaches that were used by other companies at the time were slow, didn't scale well, and suffered from a fundamental trust problem - people don't want a tech company deciding what is true. Wikipedia showed that crowdsourcing was a potential solution space, and follow-up studies by the team confirmed the idea was worth implementing.
