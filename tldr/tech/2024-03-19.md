[### Apple‚Äôs AI ambitions could include Google or OpenAI (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104626/apple-license-google-gemini-generative-ai-openai-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is reportedly actively negotiating with Google to bring Gemini's generative AI technology to iOS. The company is aiming to release AI features to customers later this year. These features will likely be powered by a mix of first- and third-party AI models. While Apple has been testing its own in-house models, its AI tech is said to be less advanced than the competition.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### A cargo ship‚Äôs ‚ÄòWindWing‚Äô sails saved it up to 12 tons of fuel per day (3 minute read)](https://www.popsci.com/technology/windwing-ship-sails/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Pyxis Ocean MC Shipping Kamsarmax vessel features a pair of 123-feet-tall solid 'wings' on top of its deck to harness wind power for propulsion assistance. After six months of operation, results from its journeys show that the technology offers a promising way to reduce existing vessels' emissions. The ship reportedly saved an average of 3.3 tons of fuel each day - it saved over 12 tons a day during optimal weather conditions. One potential issue with the adoption of the technology is the extra 125 feet of height added by the wings as they could complicate docking in many locations.

[### A month of the Vision Pro (11 minute read)](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/3/17/a-month-of-the-vision-pro?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AR/VR/MR technology still hasn't reached the mass market yet - it is still at the beginning of the S-Curve. The components in the Vision Pro are still years away from fitting into a Quest 3's size, weight, and price. The Vision Pro is effectively a very polished prototype or a developer kit rather than a consumer product. While it is an impressive piece of technology, there's not much that people can do with it. The future of computing probably isn't more or bigger screens. It may take a few years before the technology really takes off.
