[### Scientists make embryos from human skin DNA for first time (6 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2vyee0zlo?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at the Oregon Health and Science University have created early-stage human embryos by manipulating DNA taken from people's skin cells, then fertilizing them with sperm. The technology could overcome infertility due to old age or disease. It could even allow same-sex couples to have a genetically related child. The technique still needs significant refinement before a fertility clinic could even consider using it, which could take a decade.

[### Examples are the best documentation (2 minute read)](https://rakhim.exotext.com/examples-are-the-best-documentation?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Technical documentation is mostly aimed at people deeply immersed in the ecosystem. However, many developers have to juggle a lot of 'worlds' in their heads daily. It takes a lot of mental energy to restore context and understand what is going on when jumping between projects, languages, and frameworks. Examples are great because a lot of developers look at docs simply because they need to quickly find out how to do something. Tutorials are often helpful, not because of the walkthrough, but because they contain examples.

Amazon's hardware division has long been seen as a loss leader. The company makes its profits from subscriptions and purchases made through the Alexa voice assistant. Some product lines are now profitable, and others are heading in that direction. The company's recently revamped devices have higher prices, and they're much better products. For the company to become a true leader in devices, it will need breakthroughs that go beyond its current lineup.
