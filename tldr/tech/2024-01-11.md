Software engineering has been seen as one of the safest havens in the American job market for much of the 21st century.

[### Does DNA have the equivalent of IF-statements, WHILE loops, or function calls? How about GOTO? (8 minute read)](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/30116/does-dna-have-the-equivalent-of-if-statements-while-loops-or-function-calls-h?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While DNA is not analogous to computer code, biological systems have some pathways that operate in similar ways to computers. 'If' statements are similar to transcriptional activators, transcriptional repressors can act as 'while' statements, and there are codes that make other sections dispensable, kind of like a GOTO statement. There are no equivalents of function calls as all events happen in the same space and there is always a likelihood of interference.
