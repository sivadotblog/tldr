Manual testing on personal devices is too slow and too limited. It forces teams to cut releases a week early just to test before submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage, issues slip through.

[### Perplexity teases a web browser called Comet (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/perplexity-teases-a-web-browser-called-comet/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine company, has launched a sign-up list for its upcoming browser, Comet. There are few details on what the browser will do or what it looks like, but the company calls it 'a browser for agentic search'. Perplexity's product portfolio is growing at a rapid pace - it recently released a 'deep research' product, an AI-powered assistant for Android, and an API for AI search. It has reportedly raised over $500 million in capital from VCs and is said to be valued at $9 billion.

[### Anthropic launches a new AI model that ‚Äòthinks' as long as you want (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/anthropic-launches-a-new-ai-model-that-thinks-as-long-as-you-want/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model is designed to 'think' about questions for as long as users want it to. It can give both real-time answers and more considered, thought-out answers to questions. The model is rolling out to all users and developers, but only premium users will have access to its reasoning features. It will cost $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, making it more expensive than OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek's R1.

Lunar Trailblazer is set to begin its two year mission when it is blasted into space on a SpaceX Falcon rocket on Thursday. The probe's goal is to seek out water on the lunar surface. Scientists have recently uncovered strong hints that there are significant quantities of water on the surface of the moon. This water could potentially be turned into hydrogen to be used as fuel and oxygen for humans to breathe.

[### SpaceX targeting Friday for next test of Starship megarocket (2 minute read)](https://phys.org/news/2025-02-spacex-friday-starship-megarocket.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX is targeting a launch window that opens at 5:30 PM on Friday for its next Starship megarocket test flight, pending regulatory approval. The previous test flight ended with Starship's upper stage disintegrating, prompting cleanup and recovery efforts for fallen debris. SpaceX has implemented numerous upgrades to the upper stage for the upcoming flight to enhance reliability and performance. The mission is expected to last just over an hour and will include another attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower.

[### JSON has become today's machine-readable output format on Unix (2 minute read)](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/JSONModernMachineReadableFormat?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

JSON has a bunch of pragmatic virtues in a modern UNIX system. It provides a clear and basically unambiguous way to represent text and most numeric data, and it's also generally extensible. There are increasingly more tools to deal with and process JSON and it can generally be transformed to various other formats if needed. Designing a machine-readable output format is somewhat more complicated than it looks - using JSON means that people writing programs don't have to design their own formats.

[### Claude Code Research Preview (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives inside the terminal. It understands code bases and helps developers code faster by executing routine tasks, explaining complex code, and handling git workflows, all through natural language commands. Claude Code can edit files, fix bugs, execute and fix tests, search through git history, resolve merge conflicts, create commits and PRs, and more.

[### Apple exec Phil Schiller testifies that he raised concerns over App Store commissions on web-based sales (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/apple-exec-phil-schiller-testifies-that-he-raised-concerns-over-app-store-commissions-on-web-based-sales/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Phil Schiller, the executive in charge of leading Apple's App Store, testified in court that he had originally raised concerns about the 27% commission that Apple planned to charge app developers on purchases made outside the App Store. He had claimed that it would be a potential compliance risk and that the fee would create an antagonistic relationship between Apple and developers. It would also require Apple to have audit rights to check whether companies owe Apple money for transactions that took place outside the App Store. Apple's pricing committee ultimately decided to charge the commission despite Schiller's concerns.
