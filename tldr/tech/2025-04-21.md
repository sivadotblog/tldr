Manual testing on personal devices is too slow and too limited. It forces teams to cut releases a week early just to test before submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage, issues slip through.

[### Inside OpenAI's Controversial Plan to Abandon its Nonprofit Roots (21 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SHbEEFHqTuoveZcLr/inside-openai-s-controversial-plan-to-abandon-its-nonprofit?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is currently a $300 billion for-profit company governed by a nonprofit board. Investors began demanding that the company shed its quasi-nonprofit status after Sam Altman was fired in November 2023. The company has been trying to balance the desire to raise capital and build the tech and stay true to its mission since its beginning, but the latest move is an attempt to separate these things. This article discusses the hurdles that OpenAI has had to overcome to make the transition a reality. OpenAI's board will decide on the company's future and evolve the OpenAI nonprofit well before the end of 2025.

[### Uncovered emails showed how Meta struggled to keep Facebook culturally relevant (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/uncovered-emails-showed-how-meta-struggled-to-keep-facebook-culturally-relevant/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta was aware that its cultural relevance was decreasing back in 2022. A series of messages from April 2022 showed how Mark Zuckerberg had concerns about Facebook's 'Friends' structure and format being outdated as every other major platform focused on 'Following'. He had considered ditching the Friends format and even suggested deleting everyone's Facebook friends and having them start again. This article contains some of the highlights from Zuckerberg's emails.

[### China Fires Up World's First Thorium-Powered Nuclear Reactor (3 minute read)](https://futurism.com/china-thorium-nuclear-power?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China's Gobi Desert reactor, a two-megawatt research unit engineered to use molten salt as a fuel carrier and coolant, achieved 'full-power operation' last June and its team recently succeeded in reloading the reactor while it was powered up. The Thorium-powered reactor design offers a more accessible but less weaponizable alternative to uranium. Using molten salt carries far less risk in the event of a meltdown compared to water-based systems as salts can carry greater loads of thermal energy at much lower pressure. The fuel is already molten - in the event of a breach of a vessel or pipe, it will just leak out and freeze rather than explode.

[### Man Versus Machine as China Shows Off Humanoid Robots in Half-Marathon (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/man-versus-machine-as-china-shows-off-humanoid-robots-in-half-marathon-75d7e766?st=WTaUqg&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A half-marathon featuring 21 Chinese humanoid robot models was held in Beijing on Saturday. The 13-mile race was a chance for the country to show off the latest state of its humanoids. China wants to be a world leader in humanoid robots by 2027 - its authorities have lavished support such as subsidies, talent bonuses, and tax breaks on robotics companies. The first robot finished the race after two hours, 40 minutes, and 42 seconds - the human champion completed the race in one hour, two minutes, and 36 seconds.

[### Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding (30 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Claude Code is a command-line tool for agentic coding that gives engineers and researchers a more native way to integrate Claude into their coding workflows. It is intentionally low-level and unopinionated to provide close to raw model access without forcing specific workflows. Claude Code is a flexible, customizable, scriptable, and safe power tool. This post outlines general patterns for engineers using Claude Code across various code bases, languages, and environments.

[### Vibe Coding is not an excuse for low-quality work (21 minute read)](https://addyo.substack.com/p/vibe-coding-is-not-an-excuse-for?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While AI-assisted coding can be a game-changer, speed means nothing if developers end up building unmaintainable software. It can be downright dangerous to accept AI-generated output at face value - unchecked AI-generated code can massively amplify technical debt. Many early vibe-coded projects look good on the surface but hide a minefield of issues. Context, scrutiny, and expertise are required to discern the good from the bad - the hype of 'AI magic' needs to meet the reality of software engineering principles.

[### OpenAI, Windsurf, and the future of work (3 minute read)](https://subtle.so/openai-windsurf-and-the-future-of-ai-workspaces.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cursor and Windsurf aren't just good developer tools, they could potentially become the AI-powered workspaces of the future. OpenAI might want Windsurf because of the usage data from users interacting with models, which could help the company's models catch up to Anthropic's on coding benchmarks. The competitive landscape is now getting messy - Microsoft (which makes VS Code) is now directly competing with Cursor and Windsurf (based on VS Code) through GitHub Copilot's new agent mode, but it is heavily invested in OpenAI, which is invested in Cursor and is now buying its biggest competitor.

[### A New Frontier in Heart Disease: Could We Eradicate Coronary Artery Disease? (3 minute read)](https://x.com/ronkarlsbergmd/status/1896818568454410506?s=12&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, genetic profiling, and personalized therapies offer a pathway to rethinking how coronary artery disease (CAD) is addressed. Efforts over the past few decades have focused on risk factors like high LDL, smoking, or diabetes as proxies for CAD, but these often sidestep the core issue of atherosclerotic plaque buildup in the arteries. Plaque type, volume, and progress are details that predict heart attack risk more precisely than cholesterol levels alone. New approaches are using imaging enhanced by AI to detect plaque and then implementing gene-slicing techniques to neutralize genetic risks while lifestyle and medications tackle environmental factors. While cost and accessibility pose real questions to scaling these therapies, there is evidence that suggests feasibility.
