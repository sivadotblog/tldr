[### Apple buys every 3 nm chip that TSMC can make for next-gen iPhones and Macs (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/report-apple-is-saving-billions-on-chips-thanks-to-unique-deal-with-tsmc/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple was by far TSMC's largest customer in 2022. The company has reportedly bought up all of TSMC's 3 nm manufacturing capacity for roughly a year. The deal has apparently been in place since 2014 when Apple started using TSMC's factories. Part of the deal involves TSMC eating the cost of defective processor dies, chips that don't work or don't perform to the required specifications, which can result in substantial savings for Apple.
