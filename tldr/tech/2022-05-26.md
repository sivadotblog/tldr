[### CRISPR tomatoes genetically engineered to be richer in vitamin D (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/science/tomatoes-crispr-genetic-engineering-vitamin-d/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at the John Innes Center have genetically engineered tomatoes to provide a new source of vitamin D. Tomato leaves contain very low levels of a vitamin D precursor. The researchers used CRISPR technology to switch off a specific enzyme that normally converts the precursor into other molecules, which allowed the precursor to accumulate in the flesh, peel, and leaves at much higher levels. This resulted in tomatoes that contained as much vitamin D as two eggs. The technique could be used in other plants, like aubergines or potatoes, as they have similar biochemical pathways.

[### Zoo Saving DNA From Rare Animals In Case They Go Extinct (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/the-byte/zoo-animal-dna-extinction?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

England's Chester Zoo and a tissue bank called Nature's SAFE have partnered up to cryogenically freeze genetic material from animals that pass away at the zoo. The preserved material could save species from extinction in the future. Small tissue samples will be taken from animals and cryogenically frozen at temperatures of -320.8 Fahrenheit using liquid nitrogen. The technology will provide a safeguard for many animals that are currently going extinct.
