[### Restoring Hearing With Beams of Light (13 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cochlear-implant?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many people with cochlear implants report that voices sound flat and robotic and that background noises blur together. A team of scientists in Germany is looking to improve the technology by using light emitters and genetically altered cells that respond to light. The optical cochlear implants can better replicate the full spectral nature of sounds and better mimic natural hearing. The team aims to start clinical trials in 2026.

[### Artificial Muscles Woven Into Smart Textiles Could Make Clothing Hyperfunctional (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/smart-clothes-artificial-muscles?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Engineers from Australia have developed a new class of fluid-driven smart textiles that can shape-shift into 3D structures. They are made up of long, fluid-filled silicone tubes that can be manipulated through hydraulic pressure. This gives the textiles the ability to expand or contract depending on the hydraulic pressure. The artificial muscles can be mass-produced at any scale and size. The technology has potential applications in soft robotics and smart garments.

Facebook has rolled out the changes quickly on mobile and will update Facebook for computer/browser users later in the year. It will continue to provide a chronologically ordered friends-and-family feed via a subsidiary tab. The changes herald the end of an era where social networks served as most users' primary experience of the internet.
