[### Kuo: iPhone 15 to Switch From Lightning to USB-C in 2023 (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/11/iphone-15-ditch-lightning-for-usb-c/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The iPhone 15 lineup will launch in the second half of 2023 and will feature a USB-C port, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Apple has kept the Lightning port on the iPhone, despite most of the industry moving to USB-C. Pressure from the EU has forced Apple to change its stance. Apple may have had plans to keep the Lightning port on the iPhone until it was ready to go entirely port-less. Most of its iPad lineup already features USB-C.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Samsung and LG preview the future of weird phone displays (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23066618/lg-samsung-display-foldable-smartphones-360-degree-hinge-dual-fold?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Samsung and LG showed off new folding screen technologies during the annual Display Week conference this week. LG Display had an 8-inch foldable touchscreen that can fold both inwards and outwards. The 360-degree Foldable OLED can survive being folded over 200,000 times. Samsung Display showed off a display that can fold twice in the same direction and another that can fold once inwards and once outwards. It also had displays that can unfurl horizontally or vertically. Videos showing what the displays look like are available in the article.

[### Old Mice 'Rejuvenated' With Injections of Brain Fluid From The Young (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-rejuvenate-the-memories-of-elderly-mice-by-injecting-them-with-young-mouse-cerebrospinal-fluid?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new study has found links between memory and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in mice. The study found that older mice that were injected with CSF from younger mice had improved memory. CSF composition changes with age and these changes are used to assess brain health and disease biomarkers. The study found that CSF from younger mice resulted in brain cells producing more myelin, a material that covers and insulates neuron fibers, in the hippocampus, an area of the brain associated with memory formation. There is still a lot of research to be done before the technique can be tested in humans.
