It is the second time in eight months that Google has been labeled an illegal monopolist. The company could be forced to sell some of its advertising products. Google plans to appeal the ruling.

[### Musk's SpaceX is frontrunner to build Trump's Golden Dome missile shield (6 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/musks-spacex-is-frontrunner-build-trumps-golden-dome-missile-shield-2025-04-17/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX and two partners, Anduril and Palantir, are frontrunners in a race to win a crucial part of President Trump's Golden Dome missile defense shield. They have proposed a constellation of 400 to more than 1,000 missile defense satellites and a subscription model for missile defense. Trump has cited a missile attack as the most catastrophic threat facing the US. The decision process for the Golden Dome is in its early stages and its ultimate structure and who is selected to work on it could change drastically in the coming months.

[### World's first "nonstop beating heart" transplant is a medical breakthrough (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/heart-disease/heartbeat-transplant-ntuh/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Surgeons at the National Taiwan University Hospital have performed a heart transplant during which the donor's heart continued beating between the organ removal and transplantation stages. Donor hearts are usually removed and preserved in cold storage, which can damage muscle tissue, reducing function and health once transplanted. The operation was possible due to a specially designed organ maintenance system that kept the donor heart pumping with oxygenated blood throughout the process. Followup appointments with the patient showed that they maintain a low level of cardiac enzyme, something that usually spikes during typical transplant conditions.

[### Daily Pill May Work as Well as Ozempic for Weight Loss and Blood Sugar (8 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/health/pill-glp-1-eli-lilly.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Ak8.5SW9._U3at47ATy9-&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Orforglipron is a daily pill by Eli Lilly that may be as effective in lowering blood sugar and aiding weight loss in people with Type 2 diabetes as Ozempic. It is part of the GLP-1 class of drugs that have become famous for their weight-loss effects. While the pill is still expected to be expensive, it has the potential to become far more widely used than current GLP-1s, which must be kept refrigerated and must be injected. Eli Lilly will seek approval from the FDA later this year to market the drug for obesity and early in 2026 for diabetes.

[### A practical guide to building agents (40 minute read)](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Agents are AI systems that can perform workflows on users' behalf with a high degree of independence. This guide, designed for product and engineering teams, explores how to build agents with frameworks for identifying promise use cases, clear patterns for designing agent logic and orchestration, and best practices to ensure agents run safely, predictably, and effectively. It provides the foundational knowledge needed to confidently start building agents. Building reliable agents means starting with strong foundations - start small, validate with real users, and grow capabilities over time.

[### OpenAI launches Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/openai-launches-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's Flex processing is a new API option that provides lower AI model usage prices in exchange for slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. It is available in beta for the company's recently released o3 and o4-mini reasoning models. Aimed at lower-priority and non-production tasks, the feature reduces API costs by exactly half. In the email announcing the launch of Flex processing, OpenAI also indicated that developers in tiers 1 to 3 of its usage tiers hierarchy will have to complete ID verification to access o3.

[### The Second Half (11 minute read)](https://ysymyth.github.io/The-Second-Half/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The AI industry is now shifting its focus from solving problems to defining problems. Evaluation is becoming more important than training - people are now looking at how to measure real progress. A shift in mindset and skill set is required to thrive in this new era. Players in the game can now build billion- or trillion-dollar companies by making useful products out of intelligence.

[### At Meta Trial, Sheryl Sandberg Defends Tactics With Rivals (7 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/technology/zuckerberg-meta-antitrust-trial.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Ak8.sMQY.8faQqiNkCde6&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Lawyers for the FTC pressed Sheryl Sandberg, who was second in command at Meta from 2008 to 2022, on the witness stand on Wednesday during the company's landmark antitrust trial. She was asked to explain an email chain in which executives disallowed Google+ from advertising with the company. She said that it was a scary time for the company and that Google's new tool was being promoted on its main search page. The FTC's volume of internal communication evidence is compelling as it shows that Mark Zuckerberg had an interest in buying a competitor.
