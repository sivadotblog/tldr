SpaceX is set to conduct a wet dress rehearsal of the Starship launch system from its Starbase site in southeastern Texas. A wet dress rehearsal is a series of prelaunch tests that includes propellant loading of both the upper stage and booster and a run-through of the countdown to just before engine ignition. If it is successful, then the next steps would be a separation of the Starship second stage and Super Heavy booster followed by a full static fire test. These tests take just a few weeks, so it is possible an orbital flight test could be conducted in March.
