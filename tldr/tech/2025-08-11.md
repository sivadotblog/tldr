[### Alexa Got an A.I. Brain Transplant. How Smart Is It Now? (10 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/09/business/alexa-artificial-intelligence-amazon.html?unlocked_article_code=1.dU8.mapx.vy_6-4U6vKcv&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Alexa+ is a remodel of Alexa that aims to marry the conversational skills of generative AI chatbots with the daily tasks the old Alexa did well. It is now being rolled out widely after being in a testing program for a few months. While the new Alexa is more fun to talk to and has some new capabilities, it is still too buggy and unreliable. It lags behind voice models that other companies provide, and it is noticeably worse than the original Alexa at some basic tasks.

[### Tesla Robotaxi scores permit to run ride-hailing service in Texas (4 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/08/tesla-robotaxi-scores-permit-to-run-ride-hailing-service-in-texas.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla has obtained a permit to run a ride-hailing business in Texas. Elon Musk said on Tesla's earnings call last month that he believes Tesla could serve half the US population by the end of the year with autonomous ride-hailing services. Tesla's autonomous vehicle efforts have faced a number of challenges across the country, including federal probes, product liability lawsuits, and recalls following injurious or damaging collisions. The company currently lags way behind competitors in the robotaxi market, like Alphabet's Waymo in the US and Baidu's Apollo Go in China.

[### Butter made from carbon tastes like the real thing, gets backing from Bill Gates (3 minute read)](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/butter-carbon-bill-gates-batavia-illinois/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Savor, a company in Batavia, Illinois, makes butter from carbon and hydrogen with no agriculture whatsoever. The butter looks, smells, and tastes like real butter but without the farmland, fertilizer, or emissions tied to the typical process. The company expects its products to be available on shelves for the average consumer by around 2027. Savor is backed by billionaire Bill Gates, who says lab-made fats and oils have an immense potential to significantly reduce humans' carbon footprint.

[### Diabetic Man With Gene-Edited Cells Produces His Own Insulin‚ÄîNo Transplant Drugs Required (4 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/diabetic-man-with-gene-edited-cells-produces-his-own-insulin-no-transplant-drugs-required-2000640127?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists in Sweden and the US have helped a 42-year-old man with long-standing diabetes make his own insulin using gene-edited pancreatic cells. The patient was given donated islet cells that were genetically modified using CRISPR to prevent immune rejection. Donated islet cell transplants seem to be able to provide a self-sustained replacement supply of insulin for type 1 diabetics, but these transplants require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to ensure the host's body doesn't attack the donated cells. The study, while preliminary, suggests that it is possible to avoid provoking an immune response.
