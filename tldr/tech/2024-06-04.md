Instagram is testing unskippable ads. The ads display a countdown timer and stop users from being able to browse through more content on the app until they view the ad. Instagram has shifted over the years to become more of a video-sharing network, so it makes sense that it is considering becoming more like YouTube. The majority of reactions to the feature have been negative.

[### Seeing Like a Data Structure (33 minute read)](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/seeing-data-structure?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Technology has become entangled with the structure of society and we can no longer see the world around us without it. Our data-centric way of seeing the world isn't serving us well. Tools are controlled by human users, whereas machines only do what their designers want. Technologists should build tools rather than machines. Seeing like a data structure is a choice and there are different paths we can take.

[### The End of Software (3 minute read)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/103cGe8qixC7ZzFsRu5Ww2VEW5YgH9zQaiaqbBsZ1lcc/edit?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Media behaved very differently before the internet. It was expensive to create and distribute. The internet reduced the cost of creating content to zero, allowing a lot of user generated content to be created as creating content didn't cost anything anymore. Content behaved differently once it no longer had to make money. Software is expensive because developers are expensive. Large language models could drive the cost of creating software to zero - this will likely result in a Cambrian explosion of software, similar to what happened with content.
