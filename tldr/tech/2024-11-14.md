[### OpenAI Nears Launch of AI Agent Tool to Automate Tasks for Users (2 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/openai-nears-launch-of-ai-agents-to-automate-tasks-for-users?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczMTU1NDM2NCwiZXhwIjoxNzMyMTU5MTY0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTTVdOQURUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.LanxngVUwVvF7RKjk31Prvrnwyt061I91JYxaFa4llA&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI agent codenamed 'Operator' that will be able to use a computer to take actions on users' behalf. It plans to release the tool as a research preview in January. OpenAI has been working on several agent-related research projects. The one nearest to completion is a general-purpose tool that executes tasks in a web browser. OpenAI and its competitors are moving towards agents as they are seeing diminishing returns from their costly efforts to develop more advanced AI models.

[### Superhuman vision lets robots see through walls, smoke with new LiDAR-like eyes (5 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/superhuman-vision-lets-robots-see-through-walls-smoke?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

PanoRadar is a system created by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania that converts basic radio waves into rich 3D views, allowing robots to see beyond traditional sensor limits. The device processes radio waves using AI algorithms, making it possible for robots to precisely navigate through challenging situations and obstructions where conventional sensors are inadequate. PanoRadar could be used to complement existing sensing technologies to develop more reliable multi-modal perception systems for robots. A video explaining how the technology works is available in the article.

[### New study on moons of Uranus raises chance of life (6 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgk1333k0ypo?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Uranus and its five biggest moons may have oceans - the moons may even be capable of supporting life. Much of what we know about the planet and its moons was gathered by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft, which visited nearly 40 years ago, apparently on a bad day. New research shows that Voyager 2 flew past during a solar storm, which temporarily distorted the magnetic field and gave us an incorrect view of what Uranus and its moons are normally like. NASA has plans to launch a new mission to go back for a closer look. It is expected to arrive by 2045 and inform scientists about whether the moons have the possibility of being home to life.

[### Will we care about frameworks in the future? (3 minute read)](https://paul.kinlan.me/will-we-care-about-frameworks-in-the-future/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Frameworks are abstractions over a platform designed for people and teams to accelerate work and maintenance while improving the consistency and quality of projects. They frequently force a certain type of structure and architecture. Software development is radically shifting to a world where a person never actually has to manipulate code directly anymore. AI doesn't care about shared logic, extensibility, or inheritability of components - it just implements what it needs. Frameworks may become obsolete in the future unless new patterns of software architecture that work with AI are created.

B2C billing is often underestimated because it feels like a solved problem. Choosing a billing system is a business-critical decision that can have wide-reaching impacts on flexibility, compliance, and customer retention. It may be tempting to build a custom solution, but most companies are better off choosing an existing solution as they cover most common billing challenges.

The FBI has seized the phone of Polymarket's founder and CEO Shayne Coplan. Federal agents raided Coplan's Manhattan home early Wednesday morning. It is unclear what prompted the FBI's search. A Polymarket spokesperson claims that the raid is an act of obvious political retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential election.
