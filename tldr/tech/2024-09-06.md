[### Telegram's Founder, in First Comments Since Arrest, Defends the App (3 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/technology/telegram-pavel-durov-comments.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Ik4.6m3h.aUbHbs1TnvNz&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Telegram founder Pavel Durov says that innovators should not be personally liable for the potential abuse of the tools they create. He says that growing pains on Telegram made it easy for criminals to abuse the platform, but that he aims to significantly improve the platform. French authorities arrested Durov in part due to Telegram's apparent lack of response to requests related to criminal investigations, but Durov says Telegram has official representatives in the EU and that he had personally helped French authorities establish a hotline with Telegram to deal with the threat of terrorism in France. Telegram is expected to announce changes to address the abuse of its platform very soon.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### A next-gen pain drug shows promise, but chronic sufferers need more options (17 minute read)](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/next-gen-drug-chronic-pain-alternative?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is currently seeking regulatory approval for a new drug that looks promising in clinical trials. Suzetrigine could be the first of an entirely new class of pain therapy. It targets specific sodium ion channels found on pain-sensing nerve cells. While the effect of the drug is modest, it demonstrates that the strategy of targeting sodium channels specific to pain-sensing neurons works, leading to hope that the next generation of these compounds could perform much better. Suzetrigine could be approved by early 2025.

[### The ultra-selfish gene (35 minute read)](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-ultra-selfish-gene/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It is now possible for humans to genetically modify entire species by inserting genes into them with brute force. The technology has so far gone unused, even though its deployment could mean the end of diseases like malaria. It could be used for many positive things such as giving raccoons immunity to rabies, editing insects so that they're more vulnerable to safer pesticides, and preventing the spread of deadly diseases. However, its existence presents many issues, such as the possibility of a harmful gene being released into human populations.

[### The AI industry is obsessed with Chatbot Arena, but it might not be the best benchmark (13 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/05/the-ai-industry-is-obsessed-with-chatbot-arena-but-it-might-not-be-the-best-benchmark/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

LMSYS' Chatbot Arena has become an industry obsession over the past few months. It lets anyone on the web ask questions of two randomly selected, anonymous models and then vote on their preferred answers. Critics say that LMSYS has not been completely transparent about the model capabilities, knowledge, and skills it's assessing on Chatbot Arena. The limited data released by the company makes it challenging to study the limitations of models in depth. While Chatbot Arena is framed as an empirical test, it amounts to a relative rating of models.
