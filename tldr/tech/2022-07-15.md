[### Sampling sucks. You can do better (Sponsor)](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/devops/the-hidden-cost-of-sampling-in-observability.html)

Here‚Äôs a secret that many observability vendors don‚Äôt want you to know: [throwing out data has serious consequences](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/devops/the-hidden-cost-of-sampling-in-observability.html). Sampling might sound like a good way to lower costs or a workaround for systems that can‚Äôt handle large volumes of data‚Äîbut it can make you miss critical issues such as bursty moments where latency spikes above 5 seconds.

In any observability system, you need all the data you can get. Sampling data makes it harder to get answers. [Read the new blog post](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/devops/the-hidden-cost-of-sampling-in-observability.html) by Greg Leiffer, Observability Practitioner Director at Splunk, to understand [why sampling must be avoided in observability](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/devops/the-hidden-cost-of-sampling-in-observability.html)

[### Physicists Find The 'Missing Link' That Could Provide Quantum Internet Technology (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-find-the-missing-link-that-could-provide-quantum-internet-technology?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

New research shows that certain defects in silicon qubits, known as T centers, can act as light-based links between qubits. T centers could make scalable, distributed quantum computers possible by combining high-performance spin qubits and optical photon generation. They can handle processing and communications together, which makes systems more efficient and easier to build. T centers emit light at the same wavelength used by fiber communications and telecom networks, making rolling out quantum internet technology potentially more straightforward.

[### A new sodium-ion battery breakthrough means they may one day power EVs (3 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2022/07/14/sodium-ion-battery-breakthrough/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sodium-ion batteries operate well in colder temperatures and are energy dense, nonflammable, and made out of cheap and abundant materials. However, their performance has always been limited by poor durability. US-based researchers have developed a sodium-ion battery that can go through over 300 charging cycles while retaining over 90% of its capacity. The battery's temperature-change resistance, stability, and long cycle life could make it valuable for electric vehicles or energy storage applications.
