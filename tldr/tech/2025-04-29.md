Manual testing on personal devices is too slow and too limited. It forces teams to cut releases a week early just to test before submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage, issues slip through.

[### Amazon launches first Kuiper internet satellites in bid to take on Elon Musk's Starlink (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/28/amazon-launches-first-kuiper-satellites-in-bid-to-take-on-starlink.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon launched its first batch of 27 Kuiper internet satellites into space on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) rocket at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida shortly after 7 PM ET yesterday. The Federal Communications Commission expects Amazon to launch half of its total constellation up in the air by July 2026. Amazon has booked more than 80 launches with ULA, SpaceX, Arianespace, and Blue Origin to deploy dozens of satellites at a time. The company will invest up to $10 billion to build the Kuiper network.

[### ChatGPT goes shopping with new product-browsing feature (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/chatgpt-goes-shopping-with-new-product-browsing-feature/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has announced new shopping features in ChatGPT Search that will allow users to search for products and purchase them through merchant websites after being redirected from the ChatGPT interface. The experience resembles Google Shopping - users click on a product image and the interface displays multiple retailers on the right side of the screen with buttons to complete purchases. Product reviews come from various online sources and users can choose which review sources for ChatGPT to prioritize. The product results are not sponsored for now, but the company is likely working towards enabling sponsored placements.

[### First 3D-printed Starbucks coffee shop opens tomorrow in Texas (2 minute read)](https://www.tomshardware.com/3d-printing/first-3d-printed-starbucks-coffee-shop-opens-tomorrow-in-texas?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new 3D-printed Starbucks has opened in Brownsville, Texas. The Cobod BOD2-printed concrete fabricated shop is open for both in-person pickup and drive-through orders. It is not a very large store - its 1,400 sq ft shell is just enough for a mobile order pick-up desk and a drive-through coffee shop. There is no indoor seating and no in-person walk-in order system.

[### Tooth Successfully Grown in Lab (3 minute read)](https://www.newsweek.com/human-tooth-grown-lab-kings-college-london-2059872?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from London's King's College and Imperial College have grown a tooth in a lab. They used a specially developed material to mimic the conditions required for natural tooth development. The technology could eventually offer patients a biological alternative to artificial fillings and implants. Now that researchers have replicated the right environment, the challenge is in translating the discovery into a clinical setting.

[### Magnitude (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/magnitudedev/magnitude?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Magnitude is an end-to-end testing framework powered by visual AI agents that can see interfaces and adapt to any changes in them. It features a strong reasoning agent for planning and adjusting tests, a fast visual agent for reliably executing runs, and a reasoning agent that steps in if there is a problem. Magnitude saves plans to execute runs in the same way locally or in CI/CD pipelines.

[### The One-Person Framework in practice (8 minute read)](https://bramjetten.dev/articles/the-one-person-framework-in-practice?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

PlanGo had one developer until 2025. This was made possible through Rails, which allowed the developer to be fast and efficient. The company's apps combined have over 100,000 yearly downloads, all built and maintained by one Rails developer. This post discusses how PlanGo was developed, the lessons learned over 14 years of building as a solo technical founder, and PlanGo's future plans.

[### Sycophancy is the first LLM "dark pattern" (5 minute read)](https://www.seangoedecke.com/ai-sycophancy/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's models being overly sycophantic is bad because it's dangerous to validate people's belief that they're always in the right. This sycophancy is a dark pattern - a user interface designed to trick users into doing things they'd prefer not to do. The whole process of turning an AI base model into a model you can chat to is a process of making the model want to please the user. The problem happens when users collide with the real world and do things because a large language model has convinced them it is a good idea - and then they return to the model for comfort, and sink even deeper into the illusion.

[### On Dropouts and Bootstraps (3 minute read)](https://charity.wtf/2025/04/28/on-dropouts-and-bootstraps/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many in the tech industry arrived at where they are through their own work and research - reading the source code, books, and manuals and trying things out. While this may make some of them think they're better than college graduates, this is likely not the case: people are really good at justifying their status, and this is just another way for some people to reinforce existing power structures. A lot of college dropouts worked really hard to get where they are, but that doesn't mean they didn't also just get very lucky.
