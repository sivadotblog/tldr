[### Decomposing Language Models Into Understandable Components (5 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/index/decomposing-language-models-into-understandable-components?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Neural networks are trained on data and not programmed to follow rules. While we understand the math of trained networks, we don't understand why those mathematical operations result in the behaviors we see, making it hard to diagnose failure modes and certify that a model is truly safe. This article presents a method for analyzing language models to determine how they work that involves looking at units in small transformer models rather than at individual neurons.

[### Unbundling AI (15 minute read)](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2023/10/5/unbundling-ai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

LLMs allow users to ask anything and almost get an answer to everything. However, the answers it returns could be wrong, and even if the answers are correct, they might not be the right way to solve the problem. They are probabilistic models that provide the most probable answers. Large language models are currently a general-purpose technology that can do some theoretically magic stuff, but for many people, they still look a bit like the PC ads of the late 1970s that promised computers could be used for anything.
