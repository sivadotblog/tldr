[### The genetic engineering behind pig-to-human transplants (8 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/the-genetic-engineering-behind-pig-to-human-transplants/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Last year, doctors transplanted a pair of pig kidneys into a brain-dead patient in an experimental procedure to test the viability of genetically modified pig organs in humans. The pig was provided by a company called Revivicor, who also generated the donor for the recent pig-human heart transplant. Revivicor's pigs have a number of their own genes removed and several human genes introduced to reduce the likelihood that the human immune system will reject the organs. The results of the experiment were inconclusive as the patient was too injured. Details about which genes were edited for what effect are available in the article.
