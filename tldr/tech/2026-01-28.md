[### Try text scaling support in Chrome Canary (7 minute read)](https://www.joshtumath.uk/posts/2026-01-27-try-text-scaling-support-in-chrome-canary/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The new 'meta name=text-scale' HTML tag informs browsers that websites are designed to still work if users increase their OS text size. To support text scaling, developers should avoid overriding the initial font size, only use font-relative units for content, and test on devices to quickly figure out problem areas and think about how to adapt their layouts. The tag is currently supported in Chrome Canary with the 'Experimental Web Platform features' flag enabled. Support in other browsers will hopefully come later this year.
