[### SpaceX's next Starship launch‚Äîand first catch‚Äîcould happen this weekend (9 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/spacexs-next-starship-launch-and-first-catch-could-happen-this-weekend/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX's Starship rocket could fly again as soon as Sunday. The test is still pending FAA approval. The last public statement released by the FAA suggested the agency didn't expect to determine whether to approve the license before late November, but there is some optimism at SpaceX that it will issue a launch license much sooner. The fifth Starship test flight will attempt the first-ever return to the launch site and catch of the Super Heavy booster. SpaceX won't attempt to reignite Starship's Raptor engines in space on the upcoming flight - the spacecraft will come to a soft splashdown in a target area in the Indian Ocean.

[### Samsung says it's in ‚Äúcrisis,‚Äù apologizes for missing profit target (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/samsung-says-its-in-crisis-apologizes-for-missing-profit-target/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Samsung issued a public apology and acknowledged it is in a 'crisis' following the release of its profit guidance on Tuesday. It reported a preliminary profit that undershot market expectations, and its share price has fallen almost 30% over the past six months. The worse-than-expected guidance underlines investor concerns about deteriorating memory market conditions and the possibility of slowing AI investment by big tech groups. Samsung is cutting some of its overseas staff and wrestling with growing worker discontent at home.

[### Groundbreaking Ovarian Cancer Vaccine at an "Exciting" Moment, Lead Scientist Says (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/neoscope/first-ovarian-cancer-vaccine?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at Oxford have started developing an ovarian cancer vaccine that imbues the immune system with the ability to recognize and attack early-stage ovarian cancer cells. The research is currently focusing on women with one or two specific mutations known to be linked to a higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The vaccine still needs to go through several rounds of trials, a process that could take years, before human clinical trials can begin.

[### How Long Til We're All on Ozempic? (24 minute read)](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/07/how-long-til-were-all-on-ozempic?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The supply of GLP-1 medications like Ozempic has been plagued with shortages. While companies are doing what they can to increase supply, it is extremely unlikely that demand will be met in the near term. This article looks at growth for GLP-1 drugs over the next six years and how many people will stand to benefit from them over this time. More than two in five people in the US are overweight, so increasing access to the drug will have a large benefit on the population.

[### Cognitive Load is what matters (28 minute read)](https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cognitive load is how much a developer needs to think in order to complete a task. Confusion, which is caused by high cognitive load, costs time and money. Developers spend far more time reading and understanding code than writing it, so they should constantly ask themselves whether they are embedding excessive cognitive load into their code and reduce that load.

[### Automattic is doing open source dirty (3 minute read)](https://world.hey.com/dhh/automattic-is-doing-open-source-dirty-b95cf128?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Automattic demanding 8% of WP Engine's revenues for not 'giving back enough' to WordPress is a violation of general open source ideals and the specifics of the GPL license. The potential damage to the open source world extends far beyond WordPress. Open source has been successful over the last several decades because of the clarity and certainty of its licensing regime, which allows people to build a business on open source without fear of frivolous claims or surprise shakedowns. The integrity of these licenses is under direct assault by Automattic's claim for WP Engine's revenues. Automattic is able to change its license away from the GPL if it wishes.
