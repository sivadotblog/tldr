### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists got lab-grown human brain cells to play 'Pong' (3 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/brain-cells-pong-rats-182835843.html?src=rss?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

DishBrain is a culture of 800,000 mice and human brain cells created by biotech startup Cortical Labs. The mice cells were derived from embryonic brains while the human cells were created from stem cells. DishBrain is considered too primitive to be conscious, but it was able to learn how to play Pong within just a few minutes. The cell culture could potentially be used as a stand-in for the human brain in future studies.
