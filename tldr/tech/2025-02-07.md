Meatly's Chick Bites, a dog treat made from lab-grown meat, are getting a limited release at a single pet store in the UK today. The company plans to expand production in hopes of making its lab-grown meat more widely available. The UK gave Meatly the green light to produce pet food made from lab-grown meat in July last year. Chick Bites are made from a combination of plant-based ingredients and Meatly's lab-grown chicken, which the company claims is just as tasty and nutritious as traditional chicken breast.

Life still exists in some of the coldest, darkest places on Earth, where there is barely any light. Some phytoplankton living in the Arctic are able to survive without becoming dormant even during periods of 24-hour darkness. These organisms have their photosynthetic machines up and running as soon as the barest amount of sunlight returns. It is still unclear how the microalgae stay alive out of dormancy. The ability may be shared by algae in other areas of the deep sea, which means that the zone of productive ocean may be deeper than previously thought.

[### Nontraditional Red Teams (5 minute read)](https://zachholman.com/posts/red-teams?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Every development team should have some exposure to red team practices. Developers should check user-generated content for offensive messaging and make sure their sites work correctly with ad blockers. They should also make sure their forms work with password managers. None of these factors are major blockers, but they're easy to prevent. It's important to use your eyes before shipping.
