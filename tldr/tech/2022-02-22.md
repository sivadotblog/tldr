[### Apple Reportedly Completes Production Tests for AR/VR Headset (1 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/21/apple-completes-ar-vr-headset-production-tests/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple has completed key production tests for its long-rumored augmented and virtual reality headset. The headset is now expected to debut by the end of 2022 for around $3,000. It is rumored to feature a lightweight design, two 4K micro-LED displays, 15 optical modules, two main processors, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, eye tracking, a see-through AR mode, object tracking, hand gesture controls, and more. Apple has been rumored to be working on the headset's operating system since 2017.

[### Amazon's sprawling grocery business has become an 'expensive hobby' with a cloudy future (12 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/19/amazons-sprawling-grocery-business-has-become-an-expensive-hobby.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Despite spending billions on developing services and technologies to become a grocery market giant, Amazon is still just a niche player in the industry. Its delivery services have failed to stand out in a crowded field and its Go automated convenience stores have been deprioritized. The technology Amazon implemented in its stores was novel, but it didn't add any value to the shopping experience. Groceries were not a big topic on Amazon's fourth-quarter results call earlier this month.

[### Sound waves convert stem cells into bone in regenerative breakthrough (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/medical/sound-waves-stem-cells-bone/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists in Australia have found a way to induce stem cells to turn into bone cells quickly and efficiently by using high-frequency sound waves. Collecting the cells needed to grow bone is usually painful and the process is hard to scale. The new method is cheap, simple to use, and can be easily scaled. It uses cells that can be obtained from fat tissue and the cells it produces can be injected into the body at the required site, removing the need for drugs to coax stem cells down a path and making the process faster and more efficient.

[### A Mysterious Desert Bacterium Has Evolved Its Own, Unique Ability to Photosynthesize (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-photosynthesising-complex-discovered-in-mysterious-bacterium?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have discovered a species of bacteria from the Gobi desert that can photosynthesize using a unique structure. It obtained the genes for photosynthesis from an ancient proteobacterium, demonstrating the power of bacteria's horizontal gene-transfer skills. The bacteria has a central reaction center, an inner sunlight-capturing ring, and an outer ring, making it larger than other photosynthesizing bacteria. Its structure could hold the secrets to building a future of solar-powered synthetic biology.
