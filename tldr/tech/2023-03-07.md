[### A new class of drugs for weight loss could end obesity (16 minute read)](https://archive.ph/4eE2y#selection-593.31-593.54?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many celebrities are using a new class of weight-loss drugs to keep their figures slim. Obesity is a common health issue, with costs increasing faster in poorer nations. Processed food and sedentary lifestyles have contributed significantly to the obesity epidemic. Medication may not be a suitable long-term solution as patients can become reliant on them. Doctors remain cautious of the long-term use of these drugs due to a lack of data regarding lifelong usage. Reducing global obesity by just 5% could lead to annual global savings of $429 billion.

[### "Plasticosis:" New disease in birds highlights dangers of microplastics (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/biology/plasticosis-new-disease-microplastics-birds/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have identified a new disease caused by plastic waste in the environment called plasticosis. Although the disease is currently only found in the digestive tracts of seabirds, it is suspected it affects other species and body parts due to the widespread use of plastic in our modern world. Plastic lodged in the digestive tracts of birds leads to chronic inflammation, scarring, and digestive gland stunting, which may affect vitamin absorption and cause vulnerability to infections and parasites. Plasticosis was named after other fibrotic diseases caused by inorganic materials such as silicosis and asbestosis.

[### A Privacy Hero's Final Wish: An Institute to Redirect AI's Future (4 minute read)](https://archive.ph/lViGi?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Peter Eckersley was a web encryption pioneer. The AI Objectives Institute (AOI), has taken on Eckersley's work to redirect the future of artificial intelligence away from destructive forces. Eckersley envisioned AOI as a hub for major AI labs to come together and incubate ideas that actively contribute to human flourishing. AI has the potential to amplify existing global issues such as environmental destruction, exploitation of the poor, and rampant nationalism. Rather than attempting to restrict AI's progress, AOI aims to steer AI towards a better future by channeling its efforts to help alleviate current global issues.

Twitter users faced a series of issues on Monday, including error messages and images not loading. The company later explained that this was due to the shutdown of free access to the Twitter API, which ended third-party clients and greatly limited the ability of researchers to study the network. The company has been working on a new paid API for developers but only one engineer is working on the project. This engineer made a configuration change which broke the Twitter API, leading to the breakdown of internal tools along with public-facing APIs.
