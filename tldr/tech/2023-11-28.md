Some strange metals carry currents through them without electrons. A new quantum phenomenon is likely responsible for electricity flow within metals. Currents move more like liquids than a collective movement of electrons when moving through these metals. Research is starting to show that there is a different phase of matter within these materials.

[### Some thoughts on causality in biological systems (7 minute read)](https://nintil.com/causality-biology/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It can be difficult to establish causality in biology. Adding to the difficulty is the fact that something can be an important factor but not a cause of a disease. In biology, 'X causes Y' tends to many 'X is necessary and sufficient for Y'. We have to start thinking of systems where we can talk about causation in a more realistic way to make progress in biology.

[### Vitalik Buterin's techno-optimism (72 minute read)](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Vitalik Buterin believes in a future that is vastly brighter than the present thanks to radically transformative technology. He rejects the idea that we should keep the world roughly the same as today but be less greedy with more public health care. Some technologies will reliably make the world better than other types of technology - we need active human intention to choose the directions that we want as the best outcome will not be achieved automatically.

[### Why do companies hire people to be idle a lot of the time? (3 minute read)](https://ntietz.com/blog/why-do-companies-hire-people-to-be-idle-a-lot-of-the-time/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Big Tech employs a lot of engineers, some of whom do very little. Some say that companies do this to keep talent off the market, but that might not be the case. Large projects sometimes require a lot of people to be idle - even if they don't seem like they're doing anything at the moment, they might play a critical role in the process later. Prestige and budgets are also factors that can also lead to idle engineers.
