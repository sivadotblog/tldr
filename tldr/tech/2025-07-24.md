[### Tesla claims it produced the first builds of its ‚Äònew affordable' electric car models (3 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2025/07/23/tesla-claims-produced-first-builds-new-affordable-electric-car-models/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla claims to have produced the first builds of its new, more affordable electric car models in June. Volume production has been planned for the second half of the year. Plans for a 2025 launch remain on track. The vehicle is expected to be a 'stripped-down' Model Y with fewer materials, fewer features, and possibly a slightly smaller size.

T-Mobile and SpaceX's T-Satellite service is now available to subscribers, allowing smartphone users to remain connected even in deadzones. Existing T-Mobile customers can purchase the cellular Starlink service as an add-on - those on pricier plans like Experience Beyond and Go5G Next get it as a free perk. People on other networks can also subscribe through a secondary eSIM. Those who participated in the free trial should now expect to be charged for the service.

[### Neuralink Sees $1 Billion of Revenue by 2031 in Vast Expansion (4 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/neuralink-sees-1-billion-of-revenue-by-2031-in-vast-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MzMzMzQ0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzUzOTM4MjQ1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWlJMMElHUEZIWEIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.iogrKwksvC2F6AeK9dxlOO2wcnNBuFA70-iuwl2geNk&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Neuralink expects to put its chips in 20,000 people a year and generate at least $1 billion in annual revenue by 2031. It plans to have about five large clinics in operation and at least three versions of its device available. The company's figures assume a conservative reimbursement of $50,000 per surgery. Several other brain companies are building and testing similar devices. No brain-computer interfaces have yet been commercially approved for permanent implantation by the US FDA - Neuralink expects to gain regulatory approval in the US for its first device by 2029.

[### Meta Unveils Wristband for Controlling Computers With Hand Gestures (7 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/science/meta-computer-wristband-reardon.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Y08.oqHy.AJVm2pu7D5lT&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta's wristband reads the electrical signals that pulse through the muscles when people move their fingers. It uses a technique called electromyography to gather electrical signals from muscles in the forearm. These signals can reveal what people are about to do even before they do it. With enough practice, people using the wristband can control devices simply by producing the right thought.

[### Docs for AI agents (11 minute read)](https://technicalwriting.dev/ai/agents/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Agent docs are a way to get better results from agents. They make agent output more consistent, more aligned with codebase conventions, and more accurate. This post discusses how to implement agent docs into a project. It covers how agent docs are different from internal eng docs, best practices for AI docs, and reasons why agent and eng docs should be kept separate.

[### A valid HTML zip bomb (5 minute read)](https://ache.one/notes/html_zip_bomb?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

One way to deal with aggressive web crawlers that don't respect robots.txt is to exhaust their resources. This post goes through how to build a valid HTML zip bomb that exhausts bots' RAM. The implementation technique exploits the asymmetry of the resources needed to serve the zip bomb versus those needed to detect it. Bots that respect robots.txt won't be affected by the zip bomb as the path to the zip bomb is forbidden in the specification.
