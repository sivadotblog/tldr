[### Google considered blocking Safari users from accessing its new AI features, report says (3 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/05/google-search-iphone-safari-ai-features/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Convincing iOS users to use Google's own apps instead of Safari has been a challenge for Google. Google hired former Instagram and Yahoo executive Robby Stein to oversee the push from Safari. The company reportedly considered limiting its AI Overviews feature to its own apps, excluding Safari users, but ultimately decided against the move.

[### Apple green lights Epic Games Store in rapid reversal (3 minute read)](https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/05/apple-green-lights-epic-games-store-in-rapid-reversal?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple has given approval for the Epic Games store for iOS in the EU. Epic's submission was rejected twice previously. The latest decision was reversed just hours after reports started circulating about it. Apple objected to Epic's inclusion of a download button and related copy and has asked the company to fix the buttons in a future submission of the app. Epic still has a lot of work before its app store will be ready - it plans to bring the store to iOS in the next couple of months.

[### There will be blood (25 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/article/ultimate-blood-substitute-us-military-betting-46-million?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

ErythroMer is an experimental blood substitute developed by researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. It is made from recycled human hemoglobin wrapped in a membrane to mimic a tiny cell. ErythroMer comes as a freeze-dried powder that remains usable for years. It can be reconstituted by simply mixing it with saline. ErythroMer should be safe for any blood type as its membrane doesn't include the red blood cell surface proteins that cause mismatches. It is still in preclinical testing, but it is possible that ErythroMer could be more durable and versatile than real blood.

[### The world's first anode-free sodium solid-state battery (6 minute read)](https://pme.uchicago.edu/news/uchicago-prof-shirley-mengs-laboratory-energy-storage-and-conversion-creates-worlds-first?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Laboratory for Energy Storage and Conversion has created the world's first anode-free sodium solid-state battery. The battery brings the reality of inexpensive, fast-charging, high-capacity batteries for electric vehicles and grid storage closer than ever. It has an architecture with stable cycling for several hundred cycles and is more affordable and environmentally friendly to produce than lithium batteries. Sodium, common in ocean water and soda ash mining, is an inherently more environmentally friendly battery material.

[### Pongo (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/event-driven-io/Pongo?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Pongo is Mongo on Postgres with strong consistency benefits. It treats PostgreSQL as a document database with JSONB support, adding significant performance and storage efficiency. Pongo takes the MongoDB API and translates it to native PostgreSQL queries. Using JSONB means that data is preparsed, allowing faster read and write operations. JSONB retains the flexibility of storing semi-structured data while allowing users to take advantage of PostgreSQL's robust querying capabilities.

Microsoft's 12-year-long attempt at making Windows on Arm happen is starting to pay off. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips are turning Windows on Arm into a viable platform. While the chips don't outright beat Apple's M3 chip in every benchmark, this is the closest Microsoft has been able to compete so far with MacBooks in price, performance, and battery life. Microsoft's new lineup could make Intel and AMD scramble to catch up.

[### A New Age of Materials Is Dawning, for Everything From Smartphones to Missiles (7 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/composites-manufacturing-boeing-drones-arris-9t-orbital-a422de1b?st=pteg3x0i5wm2cit&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Composite materials have the advantage of being lighter than the metal parts they typically replace while being just as strong and requiring fewer resources to make. The labor-intensive nature of their manufacturing has made them expensive and limited their application to a handful of areas. New manufacturing techniques that can churn out composite parts quickly and cheaply are changing the field. This article takes a look at emerging composites technologies and the materials and products they are creating.
