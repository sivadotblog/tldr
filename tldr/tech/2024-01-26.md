### Big Tech & Startups

[### New embedding models and API updates (8 minute read)](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is launching new models, reducing prices for GPT-3.5 Turbo, and introducing new ways for developers to manage API keys and understand API usage. The new models include two new embedding models, an updated GPT-4 Turbo preview model, an updated GPT-3.5 Turbo model, and an updated text moderation model. The updated GPT-4 Turbo preview model completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly than previous preview models and is intended to reduce cases of 'laziness'. OpenAI plans to launch GPT-4 Turbo with vision in general availability in the coming months.

[### Apple is bringing sideloading and alternate app stores to the iPhone (5 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050200/apple-third-party-app-stores-allowed-iphone-ios-europe-digital-markets-act?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple has announced plans to change rules for developers releasing iOS software in the EU. Third-party app stores will be allowed on iOS for the first time. The changes will arrive with iOS 17.6 in March. Marketplaces will have to go through Apple's approval process and can be set as the default on devices. Developers can choose to use Apple's payment services or integrate third-party systems. All apps must still be notarized by Apple, and distribution through third-party marketplaces will still be managed by Apple's systems. Developers will only be allowed to distribute a single version of their app across different app stores.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Researchers showcase a speedy new approach to printing metal (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/researchers-showcase-a-speedy-new-approach-to-printing-metal/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team at MIT has announced a new method of 3D printing metal that prioritizes printing speeds and scale over resolution. It is capable of printing large aluminum parts at least 10 times faster than comparable metal additive manufacturing processes. The technique utilizes a bed of 100-micron glass beads to create a structure into which molten aluminum is deposited. The beads can stand intense temperatures while allowing heat to quickly dissipate. While the final product doesn't offer near the pinpoint accuracy of some other methods, the technique's quick turnaround makes it a candidate for revolutionizing the way metal printing and metal forming are currently handled.

[### Airborne infection risk plummets in face of metal nanoparticle spray (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/materials/airborne-infection-risk-metal-nanoparticle-spray/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new sprayable coating applied to standard air filters may help protect against airborne respiratory infections like measles, influenza, SARS, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. It provides a greater than 99% antiviral activity while also completely stopping bacterial growth. The spray doesn't interfere with the effectiveness of filters doing their normal job of removing other particles from the air. There are many other similar technologies in the works, but they will all need more development before they become commercially available.

iOS 17.4 will introduce a change that will allow alternative browser engineers to run on iOS. Developers will have to be authorized by Apple to switch engines, which involves meeting specific criteria and committing to a number of ongoing privacy and security mitigations. The change will only apply to people with EU-based accounts. EU users will be presented with a new choice screen for choosing a default browser when opening Safari for the first time.

Tesla has backed off its bullish sales targets due to growing EV sales by rival brands. The company has been cutting prices for more than a year to boost sales. It lost the lead in global EV sales to Chinese automaker BYD in the fourth quarter of 2023. Elon Musk told analysts on a call that Chinese carmakers will have significant success outside of China. He believes that current trade barriers are preventing Chinese car manufacturers from demolishing most other car companies in the world.
