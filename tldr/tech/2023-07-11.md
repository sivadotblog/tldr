Threads has already surpassed 100 million users, reaching the milestone dramatically faster than ChatGPT. It took ChatGPT two months to pass the mark, while Threads only launched last Wednesday. Users have made more than 95 million posts and shared 190 million likes on the platform. Mark Zuckerberg said in a post that the growth was mostly organic. Threads is still in its infancy and it is yet to be seen whether the platform will retain its users.

[### Inside Google‚Äôs big AI shuffle ‚Äî and how it plans to stay competitive (47 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/23778745/demis-hassabis-google-deepmind-ai-alphafold-risks?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article contains a transcript of an interview with Dennis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind. Google DeepMind is the result of an internal merger between DeepMind and Google's previous internal AI team called Google Brain. DeepMind was purchased in 2014 and the merger was completed earlier this year. The two divisions were not focused on the same things when they were merged, resulting in a culture clash. The interview covers the merger and the dramas around it as well as AI risk and artificial general intelligence.

[### Longshot Space wants to make space launch dumb ‚Äî and really cheap (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/10/longshot-space-wants-to-make-space-launch-dumb-and-really-cheap-too/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Longshot Space's CEO Mike Grace thinks that rockets are an overly exquisite solution to the problem of sending large masses to space. The company's answer is a kinetic launch system that will be capable of reaching hypersonic speeds and shooting projectiles to orbital velocities for as low as $10 per kilogram. Its system involves a multiple-kilometer-long horizontal concrete tunnel that is basically a vacuum chamber. The system will generate a lot of noise, so it will have to be built somewhere very remote.

Meta had been planning to release Threads for a while, but the backlash to Twitter's recent limiting of how many tweets people can see per day pushed the company to get the app out of the door. This article contains a transcript of an interview with Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, on how the Threads project started, the decision-making process when developing the standalone app, Threads' ActivityPub integration, why Threads isn't available in the EU, Mosseri‚Äôs views on Twitter, and more. Threads' success shows that there is room in the market for multiple players in different spaces.

[### Invisible Details of Interaction Design (15 minute read)](https://rauno.me/craft/interaction-design?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Design can feel like there's no science to it, but there are many enthusiasts who spend their time deconstructing designs to find out the why behind great displays of interaction design. This article presents observations on common interactions as an exercise in building stronger design intuition and vocabulary. It covers metaphors, gestures, spatial consistency, touch inputs, and much more. Understanding and articulating why something feels right might not come as intuitively as designing something to feel right, but they're two sides of the same coin.
