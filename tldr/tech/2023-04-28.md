Researchers from the Helmholtz Munich research institute have created a technique that can turn mice corpses transparent, transforming them into 3D maps of anatomy. The technique exposes tissues to fluorescent antibodies that label distinct cell types, highlighting tissues, nerves, and vessels in color. It will allow scientists to map a mouse at the cellular level and explore previously hidden links. The technique currently only allows two cell types at a time to be labeled, but the team is working on increasing its abilities.
