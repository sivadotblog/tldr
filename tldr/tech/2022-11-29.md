[### New survey reveals % of business decisions made based on actual data (Sponsor)](https://cdata.com/resources/451-business-impact-brief-integration-automation/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=email)

Is ‚Äòdata-driven‚Äô just a mantra or a reality for most businesses?

But as data sources become increasingly distributed, access to data can become an uphill battle. Businesses are inundated with applications which often don‚Äôt sufficiently integrate with one another.

New approaches to data connectivity can help companies overcome these obstacles and put data in decisionmakers‚Äô hands.

[### Scientists Have Found a Way To Manipulate Digital Data Stored in DNA (3 minute read)](https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-have-found-a-way-to-manipulate-digital-data-stored-in-dna/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from CNRS and the University of Tokyo have developed an enzyme-based technique that provides clues on how to read and manipulate data written on DNA. The enzymes react to create chemical neurons that reproduce the ability for complex calculations exhibited by true neurons. These chemical neurons can execute calculations with data on DNA and express the results as fluorescent signals. The technique could result in better screening for certain diseases.

[### New AI Speeds Computer Graphics by Up to 5x (5 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-graphics-neural-rendering?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

DLSS 3 (Deep Learning Super Sampling) combines AI-powered image upscaling and optical multiframe generation. It combines sequential frames with an optical flow field used to predict changes between frames, then it slots AI-generated frames between traditionally rendered frames. DLSS can speed up performance by over 500% in some games. A video with a side-by-side comparison of DLSS 3-rendered graphics and normal graphics is available in the article.
