[### Apple launches Invites, a new app for creating custom invitations (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/apple-launches-invites-a-new-app-for-creating-custom-invitations/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's new Invites app allows users to create, share, and RSVP to events. It also allows users to contribute to Shared Albums and create event soundtracks. The app requires an iCloud+ subscription, but anyone can RSVP to events regardless of whether they have an Apple account or device. Invites is now available for free on the App Store for all iPhones running on iOS 18 or later and can be accessed on the web.

[### OpenAI's Sora Filmmaking Tool Meets Resistance in Hollywood (6 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/openai-s-sora-filmmaking-tool-meets-resistance-in-hollywood?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODcyODc5OSwiZXhwIjoxNzM5MzMzNTk5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUTFQUDlUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.-tSgWp3MMEEG65c73iZ7OX7AVyE6PwB2DqSog7cVej8&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has been talking to the movie industry's largest studios for months, but those talks have yet to produce any deals. Studios are reluctant to get into business with an AI company as it may anger the labor unions that they work with. Screenwriters and actors have been urging studios to police tech companies and ensure that their work isn't being used illegally. OpenAI found a receptive audience among some filmmakers when it released its Sora AI video generator early last year, but conversations with studios have been more complicated. While studios recognize that AI is already changing how people work, they are reluctant to hand over their most valuable assets to large tech firms without receiving a significant payout.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### With generative AI, MIT chemists quickly calculate 3D genomic structures (7 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2025/with-generative-ai-mit-chemists-quickly-calculate-3d-genomic-structures-0131?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

MIT chemists have figured out a new method for determining 3D genome structures using generative artificial intelligence. The technique can predict thousands of structures in minutes. It can be used to easily study how the 3D organization of the genome affects individual cells' gene expression patterns and functions. It could also be used to explore how mutations in DNA sequences can cause disease. The model and all of the data are available on GitHub.

[### Our Brains Are Soaking Up Microplastics More Than Other Organs (3 minute read)](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/our-brains-are-soaking-up-microplastics-more-than-other-organs?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microplastics have been detected in human brains at much higher concentrations than in other organs. Much of the plastic appears to be smaller than previously thought, with some pieces only about two to three times the size of a virus. People diagnosed with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as others, but there is not enough evidence to definitively conclude on cause or effect. It is unknown what effect microplastics have on human health, but the tiniest pieces can cross the blood-brain barrier.

### Programming, Design & Data Science

[### Beej's Guide to Git (Website)](https://beej.us/guide/bggit/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Git is a version control system that keeps snapshots of source code in directory trees. It allows users to make changes and then commit those changes to the source code repository once a feature is ready. Git keeps a history of all commits made, so users can look at previous commits whenever required. This page contains a guide to Git that covers the basics and how to use it. It assumes readers have basic POSIX shell usage skills and that they are working in a Unix-like environment.

[### How I use LLMs as a staff engineer (5 minute read)](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This post discusses how a staff engineer from GitHub who worked directly on Copilot uses large language models. Large language models can be helpful for smart autocomplete, short tactical chains, writing use-once-and-throwaway research code, asking questions to learn about new topics, last-resort bug fixes, and proofreading. The technology still isn't great for writing PR, ADRs, or other technical communications. It also isn't great for research in large codebases.

[### Chat is a bad UI pattern for development tools (3 minute read)](https://danieldelaney.net/chat/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Coding forces humans to think like machines. While programming has become more friendly throughout the decades, we are still just translating human thoughts into computer instructions. AI was supposed to allow plain English to become a programming language, but it isn't suitable for building serious software. Current tools pretend that writing software is like having a conversation, but real software can't be built without being precise about requirements. Companies need to build tools for real software instead of toys.

[### OpenAI has undergone its first ever rebrand, giving fresh life to ChatGPT interactions (14 minute read)](https://www.wallpaper.com/tech/openai-has-undergone-its-first-ever-rebrand-giving-fresh-life-to-chatgpt-interactions?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has unveiled a crisp new look for its brand and products. The company has, until now, presented itself with a jumble of fonts, marks, and colors that lack cohesion. The new identity is more organic and human while still presenting a sense of authority, technological sophistication, and research-focused underpinnings. It is present through the interface and presentation of all of the company's products. This article takes a detailed look at the design.
