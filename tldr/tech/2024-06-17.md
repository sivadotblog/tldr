As techies, we love optimizing stuff. Ever thought of optimizing your hydration?

Turns out, the key to unlocking peak mental performance is electrolytes ‚Äî not chugging more water or caffeine. In fact, overhydrating can cause brain fog and fatigue by diluting blood sodium levels.

[### YouTube looks to be testing server-side ad injection to counter ad blockers (1 minute read)](https://9to5google.com/2024/06/12/youtube-ad-injection/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

YouTube is currently experimenting with server-side ad injection. It is making ads part of the video being streamed instead of delivering them separately, resulting in them being indistinguishable from videos. The implementation breaks extensions like SponsorBlock, which depend on timestamps to mark video sections. Server-side ad injection is still in testing and not yet widely rolled out.

[### Sam Altman says OpenAI could become a for-profit meaning it could eventually IPO (2 minute read)](https://www.neowin.net/news/sam-altman-says-openai-could-become-a-for-profit-meaning-it-could-eventually-ipo/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sam Altman is reportedly considering making OpenAI a for-profit company that the current non-profit board wouldn't control. One possible option being considered is making the company a for-profit benefit corporation. This would mean the company will have to consider its impact on society and the environment and balance the interests of its shareholders with the interests of employees, customers, the community, and the environment. Becoming a for-profit could open up the path to an initial public offering that would give the public a chance to own its shares.

SpaceX aims to fly its full stack Starship rocket for the fifth time in late July. The rocket was able to make a successful soft splashdown during its fourth test, giving the company the confidence to try a tower catch for the fifth test. Another area SpaceX will be testing is the second stage ship's heat shield, which is made of thousands of tiles. Many of the tiles fell off in the previous test even when the ship was on the ground.

[### NVIDIA Warp (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NVIDIA Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance simulation and graphics code. It takes regular Python functions and JIT compiles them to efficient kernel code that can run on the CPU or GPU. Warp comes with a rich set of primitives that make it easy to write programs for physics simulation, perception, robotics, and geometry processing. Its kernels can be used as part of machine learning pipelines with frameworks such as PyTorch and JAX.

Apple skipped over RCS during its keynote, making it seem like the company didn't think it was worthy enough to show off. RCS implementation in iOS is a massive improvement for both Android and iPhone users. Both platforms will now be able to exchange high-resolution media with each other without having to download a third-party messenger.

[### The Big Loser in Tesla's Shareholder Vote Is Delaware (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/tesla-texas-incorporation-delaware-edcbd0dd?st=lp6huzsro7f5ax6&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla's reincorporation in Texas is an attempt by Elon Musk to loosen Delaware's grip on US corporations. Around two-thirds of S&P 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware. The state has specialized courts that handle business matters with stacks of legal precedents to address disputes. Texas offers lower taxes and a newer and less predictable business court system. The move will save Tesla about $250,000 a year in tax payments.
