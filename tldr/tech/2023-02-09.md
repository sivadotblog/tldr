[### Transplanting a Gene Common in Centenarians Could Rewind The Heart's Age by Years (2 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/transplanting-a-gene-common-in-centenarians-could-rewind-the-hearts-age-by-years?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

People who live well into their 90s and beyond commonly have a version of a gene that protects against cardiovascular damage. Scientists rewinded biological markers of heart aging in mice by the equivalent of more than 10 human years by introducing the gene into older mice. The same therapy was shown to halt the decline of heart function in middle-aged mice. It was observed to induce cardiac rejuvenation in test tube studies on human heart cells. The researchers are exploring applying the protein produced by the gene as a treatment, which is safer and more straightforward than gene therapy.
