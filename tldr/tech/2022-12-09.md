The LAN was a magical place to learn about computers. You could do things that would be unthinkable on today‚Äôs internet: permissionless file sharing, experimental servers with no security, and shared software where one machine could easily bring down the network.

In this [classic blog post by Tailscale Co-founder David Crawshaw](https://tailscale.com/blog/remembering-the-lan/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2022-12-09&utm_content=remembering-the-lan), he recalls the childhood magic of the local area network ‚Äî including his non-programmer father building business software for 486 computers, and why the same would be much harder to do today.

Can we have a 90‚Äôs LAN-like experience again, along with the best parts of the 21st-century internet? [Tailscale thinks we can.](https://tailscale.com/blog/remembering-the-lan/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2022-12-09&utm_content=remembering-the-lan)

[### New kilonova has astronomers rethinking what we know about gamma-ray bursts (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/new-kilonova-has-astronomers-rethinking-what-we-know-about-gamma-ray-bursts/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have determined the source of a powerful gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected around a year ago that lasted nearly two minutes. The kilonova was triggered by the merger of two neutron stars. Neutron star mergers usually only produce short GRBs, so the discovery surprised scientists. The discovery is changing what scientists know about GRBs and will make them much harder to classify.

Google's DeepMind has developed an AI system that can produce code in response to programming challenges. The system can produce code that scores near the top half of participants on an average coding challenge. While it can produce code without being given any information about algorithms or programming languages, it has difficulties with problems that require more code. The system was trained on over 700GB of GitHub code and then fine-tuned on a series of programming challenges.

[### Experiment: The hidden costs of waiting on slow build times (6 minute read)](https://github.blog/2022-12-08-experiment-the-hidden-costs-of-waiting-on-slow-build-times/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The cost of hardware is one of the most common objections to providing more powerful computing resources to development teams. However, while faster build times may come with higher upfront costs, the increase in productivity is worth it. It is cheaper and less frustrating for developers to have better hardware. The cost of hours in lost productivity outweighs the upfront cost of faster hardware.
