[### Anne Wojcicki Wins Bidding for 23andMe (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/biotech/anne-wojcicki-wins-bidding-for-23andme-92dcfd5b?st=wMG3WG&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and former CEO of 23andMe, has been named as the new buyer for the company's assets. Biotech company Regeneron won the bidding last month during a bankruptcy auction but bidding reopened earlier this month after Wojcicki's nonprofit, TTAM Research Institute, made an unsolicited offer. Regeneron declined to submit a higher bid based on its assessment of the company's value. If the sale goes through, 23andMe's equity holders could recover some of their investment in the company, a relative rarity in bankruptcy.

[### Walmart and Amazon Are Exploring Issuing Their Own Stablecoins (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/walmart-amazon-stablecoin-07de2fdd?st=Uj2rA8&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Several multinational giants, including Walmart and Amazon, are discussing potential efforts to issue stablecoins. Whether these initiatives will go ahead depends on a bill still yet to clear the Senate and House called the Genius Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins could allow merchants to bypass traditional payment rails, which cost them billions of dollars in fees each year. A regulatory framework for stablecoins would enable an alternative payment type for merchants that could significantly lower their expenses and create competition against Visa and Mastercard.

[### Solar Orbiter gets world-first views of the Sun's poles (11 minute read)](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter/Solar_Orbiter_gets_world-first_views_of_the_Sun_s_poles?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The European Space Agency-led Solar Orbiter spacecraft has imaged the Sun's poles from outside the ecliptic plane. The spacecraft's unique viewing angle will help scientists better understand the Sun's magnetic field, the solar cycle, and the workings of space weather. The complete dataset from Solar Orbiter's first full pole-to-pole flight past the Sun is expected to arrive on Earth by October 2025. A video of the Sun from an angle of 17 degrees below the solar equator - enough to deficiently see the Sun's south pole - is available in the article.

[### Once-a-week pill for schizophrenia shows promise in clinical trials (6 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2025/weekly-pill-schizophrenia-shows-promise-clinical-trials-0610?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Lyndra Therapeutics has created a once-a-week pill for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. The pill contains a widely used medication for managing the disease. A phase 3 clinical trial conducted by Lyndra Therapeutics showed that the patients who took the once-a-week pill maintained consistent levels of the medication just as well as daily doses of the drug. Making the drug easier to administer makes it easier to ensure that patients are receiving their medication.

[### Ask HN: Is ageism in tech still a problem? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44269225&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Ageism has been a problem in tech for many years, and it doesn't look like that has changed. While age brings many positive qualities in terms of skill set, companies may be reluctant to hire older workers as their salary demands are higher and they have stronger work boundaries. Their seniority and directness can also intimidate younger managers and other workers. Younger workers are more likely to be flexible and build whatever without question, which is valuable for business owners.

[### I Convinced HP's Board to Buy Palm for $1.2B. Then I Watched Them Kill It in 49 Days (17 minute read)](https://philmckinney.substack.com/p/i-convinced-hps-board-to-buy-palm?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Phil McKinney convinced HP's board to acquire Palm for $1.2 billion in early 2010 by demonstrating to the board how Palm's WebOS represented a breakthrough platform technology that could differentiate HP in the emerging mobile computing market. A few months after the acquisition, HP's CEO was replaced and McKinney faced a medical emergency that required immediate surgery and an eight-week recovery period confined to bed. During his time in recovery, McKinney was unable to participate in meetings or provide strategic input, resulting in the entire mobile computing landscape at HP unraveling as the new CEO brought a completely different strategic vision. HP ended up discontinuing all WebOS devices just 49 days after it launched the TouchPad.
