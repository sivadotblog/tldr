Cybersecurity researchers investigating the recent Lapsus$ attacks have identified seven accounts associated with the hacking group. A 16-year-old living with his mother in England is believed to be the mastermind of the group. Rival hackers had posted his details online. The attacks were believed to be motivated in part by the desire for notoriety as the group didn't try to cover its tracks and made public announcements.

[### The Speed of Sound on Mars Is Strangely Different (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/we-now-know-the-speed-of-sound-on-mars-thanks-to-perseverance?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

High-frequency sounds travel more than 10 meters per second faster on Mars than low-frequency sounds due to the unique properties of carbon dioxide molecules at low pressure. During the day, the warming of the surface of Mars generates convective updrafts that create strong turbulence, resulting in temperature and pressure fluctuations. The discovery was made using microphones and lasers aboard the Perseverance rover. Changes in the speed of sound also helped researchers measure large and rapid temperature changes that other sensors were not able to detect.

[### Researchers make a quantum storage breakthrough by storing a qubit for 20 milliseconds (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/researchers-make-a-quantum-storage-breakthrough-by-storing-a-qubit-for-20-milliseconds?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=article&utm_content=23032022?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from the University of Geneva broke a new record by storing a qubit in a crystal for 20 milliseconds. The development could help create secure long-distance quantum telecommunication networks. Photons that carry qubits disappear after traveling a few hundred kilometers inside optical fiber cables. The storage could be integrated into repeaters to extend network ranges. The researchers aim to have a system on the market within 10 years.

Researchers from the Netherlands have detected multiple types of microplastics in the blood of nearly 80% of human participants in a study. Microplastics can move freely throughout the body and become stuck in organs. Scientists are still trying to understand the health effects of microplastics in the body. Microplastics are everywhere and could be linked to many diseases.
