[### Amazon ready to use its own AI chips, reduce its dependence on Nvidia (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/amazon-ready-to-use-its-own-ai-chips-reduce-its-dependence-on-nvidia/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon is already testing its Trainium 2 chips with Anthropic, Databricks, Deutsche Telekom, and Japan's Ricoh and Stockmark. Developed by Annapurna Labs, an Austin-based chip startup that Amazon acquired in early 2015, Trainum 2 is aimed at reducing Amazon's reliance on market leader Nvidia. The biggest advantage of Amazon's chips is that they use less power, which helps drive down costs. Amazon avoids making direct comparisons of its chips and doesn't submit its chips for independent performance benchmarks, but experts are confident the company's claims of a 4x performance increase between Trainum 1 and Trainium 2 are accurate.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Groundbreaking: 'Sleepy weed' shown to significantly improve sleep (5 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/sleep/cannabinol-cannabis-sleep/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cannabinol, a lesser-known component of the cannabis plant, delivers better quality and longer sleep. Cannabis folklore has suggested for decades that aged cannabis makes consumers sleepy due to the build-up of cannabinol, but this was only recently supported by scientific evidence. Cannabinol increases total sleep time with a comparable effect to zolpidem, or Ambien. It may be best suited for patients who have trouble staying asleep or experience early morning awakening insomnia because it has a delayed onset but enduring effects.

[### When muscles work out, they help neurons to grow, a new study shows (7 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2024/when-muscles-work-out-they-help-neurons-grow-1112?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

During exercise, muscles release a soup of biochemical signals called myokines that helps neurons grow. A recent study found that the repeated pulling on neurons during exercise helps them grow as much as when they are exposed to myokines. This suggests that exercise could be effective for treating nerve injuries.
