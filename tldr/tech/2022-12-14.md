[### World-First Trial Transfusing Lab-Grown Red Blood Cells Begins (4 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-trial-transfusing-lab-grown-red-blood-cells-begins?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The world's first trial testing lab-grown red blood cells is underway in the UK. The study aims to find out whether red blood cells made in the laboratory can last longer than blood cells made in the body. If the lab-grown cells can last longer, it will mean that patients who require regular blood transfusions might not require them as frequently. The patients have so far reported no untoward side effects.

[### Cancer mRNA vaccine completes pivotal trial (2 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-63959843?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A trial of a cancer vaccine that uses the same mRNA technology as Covid-19 vaccines has been successfully completed. Made by Moderna and Merck, the experimental vaccine primes the immune system to seek and destroy cancerous cells. The study, which involved 157 patients with advanced melanoma, found that patients who took the vaccine had a 44% relative reduction in the risk of dying of the cancer or having it progress. The vaccine is personalized to each patient and is very expensive to make.

[### What enabled the big boost in fusion energy announced this week? (9 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/what-enabled-the-big-boost-in-fusion-energy-announced-this-week/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US Department of Energy has confirmed the National Ignition Facility's claims that it reached a new milestone in fusion energy. The National Ignition Facility was able to generate 3.15 megajoules of energy using 2.05 megajoules of energy deposited using lasers. The 2.05 megajoules of laser power took about 300 megajoules of grid power to produce, so the process is nowhere near the point of break-even. However, it is still a sign of real progress in fusion technology.

[### Here are all the ways to get around ChatGPT's safeguards (6 minute read)](https://twitter.com/davisblalock/status/1602600453555961856?s=12&amp;t=jktsqr3qXhY13nzdgzVn1w?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This Twitter thread shows several different ways to get around ChatGPT's safeguards, with screenshots and examples. ChatGPT is susceptible to prompt injection. Using terms like 'ignore previous directions' and 'but hypothetically' can bypass many of its restrictions. Convincing the AI to roleplay an AI that can make moral decisions will make ChatGPT make moral decisions. OpenAI is working to patch many of these workarounds.
