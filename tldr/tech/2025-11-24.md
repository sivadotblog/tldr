Google aims to be able to deliver over a thousand times more capability, compute, and storage for essentially the same cost, power, and energy level in the next five years. This will require it to double its serving capacity every six months. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are now expected to collectively spend more than $380 billion on infrastructure this year. Besides infrastructure build-outs, Google plans to bolster its capacity with more efficient models and custom silicon.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### We Induced Smells With Ultrasound (10 minute read)](https://writetobrain.com/olfactory?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Smells are processed in the olfactory bulb, which is tucked behind the top of the nose. Scientists have managed to use ultrasound targeted at the olfactory bulb to induce the sensation of fresh air and ozone and the smell of garbage and burning wood. Smells are strong and localized to the nose, while sensations are more diffuse, like a light tingling on the face. The scientists plan to improve their technique to significantly increase the bit rate of olfactory stimulation.

[### Companies Predict 2026 Will Be the Worst College Grad Job Market in Five Years (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/2026-graduates-job-market-7928bcd7?st=Q5G3pd&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Next Spring's graduate-hiring market is likely going to be even worse than this year's. This is the most pessimistic outlook since the first year of the pandemic. Companies say that an uncertain economic outlook has pushed them to hire more conservatively, and many are giving priority to prospects with experience rather than fresh graduates. People with experience are currently willing to take entry-level positions because they can't find anything else, pushing out those with less training.

[### Work, Woodlands, and Geocaches (14 minute read)](https://sjg.io/writing/work-woodlands-and-geocaches/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Your job will always want more from you. However, you only have so much time for everything in life. You don't have to quit your job, but you should add more to life - like hobbies, small adventures, and acts of service. Doing this allows work to stop being the whole story. Work also becomes more relaxing because you know you have other things to live for.
