### Big Tech & Startups

[### Figma more than triples in NYSE debut after selling shares at $33 (4 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/figma-fig-starts-trading-on-nyse-after-ipo.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Figma's shares more than tripled in its New York Stock Exchange debut yesterday. The company sold shares at $33 in its initial public offering - FIG closed at $115.50. Figma ended the day with a market cap of almost $68 billion. Adobe had agreed to acquire Figma for $20 billion in 2022, but the deal fell apart after UK regulators said it would likely harm competition.

[### Coinbase says it's launching tokenized stocks, predictions markets for U.S. users in coming months (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/coinbase-to-launch-tokenized-stocks-predictions-markets-in-us-in-coming-months.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Coinbase plans to expand its core trading app to include tokenized real-world assets, stocks, derivatives, prediction markets, and early-stage token sales. These new offers will roll out first to US users in the next few months, followed by a gradual international rollout based on jurisdictional approvals. The expansion puts the exchange in even closer competition with Robinhood, Gemini, and Kraken. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently introduced an initiative to modernize securities rules and regulations to allow for crypto-based trading activity.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Google's geothermal experiments are engineering templates for the energy transition (11 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/energy/google-geothermal-engineering-energy?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Data centers are under pressure to run denser, hotter, and longer, and traditional air cooling is approaching its limit. Meeting demand now requires rethinking the entire power-thermal integration stack. Google is integrating geothermal systems directly into its next-generation data centers. If successful, the systems could help Google meet its power needs with near-constant carbon-free energy.

[### Moon's first-ever radio telescope ready for the dark side (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/space/worlds-first-lunar-radio-telescope-readies-far-side-mission/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment (LuSEE-Night) is a radio telescope that will be deployed on the far side of the Moon. The moon will act as a shield against the radio interference coming from Earth. LuSEE-Night is scheduled to launch as part of Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost 2 lunar lander mission late this year or early next. It is designed to detect the signals that are key to unlocking the secrets of the Cosmic Dark Ages, the period after the cosmic microwave background formed 380,000 years after the Big Bang and before the formation of the first stars and galaxies.

[### Our first outage from LLM-written code (5 minute read)](https://sketch.dev/blog/our-first-outage-from-llm-written-code?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sketch experienced a series of mini-outages on July 15. An LLM had made a small but critical change during a refactor that was missed by a human reviewer. When humans refactor code, they select the original text, cut it, move it to the new file, paste it, and then make intentional changes. LLMs write two patches, a deletion and an insertion, leaving room for transcription errors. Sketch added clipboard support to its agent environment to try to prevent further issues in transcription.

[### Engineering Buy-in (6 minute read)](https://venki.dev/notes/engineering-buy-in?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The best way to convince those around you to take on a project idea is to individually talk about it with many relevant people before finally pitching it to a decision-making group. Your odds of success dramatically increase if you've talked to the decision-makers in advance and have addressed their issues or incorporated their additions. Leaders need to create buy-in from their teams to maintain team morale. Getting everyone to buy in encourages autonomous collaboration and helps iteration happen quickly, but it could also lead to groupthink, exclude oppositional peers, and cause teams to misrepresent reality.

[### Ramblings (1 minute read)](https://stephango.com/ramblings?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Remote teams of two to 10 people could benefit from adding a personal 'ramblings' channel for each teammate. These channels let everyone share what's on their mind without cluttering group channels. They can be a great source for ideas, prototypes, or creative solutions to long-standing problems. They're also a great way to keep the human connection going within the company.
