Low test coverage leaves critical flows untested and slows your release velocity. Even with AI-assisted tools, teams can still struggle to reach high coverage and maintain tests as products evolve.

[### Tim Cook could step down as Apple CEO ‘as soon as next year' (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/14/tim-cook-step-down-as-apple-ceo-as-soon-as-next-year-report/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's board and senior executives have recently intensified the company's succession planning for its CEO role. John Ternus is the most likely to take the position, but no final decisions have been made. Apple is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January. The transition to a new CEO is reportedly not related to the company's current performance.

[### Group ChatGPT (7 minute read)](https://spyglass.org/group-chatgpt-social/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has launched a limited test of its chat app in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan. It will allow people to chat with AI and other people within the same environment. Group chats are separate from private conversations - personal ChatGPT memory will not be used in group chats, and ChatGPT will not create memories from group chat conversations. ChatGPT will automatically reduce exposure to sensitive content for everyone in the chat if any of the members is under 18.

[### World's oldest RNA extracted from Ice Age woolly mammoth (6 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/worlds-oldest-rna-extracted-from-ice-age-woolly-mammoth/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at Stockholm University have successfully sequenced the RNA of a young woolly mammoth discovered in 2010. This allowed them to explore new information, such as which genes were active, or whether it was infected with RNA-based viruses, when it died. The ability to recover RNA gives scientists another tool to reconstruct and validate ancient genomes. It could be used to explore how gene expression differs between extinct and living species or even between individuals of the same species.

[### Almost Everything About NASA's Latest Mission to Mars Is Unusual (12 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/science/nasa-mars-escapade.html?unlocked_article_code=1.108.ApX9.SgdCrwhWSyvI&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NASA's ESCAPADE mission, which launched on Thursday towards Mars, will collect data to provide clues about why the planet became cold, dry, and almost airless. The mission was initially rejected when it was proposed, and then it was only approved because of a federal government shutdown in 2018. The mission was delayed several times, but the lessons learned along the way could help NASA get more bang for its buck for future missions. The trajectory the mission is pioneering allows launches to be made outside of tight launch windows.

[### Building a UI Framework (Book)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qFrNa3wmeTn_HDj0C4nhGWy5T1DlF5J8zTrlhA0vEAc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.k11xahmqzzyx&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This document looks at how to create a graphical UI framework that considers developer adoption, performance, display effects, and power consumption. The most popular frameworks solve real problems. It is important to ground design in real projects with real customers, be open to new ideas, and be ready to discard inventions to go where the data leads. The most difficult part of designing a product is balancing a coherent vision with flexibility in the face of new information.

[### The fate of “small” open source (6 minute read)](https://nolanlawson.com/2025/11/16/the-fate-of-small-open-source/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The era of small, low-value libraries is over. AI can output functions from these libraries, so developers no longer have to take on extra dependencies with unknown performance, maintenance, and supply-chain risks just for basic functionalities. There is still plenty of open source to write. The most value can be found in big projects, more inventive projects, or niche areas not covered in large language model training data.

[### Meta is about to start grading workers on their AI skills (3 minute read)](https://www.aol.com/articles/meta-start-grading-workers-ai-194500326.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta plans to tie employee performance to their 'AI-driven impact' starting next year. The company will assess employees on how they use AI to deliver results and build tools that can move the needle in a major way in regards to productivity. Meta is rolling out an 'AI Performance Assistant' to help with performance reviews and feedback to use in this year's performance review cycle. Employees can also use Meta's internal assistant, Metamate, as well as Google Gemini, for their performance content.
