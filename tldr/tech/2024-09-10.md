Schizophrenia is one of the costliest mental health illnesses - it costs nearly $300 billion dollars in healthcare spending annually despite affecting less than 1% of the population. It is currently treated with antipsychotics, a treatment discovered through pure chance. Regulators are currently deciding whether to approve a drug with a novel mechanism for treating schizophrenia.

[### Design Patterns Are Temporary, Language Features Are Forever (7 minute read)](https://ptrtojoel.dev/posts/design-patterns-are-temporary/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

[### Why GitHub Actually Won (18 minute read)](https://blog.gitbutler.com/why-github-actually-won/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article, written by one of GitHub's cofounders, discusses the reasoning behind the rise and dominance of the platform. GitHub started at the right time and it had good taste. It started when distributed open source version control tools were starting to get useful, solid, and adopted and there was nobody around to host them. Its competitors couldn't compete with a developer tools company whose cofounders were all product-focused open source software developers that cared about the developer experience. Everyone else was trying to build what they thought they could sell to advertisers or CTOs.

[### DOJ claims Google has ‚Äútrifecta of monopolies‚Äù on Day 1 of ad tech trial (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/doj-claims-google-has-trifecta-of-monopolies-on-day-1-of-ad-tech-trial/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US Department of Justice's next monopoly trial against Google started on Monday. The trial challenges the tech giant's ad tech dominance. The DOJ is arguing that Google broke competition in the ad tech space by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers to facilitate digital advertising. Google profits from both advertisers and publishers, pocketing at least 30 cents of each advertising dollar flowing from advertisers to website publishers through its ad tech tools. The trial is expected to last four to six weeks and may be the most consequential of the monopoly trials Google has recently faced.

John Hering and Alexander Tamas' venture firm, Vy Capital, has invested more than half of its $8 billion in reported assets into Elon Musk's startups.
