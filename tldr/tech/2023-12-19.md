Adobe has abandoned its acquisition of product design software company Figma as there was no clear path for regulatory approval for the deal. Both UK and EU competition regulators have probed the deal due to the impact it would have on the product design, image editing, and illustration markets. Adobe will pay Figma $1 billion as a termination fee as per the terms of the merger agreement.

Apple is pausing sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 starting on December 21. The products are facing a potential import ban until August 2028 as a ruling found that they infringe on patents from Masimo. The case is now under a Presidential Review Period after which the devices will be subject to an import ban if the ruling isn't vetoed. Apple is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that the Apple Watch remains available.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### How CRISPR gene editing could help treat Alzheimer‚Äôs (4 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03931-5?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

CRISPR therapies could potentially provide a one-and-done solution for forms of Alzheimer's disease caused by genetic mutations. There are several proposed strategies for using the technology to fight Alzheimer's, but CRISPR-based gene therapies still have a long way to go. Scientists are now laying the groundwork to start bringing CRISPR technologies to clinical trials. Transformative treatments are likely only a few years away, although they will be expensive.

[### Scientists Contact Whales in World-First Communication Experiment (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-contact-whales-in-world-first-communication-experiment?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from UC Davis, the Alaska Whale Foundation, and SETI teamed up to have a 20-minute conversation with a humpback whale in her own language. The scientists played a contact call to the whale, who responded each time closely matching the intervals, indicating that the whale was engaged in an intentional exchange. The interaction had elements analogous to how we may one day be contacted by extraterrestrial beings. The scientists hope to replicate the work with other intelligent animals.

[### Zilla (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/aklivity/zilla?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Zilla is a multi-protocol, event-native proxy. It securely interfaces web apps, IoT clients, and microservices to Apache Kafka via declaratively defined, stateless APIs. Zilla has no external dependencies and does not rely on the Kafka Consumer/Producer API or Kafka Connect. It natively supports the Kafka wire protocol and uses advanced protocol mediation to establish stateless API entry points into Kafka.

[### codapi-js (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/nalgeon/codapi-js?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

codapi-js produces interactive code examples that can be embedded directly into product documentation, an online course, or a blog post. It automatically converts static code examples into mini-playgrounds that are lightweight and easy to integrate. codapi-js can create sandboxes for any programming language, database, or software. Most playgrounds require a Codapi server, but the JavaScript and Fetch playgrounds are able to work completely in the browser.

OpenAI has announced a new safety advisory group that will sit above the technical teams and make recommendations to leadership as part of an expansion of its internal safety processes to fend off the threat of harmful AI. The company has updated its Preparedness Framework to show a clear path for identifying, analyzing, and deciding what to do about catastrophic risks inherent to models they are developing. Leadership will be able to make decisions on whether to ship products, but the board has the power to reverse those decisions.
