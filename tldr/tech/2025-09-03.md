[### What a Ruling to Fix Google's Search Monopoly Means for the Company (7 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/02/technology/google-antitrust-case-ruling.html?unlocked_article_code=1.jE8.1FKV.1lhOw06IQBm1&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google is positioned to keep its Search business running largely without interruption. The company will have to share more of its data with competitors and create an oversight committee to monitor its business practices, but it can continue many of the operations that the government challenged in the antitrust lawsuit, including its payments to Apple. Google sharing its data could help its competitors improve their search products. The company will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser.

[### Anthropic raises $13 billion funding round at $183 billion valuation (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/02/anthropic-raises-13-billion-at-18-billion-valuation.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthropic has closed a $13 billion funding round at a $183 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Iconiq, Fidelity Management & Research Co., and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Anthropic will use the fresh capital to deepen safety research, meet growing enterprise demand, and support international expansion. The company's run-rate revenue recently reached more than $5 billion, up from roughly $1 billion at the beginning of the year.

[### OpenAI for Science (3 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1962938974260904421.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI for Science is a project within OpenAI aimed at building an AI-powered platform to accelerate scientific discovery. It aims to prove that AI models are ready to accelerate fundamental science and research all over the world. This thread shares several examples of how GPT-5 has helped and advanced science. More about OpenAI for Science will be unveiled in the coming months.

[### Fuel supply is a bottleneck for Starship‚Äîhere's how SpaceX will get around it (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/09/spacex-moves-closer-to-making-its-own-rocket-fuel-at-starship-launch-site/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Starship's scale dwarfs that of other rockets. It has a capacity for more than a million gallons of super-cold liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellants. While SpaceX aims to eventually be able to launch at least one Starship a day, there are numerous bottlenecks to achieving such a fast launch cadence. One of these is simple logistics: it takes more than 200 tanker trucks traveling from distant refineries to deliver all of the fuel needed for a Starship launch, which takes time, emits pollution, and clogs roadways.

[### There's a gap between AI coding demos and daily reality (15 minute read)](https://github.com/inmve/coding-with-ai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Some people may find it difficult to get the results they see others getting with AI tools. This article discusses several tools and specific techniques that have helped developers increase their productivity. These techniques are scattered across documentation, blog posts, and threads, so finding them requires knowing what to look for. The article covers requirements and planning, UI, prototyping, coding, debugging, testing, QA, and cross-stage techniques.

[### %CPU Utilization Is A Lie (5 minute read)](https://www.brendanlong.com/cpu-utilization-is-a-lie.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Viewing CPU utilization is easy - just pull up a system monitor tool. However, trying to project these numbers is a bit more difficult - whenever people try, they find that CPU utilization doesn't increase quite linearly. This happens because of hyperthreading (the cores on the machine are sharing resources with other cores) and Turbo, a dynamic processor frequency adjustment technology used to increase performance. Reported utilizations are usually an underestimate, sometimes significantly so.

### Miscellaneous

[### We only hire the trendiest (23 minute read)](https://danluu.com/programmer-moneyball/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Programmers have their own form of elitism. The industry is not that different from all the other industries that judge people based on appearance. Instead of going after 'the best' programmers, hire undistinguished workers and set them up for success. This is a lot cheaper and can produce better results.

[### Forcing Google to share secrets isn't competition (6 minute read)](https://victorwynne.com/google-search/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google has been mandated to share certain search index data and user interaction information with competitors. While many are celebrating this as a win, it could be a mistake. The decision means that Google must now share its hard-earned knowledge with competitors who haven't made the same investments or taken the same risks. These companies should succeed by creating superior experiences, not by getting a free ride on Google's research and development. Sharing this level of behavioral data also creates new opportunities for misuse. A better option would address specific anticompetitive behaviors while preserving incentives for innovation.
