[### Doctors Could Hack the Nervous System With Ultrasound (12 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/focused-ultrasound-stimulation-inflammation-diabetes?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Focused ultrasound stimulation (FUS) is a technique that involves using sound waves to reduce inflammation in targeted areas of the body. It could help with many disorders, including diabetes, obesity, arthritis, heart disease, and certain cancers. The technology offers a precise and safe way to provide healing treatments for a wide range of both acute and chronic maladies - without surgery, and potentially at home with a wearable device. This article discusses in-depth how FUS works and its potential applications.
