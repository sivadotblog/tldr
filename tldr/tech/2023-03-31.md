[### Arc‚Äôs mobile browser is here ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not really a web browser at all (8 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23662130/arc-mobile-browser-hands-on-ios?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Browser Company (TBC) has created a mobile app that brings the core feature of their Arc desktop browser to mobile phones. Arc's desktop browser features a sidebar that is a combination of bookmarking tools and an app launcher. The app is currently just the sidebar on mobile, but TBC hopes to eventually replace default browsers. The move to create a mobile app is a part of TBC's goal to create an operating system for the internet that will change how people interact with online apps and content. The app is only available on iOS for existing Arc members by invitation.

[### OpenAI treads on Tesla‚Äôs robot turf with 1X investment (6 minute read)](https://archive.is/Oqoja?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Norwegian robotics firm, 1X (previously known as Halodi), has secured $23.5 million in a Series A2 funding round led by the OpenAI Startup Fund. The funding will support the development of NEO, a bipedal android, and the scale manufacturing of EVE, 1X's humanoid security robot. This marks OpenAI's first investment in the robotics industry and could potentially put it in indirect competition with Tesla. Tesla has plans to launch a bipedal humanoid robot called the Tesla Bot or Optimus.

[### Stressed plants ‚Äòcry‚Äô ‚Äî and some animals can probably hear them (3 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00890-9?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Plants emit sounds when they are thirsty or stressed. These sounds are ultrasonic and difficult for humans to hear, but some animals might be able to detect them. Plants that have been recently cut or need water are more likely to produce these sounds. Previous research has found that plants also respond to sounds created by animals. Recordings of the sounds produced by plants are available in the article.

[### How a DNA ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô May Have Fragmented Our Genes (11 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-a-dna-parasite-may-have-fragmented-our-genes-20230330/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The discovery of a new type of 'jumping gene' could explain why genomes of complex cells are not all equally stuffed with noncoding sequences. Genes in the genomes of animals, plants, fungi, and protists are fragmented, consisting of segments, instead of long coherent strings of bases, separated by 'introns', intervening sequences that space out the DNA that encodes proteins. A recent study of genetic elements called 'introners' showed that they could act like a genomic parasite by invading genomes and producing clusters of introns in their wake. Evidence suggests that introners have been doing this in diverse eukaryotes throughout evolution.
