Oracle will oversee the security of Americans' data and monitor changes and updates to TikTok's recommendation technology under a new deal. A copy of the recommendation engine that powers the app will be licensed from China to an American investor group that will oversee the app in the US. Oracle, along with private equity firm Silver Lake, will also invest in the new American TikTok. The US-run TikTok will work to retrain the algorithm on users' data in the US. China will not have access to the data.

[### Nvidia to Invest Up to $100 Billion in OpenAI (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/nvidia-openai-100-billion-deal-data-centers-d2f85cae?st=cDga3E&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia and OpenAI have a new partnership that includes plans for an enormous data center buildout and a $100 billion investment by Nvidia into OpenAI. The deal will allow OpenAI to build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for its artificial intelligence data centers to train and run its next generation of models. It is a bet on continued model improvements that runs contrary to the view of some skeptics, who say model development is hitting a wall. Nvidia will make its investment in OpenAI progressively as each gigawatt is deployed.

[### Molten Regolith Electrolysis Could Make Moon Dust Useful (2 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/blue-origin-molten-regolith-electrolysis?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Blue Origin's Blue Alchemist is designed to transform lunar and Martian regolith into solar power systems, breathable oxygen, propellant, metals, and construction materials. Ensuring sustainability requires that missions rely on local resources to provide basic necessities. Blue Alchemist uses a molten regolith electrolysis reactor, which uses electrical current to separate oxygen from metals without water, toxic chemicals, or carbon emissions. Blue Origin is on track to scale the system to make lunar landings up to 60% cheaper and reduce fuel-cell and battery masses by up to 70%.

Karuna Therapeutics and Bristol Myers Squibb's Cobenfy pill is the first novel medication for schizophrenia in 50 years. The drug, approved by the FDA last fall, reduces symptoms like hallucinations without the adverse effects common in other antipsychotics, such as weight gain. Cobenfy's approval was the culmination of an effort that began over 15 years ago. Karuna Therapeutics and Bristol Myers Squibb Won the 2025 Gizmodo Science Fair for their research.

[### Why Local-First Apps Haven't Become Popular? (7 minute read)](https://marcobambini.substack.com/p/why-local-first-apps-havent-become?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Very few apps get offline support right because syncing is hard. Building a local-first app means effectively creating a distributed system where multiple devices can mutate data independently, sometimes offline, while still converging to the exact same state without losing data. This involves solving the challenges of unreliable ordering and conflicts. SQLite is a battle-tested, lightweight, and readily available solution for local-first apps that guarantees convergence across devices, regardless of the sync order.

[### Cloudflare's 2025 Annual Founders' Letter (9 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-2025-annual-founders-letter/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cloudflare launched in 2010 when less than 20% of the Internet was encrypted - today, well over 95% is encrypted, thanks in part to its efforts. The basic business model of the Internet for the past 15 years has been the same: create compelling content, find a way to be discovered, then generate value from the resulting traffic. There's always been a reward system that transferred value from consumers to creators. Ads were previously the only micropayment system that worked at scale to encourage an open Internet while also compensating content creators for their work, but change is being driven by AI. This article looks at how Cloudflare plans to navigate this change and what the new Internet business model will look like.

The Justice Department has asked a US District Judge to order Google to divest AdX, an advertising exchange. It claims the divestiture would enable meaningful change. Google claims that it would be a radical solution that would remove the company from the advertising-exchange business completely. Google plans to appeal the ruling that it violated the law.
