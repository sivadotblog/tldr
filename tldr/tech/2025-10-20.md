[### Is your team building or scaling AI agents? (Sponsor)](https://redis.io/resources/managing-memory-for-ai-agents/?utm_source=[name-of-provider]&amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;utm_campaign=2025-10-ai_in_production&amp;utm_content=eb-managing_memory_for_ai_agents-701N100000aRaU6)

One of AI's biggest challenges today is memory‚Äîhow agents retain, recall, and remember over time. Without it, even the best models struggle with context loss, inconsistency, and limited scalability.

[This new O'Reilly + Redis report](https://redis.io/resources/managing-memory-for-ai-agents/?utm_source=[name-of-provider]&utm_medium=cpa&utm_campaign=2025-10-ai_in_production&utm_content=eb-managing_memory_for_ai_agents-701N100000aRaU6) breaks down why memory is the foundation of scalable AI systems and how real-time architectures make it possible.

Inside the report:

* The role of short term, long term, and persistent memory in agent performance
* Frameworks and tools like LangGraph, Mem0, and Redis
* Architectural patters for faster, more reliable, context-aware systems

[### How Sam Altman Played Hollywood (11 minute read)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sam-altman-openai-sora-agencies-talent-1236401618/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI made a series of calculated moves when it released Sora. The app initially had an opt-out clause for people's likenesses to be used in clips. This caused a flood of clips using copyrighted material to be created. The company then quickly pivoted to an opt-in model. This could cause legal trouble for OpenAI in the near future.

[### The Little-Known Crypto Powerhouse Behind Billions in Trading (11 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/inside-hyperliquid-the-crypto-exchange-behind-billions-in-trades?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=copy)

Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange with an automated trading pool and token buybacks. It is a booming platform for perpetual futures, the never-expiring contracts that dominate crypto speculation. Run by a team of roughly 15 people based in Singapore, the site's front end blocks US users, but anyone can trade on the blockchain that powers it. Hyperliquid was designed with transparency in mind - every trade, liquidation, and validator action is verifiable in real time, and Hyperliquid never takes custody of user funds. Much more about the two-year-old exchange is available in the article.

[### The first non-opioid painkiller (15 minute read)](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-first-non-opioid-painkiller/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Post-operative pain relief has relied on opioids since ancient times. The FDA approved the first non-opioid pain reliever suitable for treating post-surgery pain in January. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Journavx has known of the signs of the problematic side effects associated with opioids. While the drug likely won't serve as an outright opioid replacement, it is the first step on the journey to minimizing opioid usage.

[### Why the next generation of mRNA vaccines is set to be even better (3 minute read)](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2500112-why-the-next-generation-of-mrna-vaccines-is-set-to-be-even-better/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

mRNA vaccines that code for virus-like nanoparticles produce a strong immune response while still being quick and cheap to make. Scientists at the University of Washington have shown that an mRNA version of a COVID-19 nanoparticle vaccine produces an immune response in mice that is up to 28 times higher than that of a standard mRNA vaccine. The more potent vaccine could lower side effects as patients receive lower doses. Scientists are already working on mRNA-launched nanoparticle vaccines for the flu, Epstein-Barr, and other viruses.

[### Knowledge creates technical debt (3 minute read)](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/knowledge-creates-technical-debt/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Technical debt is essentially a pile of knowledge. Everything 'bad' about the code represents what has been learned about how to do software better. Fixing that code isn't a 'debt to pay off', but an investment opportunity that will reap rewards. Skipping the opportunity to fix code is wasting the investment previously made in learning, and this could lead to a loss in revenue as competitors make the most of their knowledge.

[### Open Source is the Most Fragile and Most Resilient Ecosystem (16 minute read)](https://blog.peterzhu.ca/open-source-is-the-most-fragile-and-resilient-ecosystem/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Open source powers the internet. If it stopped being maintained by benevolent people, things would break. Companies fail, but open source is immortal. Open source will never fail to adapt to new markets because someone will force it to adapt either by contributing to it or forking it. Open source's fragility demands collective action to ensure its resilience.

[### How to sequence your DNA for &lt;$2k (5 minute read)](https://maxlangenkamp.substack.com/p/how-to-sequence-your-dna-for-2k?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The first human genome took $2.3 billion and 13 years to sequence. It now takes an Oxford Nanopore to sequence whatever DNA you want in less than 48 hours. The machine uses electrical nanopores to read the individual charge of each DNA base pair. It costs $1,000, making it possible to sequence your own DNA at home for around $1,100. Using the machine can help people avoid giving their DNA to companies and risking it being lost in a data breach.

[### Research results are cultural artifacts, not public goods (2 minute read)](https://lemire.me/blog/2025/10/17/research-results-are-cultural-artifacts-not-public-goods/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Knowledge and scientific progress are very much private goods. It's all about specific people and how they think. Cultural artifacts can and will spread, but there's nothing free about it, and it won't spread equally everywhere. The view that scientific research is a public good is a naive and indefensible view.
