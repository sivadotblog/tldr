The SEC has approved a rule change that paves the way for ETFs that buy and hold ether. The commission approved bitcoin ETFs less than six months ago - those funds have proven a big success for the industry. Many of the companies that sponsor bitcoin ETFs have already started the process of launching an ether fund. The approval of ether ETFs is a sign that the SEC's stance toward crypto may be softening. The approval for ether ETFs does not extend to other crypto projects on the Ethereum network.
