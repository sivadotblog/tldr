### Big Tech & Startups

[### Blue Origin Lands Booster After Rocket Launch and Matches SpaceX's Feat (7 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/science/blue-origin-launch-rocket.html?unlocked_article_code=1.1E8.XjHA.KuDIU_o5Dzes&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Blue Origin nailed the landing of its New Glenn rocket booster yesterday. It is the second company to successfully accomplish the feat. New Glenn's two successful launches in a row could win it a sizable slice of the business of sending stuff to space. The New Glenn booster is considerably bigger and heavier than SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster.

[### Apple Aims to Capitalize on Mini App Trend With New Program (4 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/apple-aims-to-capitalize-on-mini-app-trend-with-new-program?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzEwMDA1NywiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzA0ODU3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNU9ETFFUOU5KTFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.13Zex3FGgZm_assNEcQx7fZehQkShQLj7602WEU5b44&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's new Mini Apps Partner program gives Apple a 15% cut of in-app purchases for mini apps and games within larger 'super apps'. Mini app creators have been using loopholes to avoid Apple's in-app payments framework. The new program should help lock those software creators into Apple's preferred approach and guarantee more revenue for the company. Mini apps or games must be released by a party not directly or indirectly controlled by the developer of the dominant app to qualify for the new program.

[### Android Dreams (43 minute read)](https://android-dreams.ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Trying to predict the future is an excellent feedback mechanism for developing a world model in areas you care about. You can review your predictions to see what you got wrong and why. This site presents a timeline for AI development that predicts that a continuously improving AI that learns from interactions in the real world, with the potential to become more expert at most tasks than even humans with 40 years of experience, won't be developed until after 2045. Winning robotics is a national security issue - technology that gives its owner access to users and resources at scale is a threat. There will be a diversity of robot form factors in the future.

[### Biohub for Non-Biologists: Behind Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg's plan to cure all diseases (68 minute read)](https://www.latent.space/p/biohub?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Biohub has a billion dollars a year to make several long-horizon bets on basic science. Its aim is to change our understanding of immunological science and open up the door to engineering human health, simulating immune therapies, reprogramming dysfunctional cells, and preventing diseases before they arise. It has opened up three models on its virtual cells platform: VariantFormer, a model that directly translates personal genetic variations into tissue-specific gene activity patterns; CryoLens, a large-scale model for cryoET that provides unsupervised structural similarity analysis; and scLDM, a model that can generate realistic single-cell data in silico at unprecedented fidelity. A transcript of an interview with Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, where they discuss the Biohub secret master plan, is available in the article.

[### Generative UI SDK for Flutter (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/flutter/genui?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

GenUI (Generative UI SDK for Flutter) is a Flutter library that lets developers easily add interactive generative UI to their applications. It is designed to help developers replace static walls of text from large language models with dynamic and interactive graphical UIs. It can turn conversations and agent interactions into rich, intuitive experiences. State changes in the UI are fed back to the agent, creating a high-bandwidth interaction loop.

[### Introducing GPT-5.1 for developers (11 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1-for-developers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has released GPT-5.1 on its API platform. The model can dynamically adapt how much time it spends thinking based on the complexity of tasks, making it significantly faster and more token-efficient on simpler everyday tasks. It features a 'no reasoning' mode to respond faster on tasks that don't require deep thinking. OpenAI has extended prompt caching for up to 24 hours to drive faster responses for follow-up questions at a lower cost. Priority Processing customers will experience notably faster performance with GPT-5.1 over GPT-5.
