Apple is working on a new home accessory. The accessory's internal identifier name suggests that it will receive Apple's upcoming A18 chip, which means it will have the power for Apple Intelligence. The home accessory will likely run a software variant of tvOS. Apple may be launching an updated Apple TV later this year.

[### A Hacker Stole OpenAI Secrets, Raising Fears That China Could, Too (8 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/04/technology/openai-hack.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4k0.8GOs.WFzxVAjkpQLt&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A hacker gained access to OpenAI's internal messaging systems early last year. They accessed details from discussions in an internal online forum but did not get into the systems where the company houses and builds its artificial intelligence. Details of the incident were revealed to employees in April 2023. Executives decided not to share the news publicly because no information about customers or partners was stolen. It is believed that the hacker was a private individual with no known ties to a foreign government. OpenAI did not inform the FBI or anyone else in law enforcement about the incident.

[### Japan introduces enormous humanoid robot to maintain train lines (2 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/04/japan-train-robot-maintain-railway-lines?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Japan Railway's new humanoid robot employee is being put to use for maintenance work on the company's rail network. The 12-meter-high robot can carry objects as heavy as 40kg, hold a brush to paint, and use a chainsaw. Its current primary tasks are to trim tree branches along rails and paint the metal frames that hold cables above trains. The technology is aimed at filling worker shortages in the aging country as well as reducing worker accidents.

[### Apple M5 Chip's Dual-Use Design Will Power Future Macs and AI Servers (1 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/apple-m5-chips-advanced-packaging-tsmc/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple will reportedly use a more advanced System on Integrated Chip (SoIC) technology for its M5 chips. SoIC technology allows for the stacking of chips in a three-dimensional structure. It provides better electrical performance and thermal management compared to traditional two-dimensional chip designs. Apple intends to start mass producing the chips in 2025 and 2026 for new Macs and AI cloud servers. The M5's dual-use design is believed to be part of Apple's plans to vertically integrate its supply chain for AI functionality across computers, cloud servers, and software.

[### Against Innovation Tokens (21 minute read)](https://blog.glyph.im/2024/07/against-innovation-tokens.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The idea of using innovation tokens to identify which technologies are innovative implies that everyone knows which technologies are innovative. It also assumes that innovative technologies are inherently costly and that their supply should be restricted. This model is reactionary and borders on anti-intellectualism. It is better to look at whether using a particular technology will introduce a boundary between two different technologies with different conceptual models.
