[### The expanding world of genetic testing for your embryos (5 minute read)](https://jordanagraifman.substack.com/p/the-expanding-world-of-genetic-testing?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is testing performed on embryos before implantation for the purposes of gathering genetic information to guide embryo selection during IVF. It is considered a low-risk procedure when performed by experienced professionals. This article looks at what can and can't be learned from the genetic testing of embryos and the different types of testing available today. PGT results should only be seen as screening and not a perfect diagnosis. While it is powerful, it is only useful if it is understood and applied properly.

[### Tech Debt? I don't believe it exists (4 minute read)](https://dadrian.io/blog/posts/tech-debt/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

One way to approach tech debt is to treat it like it doesn't exist and instead focus on things that are causing problems now, things that will be causing problems soon, and things that are not causing problems. Sometimes people want to schedule tech debt in - this is an anti-pattern that indicates you don't actually know what your problems are, where you want to go, and why you want to go there. Getting a handle on tech debt is about working on the right problems, at the right time, for the right reasons.

Anthropic was dominating the AI coding space and had a consistently better model than OpenAI for almost two years. OpenAI's response was to set the entire business model on fire and move to a different arena. By releasing GPT-5, a model with the same performance benchmarks as Claude on coding, at a cost of $10 per million tokens, every application layer company that was previously dependent on Anthropic's price point switched overnight. The move signals OpenAI's willingness to prevent the AI coding market from existing.
