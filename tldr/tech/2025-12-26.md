Google is gradually rolling out the option to change a Gmail address to a new one (up to three times) with an altered username.

The support page detailing the update is currently only in Hindi.

OpenAI has quietly rolled out a new feature that tweaks ChatGPT's layout to match the UI of the task it is supposed to execute. The new 'formatting box' mini editor toolbar pops up when users highlight text inside ChatGPT's newer rich-text areas. It shows drafts as formatted documents so users can edit them as they would in any document editor. A screenshot of the feature is available in the article.

Perseverance arrived on Mars nearly five years ago. At the time, NASA had planned a mission to retrieve samples collected by the rover as soon as 2026, but now, no such mission is set to launch until the 2030s. Perseverance appears to be in good condition and should be able to operate for many years to come. The rover will continue filling sample tubes in the expectation that they will eventually come back to Earth.

[### URL Pattern API (17 minute read)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The URL Pattern API defines a syntax that is used to create URL pattern matchers. Patterns are specified using the URLPattern interface with a pattern syntax based on the syntax from the path-to-regexp library. They can contain capturing groups that extract parts of the matched URL. The API works across all of the latest devices and browser versions.

Ruby 4.0 introduces Ruby Box and ZJIT and adds many improvements. Ruby Box is a feature that provides separations about definitions. Definitions loaded in a box are isolated in the box. ZJIT is a new just-in-time compiler developed to raise the performance ceiling and encourage more outside contributions. It is faster than the interpreter, but not yet as fast as YJIT.

[### When robot taxis get stuck, a secret army of humans comes to the rescue (6 minute read)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/when-robot-taxis-get-stuck-a-secret-army-of-humans-comes-to-the-rescue/ar-AA1T0Xwv?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Waymo vehicles become stranded if a human doesn't close the door behind them at the end of a ride. Riders and passerbys are unreliable, so Waymo summons help through an app called Honk, paying workers $20 or more for rescuing a robotaxi by closing a door. Last weekend's power outage in San Francisco resulted in a severe gridlock throughout the city, causing a flurry of requests for tow-truck companies to retrieve Waymo vehicles. These are examples of how, as automation advances, it can create new work for humans to fix errors.

[### Amazon faces ‘leader's dilemma' — fight AI shopping bots or join them (7 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/24/amazon-faces-a-dilemma-fight-ai-shopping-agents-or-join-them.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon is using its subsidiaries to experiment with shopping agents as it continues to contemplate how to deal with them. While the company may be willing to let agents access its catalog, it likely wants to protect more valuable data, such as reviews, from its competitors. Its homegrown AI tools have improved since they first launched. Amazon is now testing an agent that can purchase products from other sites directly in its e-commerce app.
