The change is aimed at bringing consistency to the company's branding and making things less confusing to customers and developers. The next operating systems will be known as iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. The shift will be announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9.

[### A Reaction to Alzheimer's Fraud (4 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/reaction-alzheimer-s-fraud?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The beta-amyloid protein has been a prime suspect in the pathology of Alzheimer's for many decades. However, there was a period where some papers made a form of amyloid appear to be able to induce disease-like symptoms all by itself in rodent models. Those works turned out not to be reproducible, and there is strong evidence of deliberately faked work in those papers. While those particular papers are fake, they don't discount the decades of legitimate research on the topic.

[### Researchers Say New Contact Lenses Let You See in the Dark (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/new-contact-lenses-see-dark?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have created contact lenses that allow people to see in the dark with the help of infrared light. The invention could allow colorblind people to see colors again. The contacts don't require an external power source and wearers can perceive multiple infrared wavelengths even with their eyes closed. They aren't yet able to capture fine details, so the scientists are working on a version with more precise spatial resolution and higher sensitivity.

[### One of the reasons I'm finding LLMs so much more useful for coding than a lot of people (1 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/28/automated-tests/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

All of Simon Willison's code has automated tests. This massively de-risks his use of large language models. He uses AI to write code and then proves that code works with tests, then uses AI to refactor the code until it looks good, keeping the tests green the whole time. Programmers who find the technology to be more of a hindrance than a help in their work may need to check the health of their test suites.

[### As a developer, my most important tools are a pen and a notebook (3 minute read)](https://hamatti.org/posts/as-a-developer-my-most-important-tools-are-a-pen-and-a-notebook/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A notebook is the most important tool to have as a software developer. While writing code is a necessary part of the job, more important than writing that code is figuring out what code to write. Writing and sketching are powerful tools for thinking through problems and they can help turn vague abstract ideas into tangible artifacts. Using a notebook also leaves behind a copy of your thoughts and the process of how you reached them.

OpenAI and a group of American technology giants recently won a deal to build one of the world's largest artificial intelligence data centers in Abu Dhabi. While the deal was being made, Elon Musk worked hard to make sure it included his own AI startup, warning the group that the plan had no chance of presidential approval unless xAI was included in the deal. Trump and US officials reviewed the deal terms and decided to move forward. The project, Stargate UAE, was ultimately announced on May 22.

As humans, we like to think our minds are somehow at the top of what's possible, but it is now pretty clear this isn't true. Artificial neural networks allow us to get a more systematic sense of what different scales of brains can do. As systems get more complex, they may start using abstractions and higher-order constructs that we are basically blind to.
