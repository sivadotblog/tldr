The Space Launch System rocket program is now a decade and a half old. It has so far cost US taxpayers more than $30 billion. The program continues to be plagued with issues. NASA's new administrator has acknowledged the low flight rate issue, saying that it should be a topic of discussion.

[### First-ever experimental gene therapy seeks to restore vision by rejuvenating eye neurons (5 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/health/life-biosciences-er100-epigenetic-vision-therapy?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

ER-100 is an experimental gene therapy designed to restore vision by reviving damaged neurons in the eye. The approach resets aged retinal cells to a healthier state using epigenetic reprogramming. It received FDA approval for human trials last week. If successful, ER-100 could signal a broader shift in how age-related diseases are treated.

[### Agentic Engineering (7 minute read)](https://addyosmani.com/blog/agentic-engineering/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Agentic engineering is a professional term that describes what is actually happening: the engineer orchestrates AI agents as they act as an architect, reviewer, and decision maker. It is a serious engineering discipline that involves autonomous agents. The term definitely sounds better than 'vibe coding' in professional settings. Agentic engineering disproportionately benefits senior engineers who understand system design, security patterns, and performance tradeoffs. They know what good code looks like, so they can efficiently review and correct AI output.

LLM-based reasoning is both powerful and flexible. However, there is likely still room to make the recipe even simpler. There are also still more gains to be had by understanding all the plays in which thinking behavior can be found. The extra reasoning data generated over recent years may help further train models to reason better through previously unviable methods.

[### OpenClaw is What Apple Intelligence Should Have Been (3 minute read)](https://www.jakequist.com/thoughts/openclaw-is-what-apple-intelligence-should-have-been?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mac Minis are selling out everywhere because people are using them to run OpenClaw, an open source framework for local AI agents that has become a killer app for Mac hardware. The rush shows that there is a clear demand for agents and automation, and Apple is getting the hardware revenue from it. However, it's missing out on the platform revenue - Apple could have created its own native agent, but this would likely have caused significant legal issues.
