[### Human-rat brain hybrid shows a way to cure blindness (3 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/health/human-mini-brains?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Research has demonstrated that human-derived mini brains can integrate with damaged rat brains and perform functions related to sight. The visual cortex can be damaged by injury or disease, resulting in loss of sight. Scientists have speculated that grafting brain organoids constructed from lab-grown cells onto a damaged visual cortex could restore vision. Previous studies have established that baby rat brains can accept and incorporate grafts from human mini brains. While the new research shows that the human-derived mini brain grafts can respond to stimulation in rats, there is a chance that humans would respond to the procedure in a completely different way.
