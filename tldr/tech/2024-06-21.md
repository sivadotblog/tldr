Dell announced a return-to-office initiative earlier this year that involved workers having to classify themselves as remote or hybrid. Those who chose to classify themselves as remote had to agree that they could no longer be promoted or hired into new roles within the company. Nearly 50% of Dell's workforce opted to stay remote. Many interviewed employees admitted that they were looking for work at other companies that weren't trying to force employees back to the office. Many other companies are struggling to restore in-person work.

Anthropic's newest model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is reportedly equal to or better than OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini across a wide variety of tasks.

Anthropic is introducing a new feature called Artifacts that will allow users to see, interact with, and edit the results of their Claude requests.

[### Why Americans aren't buying more EVs (14 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/why-americans-arent-buying-more-evs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Electric vehicles are still too expensive to be accessible to millions of Americans. High prices, high interest rates, and concerns over driving range and charging infrastructure have chilled buyers' enthusiasm, even among those who consider themselves green. The US government has set policies that hit Chinese manufacturers of cars, batteries, and other components with punitive taxes. It also restricts federal tax incentives for consumers buying Chinese products. While the laws aim to allow the US to develop its own supply chains, analysts say such protectionism will result in higher EV prices for US consumers in the meantime and slow down EV adoption in the US.

[### Ask HN: Could AI be a dot com sized bubble? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40739431&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While generative AI will likely be incredibly important in the future, there seems to be a lot of high expectations of how useful it can be in the near future, and ideas around business models are fuzzy like in the dot com era. If these near-future expectations don't pan out, companies could slow down their R&D expenditures, leading to a sizable stock market correction. There are clear differences between AI and the dot com bubble, so the comparison doesn't exactly hold.
