[### Internet blimps are coming to Zanzibar. But can a UK company succeed where Google failed? (4 minute read)](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/01/12/africa/world-mobile-internet-balloon-zanzibar-spc-intl/index.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Tanzanian islands of Zanzibar and Pemba will soon be a test site for a network of tethered blimp-like balloons that will provide near-blanket internet coverage across the islands. Only 20% of Tanzanians use the internet due to limited coverage, high data costs, and low digital literacy. The helium-filled balloons will float 300 meters high and have a broadcast range of around 700 kilometers. They will be able to stay airborne for 2 weeks before needing to be refueled. A ground network will be constructed to provide Wi-Fi. The first balloon will launch in June.

[### China Building ‚ÄúArtificial Moon‚Äù Facility That Simulates Low Gravity With Magnets (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/the-byte/china-artificial-moon-magnets?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese researchers are developing a facility to simulate the gravity of the lunar surface. The artificial Moon will be built in only a few months. It will create low gravity environments using a vacuum chamber and a powerful magnetic field. The chamber will only be 60 centimeters in diameter, but that will be big enough for researchers to test certain equipment and tools to see how they react to the Moon's low-gravity environment. The artificial Moon was inspired by an experiment that earned a Russian physicist an Ig Nobel Prize in Physics.
