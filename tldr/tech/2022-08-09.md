[### Gigantic "Jet" Lightning Bolt That Reached Edge of Space Puzzles Scientists (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/the-byte/jet-lightning-bolt-space?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A gigantic jet lightning bolt recorded over Oklahoma in May 2018 carried 100 times as much charge as an average lightning bolt and reached 50 miles into the air, almost to the official boundary of outer space. These types of lightning bolts remain a mystery to scientists as they occur so rarely. The bolt in 2018 was recorded using cutting-edge mapping technologies. It was mapped in three dimensions with really high-quality data, allowing the scientists to see the phenomenon with a new level of detail.

[### Giant Viruses Called 'Jumbo Phages' Could Help Us Fight Antibiotic Resistance (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/strange-jumbo-phage-biology-may-help-us-to-tackle-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Jumbo phages are viruses, named for their large genomes, that infect bacteria. Some jumbo phages are able to grow a shield around their genetic material, preventing bacterial immune systems from attacking their DNA. These protective casings are constructed from a single type of protein called chimallin. They can selectively allow molecules to pass through and grow as the phage's genome replicates. Research into these barriers could help scientists develop better therapies against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

This Hacker News thread talks about trends that few people are talking about. The top replies discuss preimplantation polygenetic testing (genetically screening embryos before implantation), issues with abandoning internal combustion engine vehicles (there are still many problems to solve to make the switch to electric cars sustainable), and deglobalization (countries dependent on imported food or energy need to look for more sustainable solutions).

[### Taiwan chip industry emerges as battlefront in U.S.-China showdown (12 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/taiwan-china-chips/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Taiwan has become indispensable to both the US and China due to its ability to fabricate advanced semiconductors. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd (TSMC) has technology crucial to cutting-edge digital devices and weapons. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would threaten US military and technological leadership. Both the US and China are spending billions to break their dependency on TSMC's Taiwanese foundries. This could affect Taiwan's future position in the global supply chain.
