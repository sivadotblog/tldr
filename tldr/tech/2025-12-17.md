Warner Bros. plans to reject Paramount's hostile takeover bid due to concerns about financing and other terms. The board will urge shareholders to reject the tender offer.

[### Sawing a Dam in Half (on Purpose) (18 minute read)](https://practical.engineering/blog/2025/12/16/sawing-a-dam-in-half-on-purpose?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Fontana Dam started showing cracks in 1972, caused by concrete expansion. Engineers decided to give the concrete more room to grow rather than patching cracks as they appeared. They cut a relief slot all through the dam without draining the reservoir or causing any disruptions to the hydropower plant. This post explains how this was achieved. A video showing footage of the procedure is available.

[### If AI could interact and learn from the physical world, could it make more scientific advances? (3 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/2000977815672643908.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI partnered with Red Queen Bio to introduce a new evolutionary framework that uses GPT-5 to optimize cloning protocols. The project involved the pilot of an autonomous robot to carry out the protocols. GPT-achieved a 79x cloning efficiency gain and introduced a new enzyme-based approach. While this is not a bio breakthrough, the novel optimization shows that GPT-5 is at the level of a competent PhD student at this task.

It will allow users to watch Instagram Reels' short-form, user-generated videos on bigger screens. Social video is increasingly capturing big-screen attention, with platforms like YouTube gaining more watch time on TV than anything else.

[### Messaging is a Moat, not a Business (5 minute read)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgcRLmPyyvExFYqBfBKKXsHVas12h4LtWfULzM5B5Go/edit?tab=t.0&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Messaging platforms command astronomical acquisition prices, but they often flounder when left to stand alone in the public markets. Messaging is perhaps the most valuable loss leader in digital history. It creates massive utility, commands unparalleled user attention, and offers high retention, but captures almost no direct financial value of its own.
