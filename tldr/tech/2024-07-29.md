[### Apple Intelligence Delayed to iOS 18.1 in October (1 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/28/report-apple-intelligence-delayed-to-ios-18-1/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple Intelligence is being delayed to give Apple more time to fix bugs. The company now plans to start rolling out the feature several weeks after the launch of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. There is concern about the stability of the feature and developers need more testing time. Apple Intelligence will still be made available to software developers as soon as next week with the first betas of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1.

[### The $600 Billion Digital Ad Business Is Hanging on a Few Words From Google (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/the-600-billion-digital-ad-business-is-hanging-on-a-few-words-from-google-6b9fc4f5?mod=tech_lead_pos3&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google plans to introduce a prompt asking users to opt in or out of cookies in Chrome. The company's choice of wording for the prompt could have widespread implications for the industry. It could result in cookies being effectively deprecated because consumers opt out. Google still plans to develop and test its Privacy Sandbox, a suite of alternative technologies to the cookie.

[### Seventh patient ‘cured' of HIV: why scientists are excited (6 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02463-w?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A 60-year-old man in Germany is the seventh person with HIV to be announced free of the virus after receiving a stem-cell transplant. The patient received stem cells which only had one copy of a gene that has been suggested as the best target for an HIV cure. The findings widen the donor pool for stem-cell transplants - roughly 1% of people of European descent carry mutations in both copies of the gene, while 10% of people carry one mutated copy. The procedure, which is risky and offered to people with leukemia, is unlikely to be rolled out for most individuals with HIV.

[### Solid-state batteries are finally making their way out of the lab (10 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/hard-tech/future-of-solid-state-batteries?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article takes a look at the history of batteries, the latest breakthroughs, and the trends that suggest that solid-state batteries could soon overtake lithium-ion ones. Battery design hasn't changed much since the first battery in 1799 - solid-state batteries have been the major exception. Their development has been held back by cost, manufacturing challenges, and a tendency for them to short-circuit. Solid-state batteries seem to finally be ready to deliver on their promise, with several companies getting ready to or already releasing products containing the technology.

[### The New Internet (16 minute read)](https://tailscale.com/blog/new-internet?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article discusses the big vision for Tailscale. The tech industry has evolved into a mess, making things harder for developers. While almost all devices are now supercomputers compared to the standards of 20 years ago, they become useless once you turn off AWS. This centralization is caused by a lack of connectivity. Tailscale aims to increase connectivity by creating a new Internet that works how you thought the Internet worked, before you learned how the Internet works. Its network slices out layers of nonsense so that every device can connect securely and safely and be a peer without adding latency or overhead.
