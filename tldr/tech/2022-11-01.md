[### Elon Musk Planning Vine Reboot After Twitter Acquisition (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-twitter-vine-reboot/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Twitter engineers have been tasked with creating an updated version of Vine that could launch before the end of the year. The company acquired Vine back in 2012 but shut it down in 2016. Elon Musk tweeted a poll asking if he should bring back Vine and 69.5% of the respondents said yes. A rebooted version of Vine could compete with TikTok.

[### Meta Myths (15 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2022/meta-myths/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Facebook is not losing users - it is still adding millions of users around the world, and people aren't leaving the platform. TikTok is only depressing growth on Instagram, not reversing it. Reels is growing and its growth is preventing users from leaving the platform for TikTok. There are still plenty of ads on Facebook, mostly from newer online companies. Meta's spending is necessary and its investments are likely to pay off in the long run.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists use mRNA technology to create a potent flu vaccine that could last for years (6 minute read)](https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/new-mrna-vaccine-universal-flu-shot?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have developed an mRNA-based influenza vaccine that could provide years of protection. The vaccine targets four viral proteins that are common across different strains of influenza. It was shown to be effective in mice with no previous contact with the virus. Pre-existing immunity against the flu may impact the quality of the vaccine's antibody response.

[### Molten salt reactors could save nuclear power (7 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/environment/molten-salt-reactor-52913?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Today's nuclear plants use water to capture heat from the fuel. The water is heated to high temperatures and pressurized to prevent it from turning into steam. The high pressure increases the likelihood of a leak, which could result in the fuel overheating. Molten salt remains liquid at temperatures as high as 2,500 F without any pressurization. Replacing water with molten salt could potentially result in cheaper, safer, more reliable, and more efficient nuclear reactors.

[### Ask HN: What was being a software developer like about 30 years ago? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33403174)

Being a developer 30 years ago was great. Systems were smaller so most people could understand them better. It was much more difficult to update things, so developers were more careful about releases. Hardware limitations prevented any work from home, so the work/life balance was better. There were fewer cyberattacks, so security was much less of a concern.
