[### Elon Musk just gave another Mars speech ‚Äî this time the vision seems tangible (6 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/elon-musk-just-gave-another-mars-speech-this-time-the-vision-seems-tangible/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk gave a 45-minute speech at SpaceX's Starbase facility in South Texas last weekend about making life multiplanetary, the booster for Starship, the upper stage, and SpaceX's plans to ultimately deliver millions of tons of cargo to Mars for a self-sustaining civilization. SpaceX has now completed 327 successful launches, with 80% of those involving used boosters. This performance has given Musk confidence that reusability can be achieved with the Super Heavy booster that powers Starship. While SpaceX's goals seem audacious, the company has proven that rocket reusability is a very viable thing, so its other goals appear a lot more achievable.

[### A secret climate experiment in Alameda (7 minute read)](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-climate/2024/04/04/a-secret-climate-experiment-in-alameda-00150705?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A group of scientists launched a stream of microscopic salt particles off the deck of a decommissioned aircraft carrier last Tuesday in Alameda, California, as part of an experiment to limit global warming by increasing cloud cover to reflect sunlight away from Earth. Very few people knew about the project beforehand as geoengineering projects are controversial and the team was concerned that critics would try to stop them. The experiment will run through the end of May, and visitors are able to view the experiment.

[### How can I accelerate my personal growth? (3 minute read)](https://twitter.com/auren/status/1777394634148208684?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Growing quickly requires a job that surrounds you with people who are smarter than you and gives you opportunities to fail, with a company that has a history of giving massive responsibility to people similar to you. Choose companies that are selective with hiring and target positions where success is not guaranteed. Look for people in the company who have similar profiles as you and see if they have been given outsized responsibility in the company to see if you have a chance to get promoted quickly. These selection criteria are heavily weighted towards startups.

[### Notes on how to use LLMs in your product (17 minute read)](https://lethain.com/mental-model-for-how-to-use-llms-in-products/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It's easy to make an argument that large language models can improve internal efficiency in companies somehow. It's much harder to describe a believable way for them to make products more useful to customers. This article discusses ways to meaningfully integrate large language models into existing products. It covers how to think about the technology, revamping workflows, different ways to implement models, and more. The article also covers potential issues such as copyright law, data processing agreements, and provider availability.
