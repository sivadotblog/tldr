[### Google‚Äôs best Gemini demo was faked (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/googles-best-gemini-demo-was-faked/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The video demonstrating some of Google Gemini's best interactions may not be entirely real. While Gemini appears to be able to do the things that Google shows in the video, it isn't able to do them live and in the way the video implies. The video was a series of carefully tuned text prompts with still images selected to mislead viewers about the speed, accuracy, and fundamental mode of interaction with the model. A breakdown of the video is available in the article.

[### Defying Cavity: Lantern Bioworks FAQ (18 minute read)](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/defying-cavity-lantern-bioworks-faq?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=89120&amp;post_id=139373544&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=17m06t&amp;utm_medium=email)

Lantern Bioworks claims to have a cure for tooth decay. It has a genetically modified bacterium designed to infect patients' mouths to outcompete tooth-decay-causing bacteria, making cavities a thing of the past. One treatment with the bacteria is enough to infect users' mouths forever. This article contains an interview with Lantern founder Aaron Silverbook where he explains how the technology works, both in a biological and economic sense.

[### China launches world‚Äôs ‚Äòmost advanced‚Äô nuclear reactor that‚Äôs cooled by gas, not water (2 minute read)](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/china-nuclear-reactor-gas-water-b2459952.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China has begun operations at a nuclear reactor that uses gas rather than water for cooling. Construction of the plant started in 2012 and its first reactor was connected to the country's power grid in 2021. Interest in gas-cooled reactors is increasing globally as they can provide efficient and cost-effective electricity. They can also produce high-temperature process heat for industrial applications. Pictures of the power plant are available in the article.

The criteria to be listed on these search engines is strict as sites with more formal contexts (eg business sites) aren't allowed. This article takes a look at some of these Japanese personal websites and compares them to similar sites from the West. The Personal Web is still very alive in the East, with many sites surviving for over a decade or two.

[### Journey to the birthplace of the ELT, the largest optical telescope in the world: ‚ÄòIt will be a revolution‚Äô (8 minute read)](https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-12-04/journey-to-the-birthplace-of-the-elt-the-largest-optical-telescope-in-the-world-it-will-be-a-revolution.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will be the largest telescope on the planet that is able to detect visible and infrared light. It is the flagship project of the European Southern Observatory, an organization that comprises 16 countries. The telescope will allow scientists to see even the first galaxies from the dawn of the universe in greater detail. It will allow scientists to map the orbits of faraway stars in three dimensions and allow them to start developing theories based on three-dimensional models.
