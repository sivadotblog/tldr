Every day we hear from companies who are disappointed because their MSPs:

* Lack proactivity, resulting in little improvement over time
* Continuously charge more and sometimes for every change
* Offer no security visibility, keeping C-level executives up at night

[### Elon Musk's Boring Company reveals Prufrock TBM's most disruptive feature (3 minute read)](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-boring-company-prufrock-most-disruptive-feature/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Boring Company's Prufrock-5 tunnel boring machine (TBM) will begin tunneling by December 1. One of the key features of the Prufrock machines is that they can be retrieved, upgraded, and deployed again with improvements. Standard TBMs are often left underground at the end of projects because retrieving them is usually too expensive and impractical. TBMs from the Boring Company could eventually be as reusable as SpaceX's boosters.

[### Mapping the Sense of What's Going On Inside (10 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/science/brain-neuroscience-interoception.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E8.7zme.rZ2NBgYCzl6C&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Interoception is a sense that supplies the brain with a remarkably rich picture of what is happening throughout the body. It shapes our emotions, behavior, decisions, and feelings. A growing body of research suggests that many psychiatric conditions may be caused in part by errors in our perception of our internal environment. Scientists still need to develop a firm understanding of how interoception works, but someday it may be possible to treat some conditions by returning a person's internal sense.

[### Brain has five ‘eras', scientists say – with adult mode not starting until early 30s (4 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The brain experiences five major phases, split up by four pivotal turning points (at around the ages of nine, 32, 66, and 83 years) in which brain organization moves on to a different trajectory. Understanding the brain's structural journey helps scientists identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption. It could also give insights into risk factors for mental health disorders, which most frequently emerge during the adolescent period. An overview of the five stages is available in the article.
