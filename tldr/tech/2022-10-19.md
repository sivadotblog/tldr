[### We‚Äôre investigating a potential lawsuit against GitHub Copilot for violating its legal duties to open-source authors and end users (8 minute read)](https://githubcopilotinvestigation.com/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

GitHub Copilot is being investigated for a potential lawsuit for violating its legal duties to open-source authors and end users. The vast majority of open-source software, which Copilot is trained on, is released under licenses that require preserving accurate attribution of the source code and other obligations. Microsoft and OpenAI have not published any attributions and it is debatable whether training its AI on the code is fair use. Reproducing identifiable code could pose a problem for developers who don't know they are using licensed code. More details on the lawsuit and information on how to participate in it are available on the site.
