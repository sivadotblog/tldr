[### SpaceX Starship moved to launchpad for 6th flight test (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/14/spacex_starship_flight_test/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX's Starship has been transported to a launchpad in preparation for a scheduled flight test on November 18. SpaceX has already performed a static fire, so launch preparations should only involve checkouts, filling the tanks with fuel, and lighting the engines. The sixth test flight will be similar to the fifth - there are a few changes, but not enough to require modifications to the launch license. Bigger changes are planned for the seventh flight test, including larger propellant tanks and a new generation of thermal protection tiles.

[### The 'morphing' wheel from South Korea that may transform lives and robots (2 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/morphing-wheel-south-korea-that-may-transform-lives-robots-2024-11-14/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials have developed a morphing wheel that can roll over obstacles up to 1.3 times the height of its radius. The wheel's spokes automatically adjust their stiffness to the terrain, allowing them to navigate all manner of obstacles, including curbs and staircases. The technology could be used for many applications, including unmanned delivery vehicles, wheelchairs, and movement in industrial settings. The researchers aim to make the wheels viable for speeds up to 100 kilometers per hour.

OpenAI's containerized ChatGPT environment lets users interact with the model's underlying structure. OpenAI uses a Debian-based sandbox environment to run ChatGPT code. The environment's internal directory structures can be exposed and manipulated using simple prompt injections, but this is intentional rather than a security gap. OpenAI appears to draw the line at breaking out of the containerized environment.

[### Something weird is happening with LLMs and chess (11 minute read)](https://dynomight.net/chess/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This post looks at different AI models' performance at playing chess. Almost all large language models (LLMs) are terrible at chess except gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct. It is unknown what is causing this, but it may be due to different training data, the quality of training data, the effects of instruction tuning, or there may be something particular about different transformer structures. This may explain why people got good results with LLMs and chess two years ago and why the field has been quiet since.

[### Google is facing the threat of government regulators supervising its financial services (2 minute read)](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-cfpb-oversight-3499864/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google may soon be placed under formal federal supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is tasked with keeping financial institutions accountable to consumers. Google handles a lot of funds that it doesn't own and the CFPB has received hundreds of complaints over the years from consumers experiencing problems with billing through Google. Google has reportedly been pushing back as hard as it can against the inquiry as if things move forward, the bureau could gain unprecedented access to internal company records.
