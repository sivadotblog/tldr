[### World's smallest particle accelerator is 54 million times smaller than the Large Hadron Collider ‚Äî and it works (3 minute read)](https://www.space.com/worlds-smallest-particle-accelerator-nanophotonic?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new particle accelerator known as a nanophotonic electron accelerator is around the size of a small coin. The device consists of a small microchip that houses an even smaller vacuum tube made up of thousands of individual pillars. Researchers can accelerate electrons by firing mini laser beams at these pillars. The main goal of creating these devices is to use the energy given off by the accelerated electrons in targeted medical treatments that can replace damaging forms of radiotherapy.
