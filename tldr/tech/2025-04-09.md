[### How Trump's TikTok Negotiations Were Upended by China and Tariffs (5 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/technology/trump-tiktok-china-tariffs.html?unlocked_article_code=1.-U4.YQEG.iQ1rMoOr2WpV&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Trump administration believed it had a plan to save TikTok last Wednesday, but the Chinese government would not let the deal proceed due to new tariffs on Chinese imports. President Trump extended the deadline for a TikTok deal into mid-June in response. ByteDance was reportedly comfortable with the new suggested plan, but even before the tariff announcement, there was no guarantee that China would approve of any deal. The talks about TikTok are likely to become even more complicated as the trade war between the two countries escalates.

Late last month, Elon Musk announced that he was merging X with xAI in a deal that valued the newly combined company at more than $100 billion. This article reveals the string of events that helped Musk announce the deal before Trump's tariffs effectively closed the market for deals. The deal moves Musk closer to his longtime goal of turning X into an 'everything app'. The combined company will initially focus on more tightly embedding xAI's Grok chatbot into X, making it more central to the app experience.

[### Ask HN: Do you still use search engines? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619768&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

More and more people are using large language models instead of search engines, but many developers are finding that the technology is not well suited to finding factual information. Search engines are still better at finding specific links and real information. Large language models can be helpful for many things, like helping someone unfamiliar with a topic better refine their searches by getting the terminology correct and exploring research topics. Search engines are still required for many things as large language models get lots of very important things wrong.

[### How Apple stockpiled iPhones to avoid tariffs and keep prices low for a while (2 minute read)](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/04/07/how-apple-stockpiled-iphones-to-avoid-tariffs-and-keep-prices-low-for-a-while?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple shipped five flights worth of Apple products in three days to the US in the last week of March to stock its warehouses. This is usually a time of the year when the company starts winding down its current-year products and starts manufacturing its September releases. The reserves that arrived at a lower duty will temporarily insulate the company from the higher prices it will need to pay under the revised tax rates. Apple is expected to take a $33 billion hit due to the Trump Administration's newly instated tariff plan.
