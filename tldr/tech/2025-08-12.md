GitHub's CEO, Thomas Dohmke, is leaving GitHub and Microsoft to become a founder. GitHub and its leadership team will now become part of Microsoft's CoreAI organization. Dohmke will be staying through until the end of the year to help guide the transition. It is unclear whether the departure and the elimination of the CEO position will change how GitHub operates or the products it creates and maintains.

Apple's new App Intents allows users to tell Siri to complete tasks with only their voice. Siri will essentially be able to operate apps with precision within their own interfaces. Testing and perfecting this feature has become a top priority for Apple's global data operations team. Apple plans to ship the feature alongside a broader Siri infrastructure overhaul in the Spring.

[### Scientists Are Finally Making Progress Against Alzheimer's (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/scientists-are-finally-making-progress-against-alzheimers-disease-patient-medicine-5a637f9b?st=pJNn3b&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

New Alzheimer's research suggests that medicines and lifestyle changes can slow, prevent, and even reverse the debilitating disease. This article discusses several of the most cutting-edge and promising treatments for Alzheimer's. The Health and Human Services Department recently announced that Dr. Vinay Prasad was returning to the FDA as head of biologics and gene therapies. Dr. Prasad has shown hostility towards Alzheimer's treatments and has said before that paying people to help patients with chores would do more good than funding these treatments.

Boom Supersonic's XB-1, the world's first independently developed supersonic jet, was created with about a tenth of the capital of any other supersonic program. It was designed, built, and flown successfully by a team of just 50 people. Foundational elements like assembling a small, exceptional team were key to the startup's success, but there were also some non-obvious lessons learned. This article is the first in a series on lessons learned at Boom on how to develop hardware quickly and efficiently. It focuses on how Boom uses software to accelerate hardware development.

React is boring tech at this point. It has one of the largest ecosystems of developers, packages, and educational content for building on the web. The composition model of React was the right architecture choice, and it continues to have benefits. However, the React of today doesn't feel like the React of 2015-2020. This article looks at what has changed and makes suggestions on how to grow the community today.

[### The Engineering Marvel That China Hopes Will Help Wean It Off Foreign Energy (7 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/the-engineering-marvel-that-china-hopes-will-help-wean-it-off-foreign-energy-f8f91e92?st=4grgSF&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China has started building a giant hydropower project at the edge of the Tibetan plateau. The $167 billion facility could generate triple the output of the world's largest hydroelectric facility, China's Three Gorges Dam, which can power 40 million Chinese homes. China is determined to become self-reliant in areas of national importance. It imported nearly a quarter of its energy supply in 2023, a level of dependency that it is working hard to undo. The project has stirred accusations that it will give China power to strangle resources beyond its borders and raised fears of environmental damage.

[### It's not 10x. It's 36x - this is what it looks like to kill a $30k meeting with AI (8 minute read)](https://cameronwestland.com/it-s-not-10x-it-s-36x-this-is-what-it-looks-like-to-kill-a-usd30k-meeting-with-ai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Improvements in AI come from embracing constraints. Context engineering is about understanding the shape of a problem and working with constraints rather than against them. The constraint is the feature, not the enemy. You can become significantly more efficient not by making AI smarter, but by understanding why your current approach fights human nature, and stopping that fight.
