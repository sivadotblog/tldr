It is for-profit and was created to address the potential risks of AI's capabilities such as generating malware, identifying open-source code exploits, and creating phishing websites. Mozilla obtained a seed investment of $30 million from the Mozilla Foundation for this new venture. While it is bound to ethical principles, Mozilla.ai is open to creating new products and companies as well as open-source projects.

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is set to appear in front of the US Congress in his first congressional hearing to address concerns over the security of TikTok. Some US lawmakers believe TikTok is a Chinese spying and propaganda machine. Chew has been working to allay suspicions and convince lawmakers that ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is unconnected to the Chinese government.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Animals without a brain still form associative memories (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/animals-without-a-brain-still-form-associative-memories/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Animals in the phylum Cnidaria lack a recognizable brain, although their nerve net performs some similar functions. A study conducted by European researchers found that cnidarians can learn to respond to stimuli, despite their lack of specialized brain structures. While the cnidarians responded to stimuli, it was not in the same way where animals learn to respond to unrelated cues. The cnidarians interpreted multiple stimuli as a single trigger. The study suggests that there is some form of central coordination within cnidarians' nerve nets.

[### A hormone shot helped drunk mice sober up quickly (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hormone-shot-drunk-mice-sober-quickly?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new study has shown that injecting drunk mice with FGF21, a naturally occurring hormone, can help them sober up twice as fast as those that didn't receive the hormone. FGF21 is produced by the liver. It activates nerve cells in the brain, enabling mice to wake up from drunkenness more quickly. Doctors currently have to wait for patients with alcohol poisoning to wake up before addressing their symptoms. A drug that could help people wake up from alcohol poisoning, similar to how Narcan helps with opioid overdoses, would be a significant improvement for treating people rushed to the emergency room.
