Quantum dot electroluminescent (QDEL) screens produce wide color spaces and are bright, affordable, and resistant to burn-in. Also known as NanoLED, the technology is being eyed as one of the most potentially influential developments for consumer displays over the next two years. There aren't any QDEL products yet and they may not be released for a while yet. This article explains how the technology works, looks at its advantages, and explores competing technologies.

[### Generative A.I. Arrives in the Gene Editing World of CRISPR (8 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/technology/generative-ai-gene-editing-crispr.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk0.JQS0.P95fZ2M-SfYp&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Profluent, a Berkeley startup, has used generative AI technology to create new gene editors based on CRISPR. The company has used one of the AI-generated gene editors to edit human DNA, but it has yet to put any of them through clinical trials. While Profluent plans to open source the gene editors generated by its AI technology, it will not be open sourcing the AI technology itself. The project is part of a wider effort to build AI technologies that improve medical care.

[### Good Ideas in Computer Science (3 minute read)](https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/good-ideas-in-cs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Programmers love to argue for their favorite technologies, but there are some ideas that are universally agreed on. This article provides a list of ideas within computer science that are universally considered good and the year each idea appeared. These ideas are so widespread and effective that many may not even think of them as being invented. The list focuses on ideas, not implementations, so some things like Unix aren't on the list. Some example items from the list include binary numbers, boolean algebra, arrays, and version control.

[### Sam Altman Invests in Energy Startup Focused on AI Data Centers (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-investment-exowatt-energy-startup-ai-data-centers-eeeca766?st=fpg7rt9j7rsq7le&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sam Altman and other investors, including venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, have put $20 million into Exowatt, a company that aims to provide big data centers with clean energy. The AI industry uses a lot of energy - a single new data center can use as much electricity as hundreds and thousands of homes. Exowatt has developed modules roughly the size of shipping containers that hold solar lenses that convert energy from the sun into heat. The company hopes to eventually offer electricity as cheap as 1 cent per kilowatt-hour without subsidies.
