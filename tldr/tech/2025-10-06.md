What's inside: LLM workflows often involve multiple calls to managed LLM platforms, making it difficult to identify the root causes of errors or latency issues during troubleshooting. Assessing the functional performance of LLM apps can be equally complex.

Written by the observability experts at Datadog, this guide shows how LLM Observability addresses these challenges with end-to-end tracing for LLM workflows.

[### OpenAI's invite-only video generation app Sora tops Apple's App Store (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/openai-sora-apple-app-store.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's new video generation app, Sora, has snagged the No. 1 spot on Apple's App Store. The app allows users to generate short-form AI videos, remix videos created by other users, and post them to a shared feed. It is only available on iOS and is invite-based. The app gives users explicit control over how their likeness is used on the platform, but some videos have sparked debate about its utility, potential for harm, and legality.

[### Apple Puts Hardware Chief John Ternus in the Succession Spotlight (14 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-05/who-will-be-apple-s-next-ceo-after-tim-cook-apple-shelves-vision-air-m5-ipad?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1OTcyNzM5MywiZXhwIjoxNzYwMzMyMTkzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUM05RT0NHUEw0MlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBOEExRDhFQTI5OTc0OTRGQTQ1QUE2REJBMjAwNTM3MSJ9.2TDImIq1eYwB-BaBNw8ke-IGf1uzQkRT04t9aUicZys&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Several of Apple's executives are expected to relinquish their responsibilities in the near future - some of them were once seen as Tim Cook's heir, making the future of the company uncertain. The company needs to urgently beef up its AI business, which could mean a shake-up or even an acquisition. Big changes are likely, especially as some executives don't have obvious successors. Cook will likely remain involved with Apple in some capacity when he eventually steps down as CEO, perhaps as a board chairman. John Ternus remains the leading contender as Cook's successor.

Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among American men. Diagnostics and therapies for the disease generated about $12 billion to $15 billion worldwide last year. Smarter screening of prostate cancers can save lives without the harms of overtreatment. New techniques and treatments cut recovery time down to weeks, with fewer of the side effects that often follow surgery or radiation.

Rocket Lab aims to fly its Neutron rocket, which is reusable, by the end of the year. Landing the rocket's booster will be a challenge - only SpaceX has achieved this feat. Rocket Lab's founder, Peter Beck, has a fixation on detail and form that has guided his course as an entrepreneur. The company's newly constructed launchpad is an example of this - it needed to be able to withstand 1.5 million pounds of thrust, but Beck added another requirement: it also had to look beautiful.
