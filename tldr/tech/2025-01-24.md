[### OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously (8 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/23/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-performs-tasks-autonomously/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has launched a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can control a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator is coming first to US users on ChatGPT Pro but will roll out to users on its Plus, Team, and Enterprise tiers eventually. OpenAI plans to integrate Operator into all of its ChatGPT clients. Operator is powered by a Computer-Using Agent that combines the vision capabilities of GPT-4o with reasoning abilities from the company's more advanced models. While Operator can perform many tasks, it currently cannot handle complex or specialized tasks or interact with highly customized or non-standard web interfaces.

[### TikTok ban could be resolved without selling to a US company, says American board member (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/23/tiktok-ban-could-be-resolved-without-selling-to-a-us-company-says-american-board-member/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

One of ByteDance's directors has suggested that a compromise deal to the TikTok ban may be possible. There are a number of alternative solutions that the company is discussing with the Trump administration that fall short of selling the company. It isn't clear what form that compromise might take, but it may allow the company to continue to operate, albeit with a change of control of some kind. ByteDance is optimistic about the dialogue that is emerging between President Trump and President Xi.

[### FDA-Approved Nasal Spray For Depression Is First Of Its Kind (4 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-approved-nasal-spray-for-depression-is-first-of-its-kind?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The FDA has approved a ketamine-based nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression in the US. The Johnson & Johnson drug, Spravato, can now be prescribed to adult patients with depression who have tried at least two antidepressants without adequate improvement in symptoms, as well as those with major depressive disorder who have acute thoughts of self-harm or suicide. While it's not clear yet why the drug works as an antidepressant, studies show that it can alleviate symptoms of depression as soon as 24 hours after the first spray, with 22.5% of patients achieving remission after four weeks of treatment. Spravato is the first new medication for major depression approved by the FDA in decades.

[### First-ever data center on the Moon set to launch next month (2 minute read)](https://www.techspot.com/news/106470-first-ever-data-center-moon-set-launch-next.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Lonestar Data Holdings, a Florida-based startup, is set to launch the first Moon-based data center in February. Dubbed the 'Freedom Data Center', the information hub will piggyback on an upcoming lunar lander mission by Intuitive Machines aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Storing data on the Moon offers unique benefits - it provides unmatched physical security and protection and is much more environmentally friendly. The company still needs to overcome enormous technical challenges as deploying a data center on the lunar surface is complex. Lonestar will maintain a ground-based backup at a Flexential facility in Tampa.

The Stargate Project, spearheaded by OpenAI, is an ambitious project that aims to invest $500 billion over the next four years into building out AI infrastructure for the US. While the announcement of the project is an early win for the Trump administration, looking below the surface yields a lot of questions.

[### Meta's GenAI org in panic mode (1 minute read)](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Meta-genai-org-in-panic-mode-KccnF41n?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta engineers are frantically trying to dissect DeepSeek's models and copy everything they can learn from it. Its management is worried about justifying the massive cost of the company's GenAI organization, especially when every single leader is making more than what it cost to train DeepSeek V3 - and there are dozens of such 'leaders'. DeepSeek V3, trained with a $5.5 million budget, is already ahead of Llama 4 in benchmarks. DeepSeek R1 made things even scarier for the Meta.
