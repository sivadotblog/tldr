[### Google working on ‚ÄòPixie‚Äô AI assistant for Pixel 9, discussed glasses with object recognition (2 minute read)](https://9to5google.com/2023/12/14/pixel-9-pixie-ai-assistant/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Pixie is an AI assistant from Google that could launch with the Pixel 9. Powered by Gemini, it will use data from Google products on devices to perform complex and multimodal tasks. Google has discussed creating glasses with the ability to recognize objects and advise wearers on how to use tools. The last bit of news on Google AR was how the hardware offer effort was being sidelined for a Samsung partnership.

[### Amazon‚Äôs Project Kuiper confirms its super-fast satellite communication tech works in space (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/14/amazons-project-kuiper-confirms-its-super-fast-satellite-communication-tech-works-in-space/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon's Project Kuiper has successfully validated key technology that will increase throughput and reduce latency for its satellite internet service customers. Optical Inter-Satellite Links use infrared lasers to send data between spacecraft in orbit. The technology allows Kuiper's satellites to connect with many other spacecraft simultaneously to form a mesh network in space capable of moving data 30% faster than terrestrial fiber-optic cables running along an equivalent distance.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### DeepMind AI outdoes human mathematicians on unsolved problem (3 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-04043-w?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

FunSearch is an AI system that can interact with a specially trained large language model to create short computer programs that generate solutions to math problems. The system checks to see whether these solutions are better than known ones, and if not, it provides feedback to the LLM so that it can improve in the next round. It was able to discover new solutions to an old problem. One important feature of FunSearch is that people can see the code created by the model and learn from it.

[### Moderna-Merck vaccine cuts odds of skin cancer recurrence in half, study finds (3 minute read)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/merck-moderna-vaccine-skin-cancer-melanoma/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An ongoing randomized vaccine trial involving 157 patients with high-risk stage III/IV melanoma is showing promising results. Those who received the vaccine were 49% less likely to die or have their cancer come back after three years than those who only received treatment with a cancer drug. Phase 3 trials of the vaccine have begun.

Vulnerability management in the cloud is no longer just about patches and fixes. In this latest report, the Wiz Security Research team put vulnerability management theory into practice using recently identified vulnerabilities as examples.

You‚Äôll learn:

* Which technology & vulnerability types to prioritize
* How to leverage CVSS metrics
* The essential questions to ask when triaging

[### Announcing SvelteKit 2 (2 minute read)](https://svelte.dev/blog/sveltekit-2?ref=dailydev&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SvelteKit is the official framework for building apps with Svelte. Version 2.0 adds support for Vite 5 and other small improvements. It also adds shallow routing, which allows developers to associate state with a history entry without causing navigation. Shallow routing is useful for creating modals that can be dismissed by swiping back or pop-up views of routes that don't require full navigation.

[### PyApp (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ofek/pyapp?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

PyApp is a wrapper for Python applications that bootstrap themselves at runtime. It can easily build standalone binaries for every platform with extremely configurable runtime behavior allowing for the targeting of different end users. PyApp provides optional management commands that allow for functionalities like self-updates.

[### Should you add screenshots to documentation? (6 minute read)](https://thisisimportant.net/posts/screenshots-in-documentation/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article looks at the advantages and disadvantages to adding screenshots to documentation and provides guidelines for using screenshots in documentation. Screenshots in documentation can be bad as outdated screenshots can cause customers to lose trust in the documentation accuracy, they make pages load more slowly, they make the documentation less accessible, and using them can cause writers to produce lower-quality instructions. However, they can be useful as they make it easier to find relevant parts of the content, provide a visual frame of reference for readers, and can supplement confusing task steps.

[### OpenAI Demos a Control Method for Superintelligent AI (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/openai-alignment?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI launched a superalignment program earlier this year to find a technical means to control a superintelligent AI system. It has devoted 20% of its compute to the effort and hopes to have solutions by 2027. The first preprint paper from the superalignment team tests whether a weaker AI (GPT-2) can supervise a stronger one (GPT-4). OpenAI is offering US $10 million in grants for work on a variety of alignment approaches.
