[### The death of the stubborn developer (15 minute read)](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-stubborn-developer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The circuit that lets junior developers grow into senior developers is broken, or at least damaged. Many tasks can now be automated, so companies don't need as many junior contributors. Developers who don't adopt chat-based programming as their primary modality will be left behind.

[### A letter to open-source maintainers (6 minute read)](https://xuanwo.io/2024/10-a-letter-to-open-source-maintainers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

People contributing to open source are under no obligation to stay in a project. The best thing to do is to make sure projects can continue to operate smoothly even after you leave. The license maintainers choose will influence how their project is utilized and how it develops, so maintainers should fully understand the implications of each license before making a decision. It's okay to step away from projects if they don't make you happy.
