[### SpaceX wants to launch up to 120 times a year from Florida ‚Äî and competitors aren't happy about it (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/spacex-wants-to-launch-up-to-120-times-a-year-from-florida-and-competitors-arent-happy-about-it/?guccounter=1&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Several agencies are now preparing impact statements for SpaceX's Starship launch plans. SpaceX plans to launch its Starship mega-rocket up to 44 times per year from NASA's Kennedy Space Center and up to 76 times per year from the Space Launch Complex at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Elon Musk aims to eventually launch Starship multiple times per day, with each launch delivering hundreds of tons of cargo to low Earth orbit or beyond. Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance have expressed concerns that SpaceX's high flight rate will have effects on other launch providers with infrastructure at Kennedy and Cape Canaveral.

[### Changing a Single Gene Gave Mice Supercharged Hearing (4 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/changing-a-single-gene-gave-mice-supercharged-hearing?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

University of Michigan researchers have created mice with supercharged hearing abilities by dialing up the expression of a nerve growth gene called neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3). Previous research has shown that increasing Ntf3 expression can improve hearing in middle-aged mice and help recover some hearing in mice with damaged inner ears. The treatment works by increasing the number of connections between hair cells in the ear's cochlea and the brain. The researchers believe the treatment could potentially work in humans.

This article looks into the history of the research into subterranean life and how it has changed the way scientists see life and the planet. Earth's crust is teeming with subterranean life that scientists are just starting to begin to understand. These microbes may closely resemble some of the earliest single-celled organisms that ever existed. They make up an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the biomass on Earth.

[### Why are Japanese developers not undergoing mass layoffs? (14 minute read)](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-are-japanese-developers-not-undergoing-mass-layoffs?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Japan seems immune to many of the layoffs and trends seen abroad. Employee protections play a major factor in ensuring this stability for employees. Layoffs are incredibly difficult to implement under Japanese employment law. Companies need to be under severe financial difficulty and at risk of insolvency and they have to have exhausted all other cost-saving measures. There are also cultural factors - reducing their workforce can reflect poorly on a company's reputation with the public and prospective future employees.
