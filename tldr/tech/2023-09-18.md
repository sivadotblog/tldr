[### In the Google antitrust trial, defaults are everything and nobody likes Bing (13 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/15/23875342/justice-department-google-antitrust-search-trial-week-one-recap?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US Justice Department says that Google owes its dominance thanks to a series of coercive deals that have let the search engine market stagnate. Google's anti-competitive tactics allowed it to maintain an overwhelming search engine monopoly. The company struck many deals that would make its search engine the default and then used its vast quantities of search data to improve its engine, creating a feedback loop that made it almost impossible to beat. One of the most important questions in the case is whether consumer harm can apply to free products like search engines.

Researchers from the University of Chicago‚Äôs Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering have developed a new type of vaccine that can completely reverse autoimmune diseases without shutting down the rest of the immune system. The vaccine removes the immune system's memory of one molecule, stopping autoimmune reactions like those seen in multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, or rheumatoid arthritis. Initial phase I safety trials of the vaccine are currently underway.

The US military has been pushing satellite and launch companies to become more responsive in their ability to put spacecraft into space so that assets can be rapidly replaced in orbit if they are destroyed during a conflict. It contracted with US launch company Firefly to build a spacecraft that can be put into orbit within 24 hours of receiving the go command from the military. The system was recently tested, with Firefly successfully launching a satellite within 27 hours of receiving the go command.

[### What Silicon Valley "Gets" about Software Engineers that Traditional Companies Do Not (17 minute read)](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Silicon Valley companies consistently get a few things that traditional companies either fail to understand or implement in practice. These practices result in faster innovation, better professional growth, better utilization, and higher wages. They include giving software engineers autonomy, treating engineers as curious problem solvers rather than mindless resources, exposing engineers to the business and business metrics, investing in a less frustrating developer experience, and considering engineers as value generators. People who have worked in Silicon Valley-like environments tend to struggle to go back to the traditional workplace.
