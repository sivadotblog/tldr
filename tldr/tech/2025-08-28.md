[### Google has eliminated 35% of managers overseeing small teams in past year, exec says (6 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google has eliminated more than a third of its managers overseeing small teams in the last year. Many of those managers have stayed with Google as individual contributors. Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023 and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. The company has offered buyouts to employees since January and has slowed hiring.

[### TikTok owner ByteDance eyes valuation of over $330 billion as revenue surpasses Meta (5 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/tiktok-owner-bytedance-sets-valuation-over-330-billion-revenue-grows-sources-say-2025-08-27/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

ByteDance is set to launch a new employee share buyback that will value it at more than $330 billion. It plans to offer current employees $200.41 per share in the repurchase program. The buyback is expected to be launched in the autumn. It's becoming increasingly common for late-stage private companies to conduct regular buybacks to retain and provide liquidity to employees without an exit, such as an initial public offering.

Many science communicators moved to Bluesky after Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X. The online scientific community on Bluesky has now hit a critical mass. Many are finding it to be a better environment for discussing their interests. Bluesky is user-friendly with no algorithm. It provides helpful tools for beginners, and users have the ability to block or mute people.

Researchers from the University of Queensland have successfully grown fully functional human skin in a laboratory. They used stem cells to create a replica of human skin with blood vessels, capillaries, hair follicles, multiple layers of tissue, and immune cells. The skin model took six years to develop. It will be transformative for skin graft transplants, wound healing, and the study of skin disorders.

[### I Managed a Swarm of 20 AI Agents for a Week and Built a Product. Here Are the 8 Rules I Learned (9 minute read)](https://zachwills.net/i-managed-a-swarm-of-20-ai-agents-for-a-week-here-are-the-8-rules-i-learned/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI isn't just about writing code faster, it's about changing the nature of work. Engineers' value is shifting from the act of implementation to the art of direction. Their worth will be measured by how many agents they can effectively manage and how well they can architect an intelligent, self-improving system. Senior engineers and systems thinkers are about to become even more valuable because they have the architectural vision to direct these agentic systems.

[### The unexpected productivity boost of Rust (9 minute read)](https://lubeno.dev/blog/rusts-productivity-curve?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

At some point, codebases get too big for developers to keep all of the parts in their heads at the same time. Projects typically hit a significant slowdown at this stage. However, Rust's strong safety guarantees make it easier for developers to refactor even critical parts of apps, giving them more confidence and increasing their productivity. This allows developers to worry less and try out more things without worrying about breaking the existing stuff.

[### The Rise of Front-Loaded Vesting (10 minute read)](https://www.levels.fyi/blog/front-loaded-vesting.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Front‚Äëloaded vesting - higher Year‚Äë1 value, a smaller initial grant, and refreshers as the engine of long‚Äëterm pay - is becoming the default. It tightens the link to performance, shifting rewards from tenure to contribution. Employees should evaluate offers on the first two years and steady‚Äëstate and insist on transparent refresher rules before signing. With this model, value arrives earlier, so document impact, broaden cross-functional reach, and align to promotion rubrics, as mobility and visibility matter.

[### Google Could Get Broken Up This Week. Here's What It Would Mean (4 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/opinion/google-antitrust-remedy-ai.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hk8.zRCs.e5pvHvTOoE17&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A court is widely expected to decide on Google's fate this week after a decision last year that held that the company broke antitrust laws by using illegal means to maintain a monopoly over online search. The court has several options, including breaking up Google by ordering it to sell Chrome or Android, or making it share valuable data with its rivals. Whatever it decides, the measure of success is whether people who work at big companies start quitting their jobs to start new companies. Previous antitrust cases against large tech companies have helped spawn industries.
