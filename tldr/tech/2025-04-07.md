China has withheld approval for a deal that involved the launch of a new US-based version of TikTok owned and operated by a majority of American investors. White House officials had planned for President Trump to sign an executive order approving the proposal, which had the blessings of investors and ByteDance. Trump's recent tariffs have angered China and prompted retaliatory measures against the US. The deadline to reach a deal has been extended by another 75 days.

[### The first people to fly in space over the poles got this stunning view (3 minute read)](https://mashable.com/article/spacex-fram2-polar-orbit-images?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chun Wang, Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, and Eric Philips were the first people to fly over Earth's poles in space. The private mission launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on a Falcon 9 rocket on March 31. While these were the first people to make the journey, low-Earth polar orbits are commonly used for weather-tracking and spy satellites. Photos and video from the mission are available in the article.

[### This Brain-Computer Interface Is Now a Two-Way Street (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/brain-computer-interface-2671662991?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research have developed a technology that allows brain-computer interfaces to provide touch feedback to users. The technology was implanted into a patient who was paralyzed from the chest down after a driving accident. It allowed the patient not only to control movements in his hand but also to receive touch feedback and 'feel', using those sensations to guide movements. The patient was able to pick up a cup and drink from it just by thinking about performing the task and pick up an empty eggshell without cracking it.

[### The curve is bending (17 minute read)](https://grantslatton.com/the-curve-is-bending?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Model output is now actually worth more than the cost of real dev work. It's starting to make sense to throw a lot of money towards inference. This will probably cause some disruption in the junior dev job market - or at least disrupt what it means to be a junior dev. Code-writing agents are predicted to essentially match college graduates in almost all software tasks by the end of 2026.

The model will incorporate voice, Canvas, search, deep research, and more.
