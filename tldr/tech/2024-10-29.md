[### We've Found the Source of Most Meteorites (4 minute read)](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/weve-found-the-source-of-most-meteorites/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

70% of meteorites come from three collisions that occurred in the asteroid belt within the past 40 million years. An exhaustive study by an international team of scientists has tracked down the sources of most meteorites falling on Earth. The team gathered data and ran simulations to reveal how collisions produce families of asteroids that start in similar orbits and how those fragments spread out over time. Their work still needs to be validated, but it explains several key observables with a single model.

[### We're forking Flutter. This is why (11 minute read)](https://flutterfoundation.dev/blog/posts/we-are-forking-flutter-this-is-why/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Flutter began as a UI toolkit for mobile only before expanding to the web and desktop platforms. Despite the project's massive expansion of scope and responsibility, the Flutter team has only marginally increased its size. Flutter has been forked to help expand its available labor and accelerate development. The Flock fork will remain constantly up to date with Flutter but add important bug fixes and popular community features. The Flutter team can choose to add these bug fixes and features on their own schedule.

[### Open-source AI must reveal its training data, per new OSI definition (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24281820/open-source-initiative-definition-artificial-intelligence-meta-llama?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Open Source Initiative (OSI) has released its official definition of 'open' artificial intelligence. For an AI system to be considered truly open source, it must provide the complete code used to build and run the AI, access to details about the data used to train the AI so others can understand and recreate it, and the settings and weights from the training. The definition directly challenges Meta's Llama, which has restrictions on commercial use and does not provide access to training data. Meta claims that it restricts access to its training data due to safety concerns, but critics say the company is just minimizing its legal liability and safeguarding its competitive advantage.

This article contains a transcript of an interview with Airbnb cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky, who made a lot of waves earlier this year when he started talking about something called 'founder mode'.
