Apple is reportedly developing an AI personality entirely separate from Siri for future Apple robotics devices. The company's first robotics projects are not expected to debut until 2026 or 2027. Apple will ship a brand new Apple Intelligence-fused Siri in iOS 18.1 later this fall. However, many of Siri's most powerful new capabilities aren't scheduled to arrive until sometime in 2025.

[### For His Second Trip to Space, Billionaire Has Grander, Riskier Aspirations (14 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/science/spacex-polaris-dawn-mission-spacewalk.html?unlocked_article_code=1.F04.44Up.44aRrMdBjjXG&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman is scheduled to head into space for the second time later this week. The itinerary for the trip includes the first ever spacewalk by private astronauts. The mission will travel farther than anyone has traveled since the Apollo 17 mission went to the Moon in 1972. It will pass through regions of intense radiation while testing new technologies and gathering data on the effects space has on the human body.

[### How Do You 3D Print Glass? (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/glass-3d-printing?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana are working to adapt artisan glass-blowing techniques to a robotic platform. They have developed a technique that uses a laser to heat the surface of a glass rod so it can be deformed to create 3D shapes. It is able to create the transparent solid structures needed in optical, microfluidic, and photonic devices. The method can deposit glass at 15 cubic millimeters per second. A picture of the glass 3D printer is available.

[### Why should anyone boot \*you\* up? (5 minute read)](https://solmaz.io/why-should-anyone-boot-you-up?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google researchers recently published a paper detailing a scanning process that can yield a geometric model of the brain's wiring at nanometer resolution. Further development of the method could result in technology that can scan a person's brain and recreate them far into the future. However, the amount of data needed to store all of the information from just one human brain is infeasible with current technology. The biggest problem in digital immortality might not be technical, but economical.

[### 'Pressure Cooker': Why Millionaire Nvidia Employees Are Still Working Until 2 a.m. (3 minute read)](https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/millionaire-nvidia-employees-still-working-until-2-am/478989?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many of Nvidia's employees are millionaires because of the company's growth. Despite this, the company still has a 'pressure cooker' culture with long working hours, yelling and fighting at meetings, and company politics. Some employees work every day, including weekends, late into the night. Employees who work less than the norm are called out at company-wide meetings. The company maintains a low turnover rate, likely due to the way it gives its employees access to stock grants and its 'flat' hierarchy, which could make the company an appealing choice.
