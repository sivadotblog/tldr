Manual testing on personal devices is too slow and too limited. It forces teams to cut releases a week early just to test before submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage, issues slip through.

[### Android's full desktop interface leaks (2 minute read)](https://9to5google.com/2026/01/27/android-desktop-leak/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A bug report on the Chromium Issue Tracker has inadvertently leaked the Android desktop interface. The bug report, which was about Chrome Incognito tabs, was accompanied by two screen captures. They show a taller status bar compared to tablets, a Chrome interface that mostly aligns with the current large-screen Android version, and mostly unchanged desktop windowing. The screen captures are available in the article.

[### Tesla to Invest $2 Billion in Elon Musk's xAI, Cancel Two EV Models (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/tesla-tsla-q4-earnings-report-2025-191b2aab?st=VbVhhU&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla entered into an agreement on January 16 to invest in xAI's Series E funding round. SpaceX also invested $2 billion in xAI. Tesla will end production for its Model S and Model X higher-end vehicles, as they have seen sluggish sales compared with other models. The Model X and S factory space will be used to manufacture Optimus robots.

[### Video: China's 18 humanoid robots emerge from crates in an Ex Machina-like scene (5 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/ai-robotics/limx-humanoid-robots-walk-out-of-crates?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

LimX Dynamics has released a video showing 18 of its full-sized humanoid robots autonomously performing a coordinated routine. The showcase highlights how teams of robots could be deployed and operate on future manufacturing floors. LimX's robots run on the company's newly introduced COSA system, which allows multiple humanoid robots to function together autonomously. The COSA operating system unifies perception models, learned skills, memory, and basic emotional states for sustained physical interaction in real-world settings. The video is available in the article.

[### Researchers Are Using AI to Decode the Human Genome (7 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/science/alphagenome-ai-deepmind-genetics.html?unlocked_article_code=1.IFA.0kSR.yuP-LgmiaVrb&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AlphaGenome is an AI model that can make predictions about thousands of genes. It was trained on a vast wealth of molecular data, allowing it to predict things like whether a mutation will shut off a gene or switch it on at the wrong time. The model is being deployed for use in things like cancer research, but scientists are still wary of its results. AlphaGenome is still just a prediction tool, so scientists still need to go to the lab to verify its output.

[### The 80% Problem in Agentic Coding (20 minute read)](https://addyo.substack.com/p/the-80-problem-in-agentic-coding?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI writing most of the code places a disproportionate emphasis on the human's role of owning outcomes, maintaining quality bars, and ensuring that tests actually validate behavior. The danger is that the AI succeeds so well that developers stop checking their outputs. AI is an amplifier of development practices. Bad processes will result in accumulated debt at an unprecedented speed.

The cost of code is dropping so fast that teams need to reconsider their tech debt payment plans. Smart teams are deferring payment on human hours today to pay them back with cheaper AI hours tomorrow. Cashing in on those cheap hours requires understanding how to move through the tiers of automation. Luckily, the federal government has already completed a roadmap for autonomous cars. The five levels of driving automation are a helpful guide on what companies should aim for.

[### Amazon laying off about 16,000 corporate workers in latest anti-bureaucracy push (4 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/amazon-layoffs-anti-bureaucracy-ai.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon announced yesterday that it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate jobs in its second round of job cuts since last October. The layoffs are part of an ongoing effort to strengthen the organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy. 14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce during October's layoffs. Amazon has been cutting costs across its businesses so that it can invest more in AI and the rapid build-out of data centers. It recently closed its Fresh and Go grocery chains after years of experimentation.

[### AI assisted interviews (2 minute read)](https://www.spakhm.com/ai-interviews?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

When faced with a problem, strong candidates stay calm, form precise hypotheses, and then systematically test one hypothesis at a time until they zero in on a solution. AI just accelerates this process. Weak candidates blindly try things, hoping something sticks. Their process remains sloppy when using AI. AI doesn't by default make people perform better, it amplifies people's existing patterns.
