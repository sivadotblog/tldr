[### Twitter is now marking Substack links as unsafe (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/7/23674936/twitter-marking-substack-links-unsafe?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Substack links are being marked as unsafe on Twitter. Twitter now shows a notice warning users that the site is potentially spammy or unsafe. Users are also unable to embed tweets into their stories or like or retweet posts containing Substack links. It appears the move against Substack may be due to the recent launch of its Twitter-like 'Notes' feature.

[### Stability AI is on shaky ground as it burns through cash and looks at a management overhaul (6 minute read)](https://www.semafor.com/article/04/07/2023/stability-ai-is-on-shaky-ground-as-it-burns-through-cash?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Stability AI, unlike its competitors, has no deep-pocketed partners. The company has burned through a significant chunk of the money it has raised, and investors are now unsure whether to participate in its next funding round, which would quadruple the firm's valuation to $4 billion. Some employees have lost faith in Stability AI's CEO, but there are plans to bring in strong executive talent. The company's future depends on whether it can develop cutting-edge AI models on its own and whether it can ramp up sales to large companies.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Land it like SpaceX: China claims breakthrough in rocket vertical landing (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/china-claims-breakthrough-rocket-vertical-landing?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China's CAS Space has successfully tested a rocket's vertical landing in the ocean. Its rocket prototype flew more than 1,000 meters and then dropped smoothly using reverse thrust, landing with a precision of less than 10 meters. The test could lead to the reuse of rocket stages similar to SpaceX's technology. Future Chinese rocket models will make use of the technology, which could result in significant cost savings for launches.

[### This startup wants to create a penicillin for viruses (8 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/health/broad-spectrum-antiviral?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

New Zealand-based startup Kimer Med is attempting to develop a broad-spectrum antiviral that uses a target in human cells to attack a wide variety of viruses. Its approach involves identifying double-stranded RNA, a signal that most viral infections create, and then triggering a process that will kill the infected cell. The mechanism has already shown some promise in lab studies. There are still many challenges to overcome, but if the company is successful, the technology could bring a change as significant as broad-spectrum antibiotics were for the world.
