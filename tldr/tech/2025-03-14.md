[### Apple is reportedly bringing live translation to AirPods (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/news/629506/apple-airpods-live-translation-ios-19?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is planning to bring live translation to AirPods in iOS 19. The feature will allow users to hear a translated version of speech through their AirPods - their iPhones will play a translation from its speakers if the user responds. In addition to the feature, Apple plans to overhaul the design of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS this year. It will delay the release of its AI-upgraded Siri as it is taking longer than expected to deliver.

[### Nvidia's next chips are named after Vera Rubin, astronomer who discovered dark matter (9 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/nvidia-to-detail-vera-rubin-chips-at-gtc-conference.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Most of Nvidia's most recent GPU architectures have been named after famous women scientists. Its next critical AI chip platform will be named after Vera Rubin, an American astronomer. Rubin discovered a lot of what is known about dark matter. Nvidia has been naming its architectures after scientists since 1998. It has never explained its naming convention and hasn't emphasized the diversity aspect of its choices, but its names are one of the most visible efforts in the tech industry to honor diversity.

Bryan Johnson, the investor and founder behind the Don't Die movement, wants to start testing as much food as possible to hold brands accountable for unsafe food practices. One of the measures Johnson takes to extend his life is to eat healthy, but he says that eating healthy is not as easy as you'd think as it is hard to buy clean food. Most foods could contain toxins from various processing methods. Johnson plans to create a public database where people can donate money to have certain foods and brands tested for toxins.

[### Dwarf Lemurs Combat Aging During Hibernation by Reversing Their Cellular Clocks (3 minute read)](https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/dwarf-lemurs-combat-aging-during-hibernation-by-reversing-their-cellular?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The fat-tailed dwarf lemur, a hamster-sized primate from Madagascar, is the closest genetic relative to humans known to hibernate. They tend to live longer than expected given their size. New research shows that these small primates can reverse cellular aging. Telomeres in hibernating lemurs grow longer - the lengthening may serve as a protective mechanism against cell damage. Other mammals, including humans, have also exhibited telomere lengthening in response to extreme metabolic states. Understanding the mechanisms behind this phenomenon could pave the way for the development of novel treatments to slow or prevent age-related diseases.

[### Beware tech career advice from old heads (2 minute read)](https://jacobian.org/2025/mar/13/beware-advice-from-old-heads/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

People new to tech should take career advice from people who have been in the industry for more than a decade with enormous skepticism. The options available to people with established careers are dramatically different from what newcomers experience. These differences are so huge that newcomers and experienced workers might as well be in totally different industries. The tech industry of 15 or 20 years ago was very different from today.

[### HTTP/3 is everywhere but nowhere (25 minute read)](https://httptoolkit.com/blog/http3-quic-open-source-support-nowhere/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

HTTP/3 has been in development since at least 2016. While almost a third of web traffic has been migrated to it already, neither HTTP/3 nor QUIC (the protocol beneath it) are included in the standard libraries of any major languages. There are a rare few external libraries for some languages, but all are experimental and/or independent of other core networking APIs. Rollout of HTTP/3 has barely started rolling out to any popular open source tools. Underlying organizational differences are causing a split in technologies on the Internet. The technology is great, but it's a challenge if those benefits are not evenly distributed and only accessible to a small set of organizations and their customers.
