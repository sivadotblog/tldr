[### Physicists Create Biggest-Ever Schr√∂dinger's Cat (3 minute read)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/physicists-create-biggest-ever-schroedingers-cat/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich have created a sapphire crystal that exists in a quantum-mechanical superposition of two vibrational states. The 16-microgram crystal is the largest object ever to exist in the state of quantum superposition. Larger objects do not follow quantum mechanics, even though they are composed of particles that obey the rules of quantum mechanics. Finding larger quantum superposition states is a way for scientists to stretch the limit of observed quantum-mechanical objects.
