Twitter's consumer product leader Kayvon Beykpour and general manager of revenue Bruce Falck have been asked to leave the company. Jay Sullivan will take over as both the head of product and interim head of revenue. Twitter had goals to deliver big growth in audience and revenue but it did not hit its milestones. The company is also pausing most hiring and backfills except for business-critical roles. It will pull back on non-labor costs to ensure it is being responsible and efficient.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### AI traffic light system could make traffic jams a distant memory (3 minute read)](https://techxplore.com/news/2022-05-ai-traffic-distant-memory.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have developed an AI system that reads live camera footage and adopts traffic lights to keep traffic flowing and reduce congestion. The researchers used deep reinforcement learning to create the system, rewarding it when cars go through a junction and giving it negative feedback when cars have to wait or there is a jam. It was trained through simulations and significantly outperformed all other methods when tested. The program can be set up to view any traffic junction and can learn autonomously. The researchers hope to begin testing their system on real roads this year.

[### Plants have been grown in lunar soil for the 1st time ever (6 minute read)](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/world/plants-lunar-soil-scn/index.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have grown plants in lunar soil using samples collected during the Apollo missions to the moon. The scientists grew thale cress, a small flowering plant that is attractive to researchers as it is well studied and its genetic code has been mapped. Almost all of the plants planted in the lunar soil sprouted. However, the plants showed signs of struggle and stress. Growing plants in the lunar soil could alter the moon's soil and make resources from the soil available in useful forms.

[### Feast your eyes on the first image of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way (9 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/05/feast-your-eyes-on-the-first-image-of-the-black-hole-at-the-center-of-our-milky-way/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There is a supermassive black hole more than four million times the mass of our Sun at the heart of our galaxy. Scientists have produced the first image of the black hole using the international Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The EHT is a collection of telescopes scattered around the globe that records light in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum from different locations. The images are combined and processed to create a high-resolution image picture. The image of the black hole is available in the article.
