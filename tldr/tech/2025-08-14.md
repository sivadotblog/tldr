Apple is banking on an ambitious product road map to help get its AI effort on track. It is working on a slate of new devices, including robots, a lifelike version of Siri, a smart speaker with a display, and home-security cameras. The centerpiece of the company's AI strategy is a tabletop robot that serves as a virtual companion. Home security is also seen as another big opportunity.

### Programming, Design & Data Science

[### sshrc (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/cdown/sshrc?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

sshrc works just like ssh, but it also sources the ~/.sshrc on your local computer after logging in remotely. It can be used to set environment variables, define functions, and run post-login commands. sshrc can be very useful for developers who share servers with multiple users and can't edit the server's ~/.bashrc without affecting them, or if they have several servers that they don't want to configure independently.

[### pyx (3 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1955695947716985241.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

pyx is an optimized backend for uv that makes uv even faster, more secure, and hardware-aware. It can be used to host private packages or as a frontend to public sources like PyPI. pyx solves many of the problems in uv that can't be solved with a client alone, but could be solved with a server. It is not yet generally available, but the development team is currently looking for more early users.

[### I'm Worried It Might Get Really Bad (12 minute read)](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/im-worried-it-might-get-bad?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There are indicators that the US, and perhaps the rest of the world, may experience a spontaneous recession type of thing in the next few months or years. Really talented people are losing their jobs, business leaders are explicitly saying they're looking to replace human workers with AI, most workers aren't putting much effort in, and the effects of tariffs haven't even fully hit yet. There are many things happening right now, or that could happen soon, that could combine to create a narrative of panic in a population that's just barely holding on.
