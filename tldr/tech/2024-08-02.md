Intel is downsizing its workforce by over 15 percent as part of a new cost savings plan for 2025. The $10 billion cost saving plan will mean a headcount reduction of greater than 15,000 roles. Intel plans to reduce its R&D and marketing spending by billions each year through 2026, reduce capital expenditures by more than 20 percent this year, restructure to stop non-essential work, and review all active projects and equipment to make sure it's not spending too much. The company recently reported a loss of $1.6 billion for Q2, which is substantially more than the $437 million it lost the previous quarter.

[### A protein called Reelin keeps popping up in brains that resist aging and Alzheimer's (7 minute read)](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/07/29/g-s1-13519/alzheimers-protein-reelin-brain-aging-amyloid-tau-memory?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A key protein called Reelin appears to protect the brain from Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging. Studies suggest that the protein helps maintain thinking and memory in ailing brains. The research has inspired efforts to develop a drug that boosts Reelin or helps it function better. The discovery of Reelin was aided by the cooperation of about 1,500 members of an extended Colombian family that carries a gene that almost guarantees the development of Alzheimer's in middle age.

[### Fully-automatic robot dentist performs world's first human procedure (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/robot-dentist-world-first/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An AI-controlled autonomous robot has performed an entire dental procedure on a human patient for the first time. The system uses a hand-held 3D volumetric scanner that builds a detailed 3D model of the mouth using optical coherence tomography, cutting X-ray radiation out of the process. The robot surgeon plans out the operation after the human dentist and patient agree on what needs to be done. It can prepare a tooth for a dental crown in 15 minutes, a procedure that usually takes two hours split into two visits. Video of the robot is available in the article.

[### Why CSV is still king (5 minute read)](https://konbert.com/blog/why-csv-is-still-king?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

CSV is simple, resilient, and seemingly impossible to kill off. The standard developed naturally as a simple way to store data in tables when storage was very limited. It has become crucial for business data - companies use it to share financial data, import customer information, and exchange data between different systems. While it has its problems, the format will likely remain king, as its core simplicity will keep it relevant for years to come.

Meta believes it will need significantly more computing power to train models in the future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's second-quarter earnings call that he would rather risk building capacity before it is needed rather than too late given the long lead time for spinning up new inference projects. The company is considering different data center projects, which may increase capital expenditures in 2025. India is currently the largest market for Meta's AI chatbot.

[### Elon Musk's little company town is getting a school, if regulators allow it (3 minute read)](https://qz.com/elon-musk-school-texas-utopia-spacex-tesla-hyperloop-1851610736?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk plans to launch an experimental private school called Ad Astra in September ahead of the 2024 to 2025 school year. Ad Astra will be based in Bastrop, Texas, a rural community that has been transformed into somewhat of a hub for several of Musk's companies. Musk previously founded another school in 2014 after pulling five of his children from public school. His nonprofit, the Foundation, plans to eventually build a futuristic university in Texas. Ad Astra is now accepting applications for kids between the ages of 3 and 9.
