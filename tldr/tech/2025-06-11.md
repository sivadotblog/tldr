[### A frustrated Zuckerberg makes his biggest AI bet as Meta nears $14 billion stake in Scale AI, hires founder Wang (6 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/zuckerberg-makes-metas-biggest-bet-on-ai-14-billion-scale-ai-deal.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta is finalizing a deal to invest $14 billion into Scale AI, a company that helps AI startups prepare data to train cutting-edge AI models. Meta is one of Scale AI's biggest customers. The social media giant appears to be taking a similar strategy as other tech companies like Google and Microsoft which are taking large stakes in prominent leaders in AI rather than buying them outright - Meta is currently on trial for antitrust claims and it doesn't want to further upset regulators by acquiring Scale AI. It will take a 49% stake in Scale AI, and Scale AI's CEO will help lead a new AI research lab within Meta.

[### Snap to launch smaller, lighter augmented reality Specs smartglasses in 2026 (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/snap-specs-smart-glasses-ar.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Snap plans to release a sixth generation of its augmented reality glasses in 2026. The next-generation glasses will be called Specs and use AR technology to let people see and interact with digital imagery overlaid over the physical world. It will run on Snap OS. Developers will be able to incorporate Google's Gemini AI models and OpenAI's GPT family of AI models into programs they develop for the smart glasses. The most recent version of Snap's augmented reality glass was released in September 2024 to developers who had to pay $99 a month for a full year under a leasing model.

[### IBM now describing its first error-resistant quantum compute system (8 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/ibm-is-now-detailing-what-its-first-quantum-compute-system-will-look-like/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

IBM has released plans for a quantum compute system that can perform 100 million operations without errors on a collection of 200 logical qubits. The hardware, which will be called Starling, will be available for use in 2029. While the system will be able to handle some problems, it will not be enough to perform the complex algorithms needed to do things like break encryptions - that would require waiting for IBM's Blue Jay, a system with 2,000 logical qubits the company expects to build by 2033.

Google has done multiple buyout offers in a few units this year.

[### Reflections from Sam Altman (8 minute read)](https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI started almost nine years ago with the goal of building the most impactful technology in human history: artificial general intelligence (AGI). The launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, kicked off the current AI revolution. Over the past two years, the company had to build almost from scratch around this new technology, which was a difficult and messy process. Sam Altman considers these years to be the most rewarding, fun, best, interesting, exhausting, stressful, and unpleasant years of his life so far. He is confident that OpenAI now knows how to build AGI and believes that the first AI agents will join the workforce this year and materially change the output of companies.
