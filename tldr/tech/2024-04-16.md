Automation is high on the agenda for most organizations, but often fails to materialize ‚Äî especially when processes are only automated in a single software system, team, or device.

Even simple-sounding processes often follow a complex logic. That's where [process orchestration](https://page.camunda.com/wp-process-orchestration-handbook?utm_medium=paid_leadgen&utm_source=tldr&utm_content=april_16_primary) comes in: coordinating the various endpoints of a business process (people / systems / devices), or tying multiple processes together.

Elon Musk sent a memo to Tesla employees saying that the company will lay off more than 10% of its global workforce. Tesla had 140,473 employees as of December 2023. Its shares have fallen 31% year to date. Electric vehicle sales are gaining popularity worldwide, but the company is facing more competition now than ever. It is also dealing with other challenges, such as logistical problems caused by Yemeni Houthi maritime attacks in the Red Sea and production suspension at its gigafactory near Berlin due to suspected arson at a nearby electricity substation. A copy of the memo from Musk is available at the end of the article.

[### Limitless is a new AI tool for your meetings ‚Äî and an all-hearing wearable gadget (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130832/limitless-ai-pendant-wearable-meetings?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Limitless Pendant is a device that records everything its wearers hear and then uses AI to help them remember and make sense of it. Designed to be clipped onto a shirt or worn on a string around the neck, it uses a beam-forming technology that can more clearly record people around the user and not the rest of the room. The Pendant is part of a system that uses data from different apps to provide users with useful information. The company plans to eventually create AI agents that do things on users' behalf.

[### Got tinnitus? A device that tickles the tongue helps this musician find relief (9 minute read)](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/15/1244501055/tinnitus-hearing-loss-ringing-ear-noise?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Lenire is a device that treats tinnitus using electrical stimulation of the tongue. Approved by the FDA in March last year, the device consists of a plastic mouthpiece with stainless steel electrodes. A clinical trial found that 84% of participants who tried Lenire experienced a significant reduction in symptoms. While the device costs around $4,000, more than 80% of the participants in the clinical trial said they would recommend the device to a friend with tinnitus. It is unclear how long the benefits last as clinical trials have only evaluated the device over a 1-year period.

[### California is Losing Tech Jobs (14 minute read)](https://www.apricitas.io/p/california-is-losing-tech-jobs?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article takes a close look at how California's tech industry has changed over the last few years as well as how this has impacted the state itself and the rest of the tech industry in the US. Many of the tech industry's traditional hubs have suffered significantly since late 2022, with nowhere more so than California. The state has lost its share of US employment across wide swaths of the tech industry. Its share of jobs in subsectors like software publishing and computer system design has fallen to some of the lowest levels on record. The drop has been especially pronounced within Silicon Valley.
