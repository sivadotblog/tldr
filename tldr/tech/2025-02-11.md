[### Elon Musk-Led Group Makes $97.4 Billion Bid for Control of OpenAI (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-openai-bid-4af12827?st=i5fdNw&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A group of investors led by Elon Musk offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, but the offer was quickly rejected. OpenAI's structure ensures that no individual can take control of the company. Sam Altman and Musk co-founded OpenAI as a charity in 2015. Musk left the company in 2019 and has since filed a series of legal complaints against OpenAI accusing the company of betraying its original nonprofit mission by creating a for-profit arm and colluding with Microsoft to dominate the development of AI.

[### T-Mobile's Starlink messaging service is now free to try, even if you aren't on T-Mobile (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/news/609208/t-mobile-starlink-satellite-free-beta-price-launch?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

T-Mobile's Starlink-powered direct-to-cell satellite messaging service is now open for anyone in the US to try for free. Verizon and AT&T customers can also try the service for free. T-Mobile customers will pay $15 per month after the free testing period ($10 for customers who participated in the beta trial) while other customers will pay $20 a month per line. The service will be included in T-Mobile's Go5G Next plan.

[### Gyroscope-on-a-Chip Targets GPS' Dominance (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-gyroscopes-on-chip?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anello Photonics and OSCP showcased their gyroscope-based navigation systems at CES earlier this year. Anello's devices, which can fit in the palm of a person's hand, deliver high precision for multiple applications. OSCP's multi-gyroscope inertial measurement units provide location accuracy to within centimeters. These systems are designed to work alongside GPS as a fallback in case GPS interference is detected.

[### Chinese scientists created mice with 2 dads ‚Äî and they survived to adulthood (5 minute read)](https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/chinese-scientists-created-mice-with-2-dads-and-they-survived-to-adulthood?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists in China have unveiled a new method for breeding mice with two male parents - the resulting babies can survive to adulthood. It is not the first time scientists have bred mice with two dads, but previous attempts did not result in mice that could live to adulthood. The resulting mice had deficits, including shorter lifespans and infertility. The research could result in a better understanding of imprinting disorders, potentially paving the way to treatments that use gene editing to fix them in humans.

[### You are using Cursor AI incorrectly... (17 minute read)](https://ghuntley.com/stdlib/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cursor has a powerful feature called Cursor Rules. It allows developers to build out a standard library of thousands of prompts rules and then compose them together like Unix pipes. Cursor itself can be used to write and update rules. This article goes over how to use Cursor Rules with examples.

[### Patterns for building realtime features (6 minute read)](https://zknill.io/posts/patterns-for-building-realtime/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Realtime features share changes triggered by one user to other users as the changes are happening. This typically means servers need to send data to a set of clients that don't know they are missing data. This post contains a collection of patterns for building realtime features that rely on a connection between the client and server, where the server can notify the client of some data. The connection can be anything that allows the server to send data to the client without the client knowing that there is new data.

[### The Anthropic Economic Index (9 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/the-anthropic-economic-index?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Anthropic Economic Index is an initiative aimed at understanding AI's effects on labor markets and the economy over time. The Index's reports provide data and analysis based on millions of anonymized conversations on Claude.ai. It paints a clear picture of how AI is being incorporated into real-world tasks across the modern economy. Usage is concentrated on software development and technical tasks. AI use leans towards augmentation - its use is more prevalent for tasks associated with mid-to-high wage occupations but lower for both the lowest- and highest-paid roles.

[### Three Observations (6 minute read)](https://blog.samaltman.com/three-observations?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The intelligence of an AI model increases with the resources used to train and run it - it appears that it is possible to spend arbitrary amounts of money and get continuous and predictable gains. The cost to use a given level of AI falls about 10x every 12 months. The socioeconomic value of linearly increasing intelligence is super-exponential.
