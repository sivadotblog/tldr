[### Google will temporarily let Match use alternate payment systems ahead of 2023 trial (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/21/23135768/google-match-alternate-payment-systems-play-store-android-2023-trial-antitrust?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google has reached an interim agreement with Match Group that will allow Match's apps to remain on the Google Play Store while offering alternate payment systems. Match Group will set aside a $40 million escrow fund for payments that occur outside of Google's billing system until an official agreement has been reached. The companies are set to go to trial in April 2023. Epic Games-owned Bandcamp has also reached a similar agreement. The platform will place 10% of its proceeds from purchases made on Android into an escrow fund until Epic's broader antitrust lawsuit against Google moves forward.

[### Amazon tests having drivers make deliveries from local malls (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/22/23136702/amazon-tests-drivers-make-deliveries-from-local-malls-flex?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon is testing a program that will have its contracted Flex drivers pick up and deliver packages from malls. It involves the drivers collecting packages within local shopping centers rather than the post office. The program has been running since last year, but it is unclear where Amazon has been running its tests. Amazon has also been testing a similar service with rural mom-and-pop shops that pays them to deliver packages for the company. Allowing local stores to help with the final leg of deliveries lessens Amazon's reliance on the USPS or UPS.

[### Gene Editing Can Change The Social Behavior of Animals in Unexpected Ways (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/crispr-gene-editing-can-even-alter-the-social-behavior-of-animals?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists used CRISPR to knock out a receptor that is acted on by the hormone vasopressin in hamsters. Vasopressin is linked to social actions, and the team expected that knocking out the receptor would reduce social communication and aggressive behavior. The opposite happened, and the hamsters showed much higher levels of social communication and aggression. The results mean that scientists need to start thinking about the actions of receptors across entire regions of the brain and not just in specific regions.

[### Scientists just broke the record for the highest efficiency solar cell (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/record-highest-efficiency-solar-cell?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory have created a solar cell with a record efficiency of 39.5% under 1-sun global illumination. It has the highest efficiency recorded for any type of cell ever measured in real-world conditions. Earlier experimental cells have reached higher efficiencies, but they only did so under extremely concentrated light. The new cell performs at 34.2% efficiency in space. It is expensive to produce, so researchers will have to reduce the costs before the cell can become widespread.
