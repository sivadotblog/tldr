The first evidence of dark matter may have been discovered. Scientists have spotted a pattern of gamma rays that appears to match the shape of the dark matter halo that spreads out in a sphere from the heart of the galaxy. It closely matches the properties of gamma-ray radiation predicted to be emitted by dark matter. More work is needed to rule out other astrophysical processes and background emissions that could explain the signals.

Scientists have observed centimeter-scale electrical discharges on Mars. The sparks could play an important role in chemical reactions in the Martian atmosphere. They do not pose any danger of electrocution for humans. However, they could disrupt or damage electronic devices over time. Lightning has also previously been observed in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.

Deep work is unlikely unless you deliberately design for it. Your default state is fragmentation - you are not uniquely undisciplined. Dropping just one interruption per hour per day can have a huge effect. Cutting down tasks into smaller chunks can mean the difference between a hellish day and a passable one.

The quantity of AI-generated articles has surpassed the quantity of human-written articles being published on the web. Despite the prevalence of AI-generated articles, they largely do not appear in Google and ChatGPT. The proportion of AI-generated articles has remained relatively stable over the last 12 months. This is likely because practitioners found that AI-generated articles do not perform well in search.
