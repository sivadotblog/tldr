OpenAI is holding informal talks with Wall Street banks about a potential initial public offering in the fourth quarter of this year. 2026 is expected to be a blockbuster year for stock market debuts after a drought. Some on Wall Street are speculating that this year could be the biggest year ever for IPOs. OpenAI, Anthropic, and SpaceX are among the most closely watched tech companies that could go public.

[### How do We Quantify Progress in Robotics? (12 minute read)](https://itcanthink.substack.com/p/how-do-we-quantify-progress-in-robotics?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Offline data sets don't work because robots never do exactly the same thing. These errors compound. Robots are hardware plus an algorithm, and hardware factors often matter more to task execution than the algorithm being used. Any real benchmark by necessity should look like a human competition. There are already early versions of such events, like the World Humanoid Games. However, major companies right now have too much to lose and too little to gain to bother competing.

An artificial lung system built by a team at Northwestern University successfully kept a critically ill patient alive long enough to enable a double lung transplant. The surgery involved temporarily replacing the patient's entire pulmonary system with a synthetic surrogate. The patient lived for two days without lungs. They received donor lungs after 48 hours, when their body was no longer suffering from sepsis. The patient has returned to a normal, independent life with excellent lung function.

Generative AI will make engineers better. While it may make the gap between the median and the max engineer shrink, the gap between the great and the best engineers is about to get much larger. The top engineers of the AI future will probably utilize a different skill set than the top engineers of today.

It's now possible to replace services with AI-generated code, if you know what you're doing. It's only going to get easier. SaaS businesses that don't give ongoing value are at risk of being replaced by customers. The ease of developing these tools will mean that buying and selling SaaS businesses will become less profitable.
