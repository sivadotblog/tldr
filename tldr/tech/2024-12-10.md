[### Tesla Model Q is reportedly coming in first half 2025: Here's what it will cost (3 minute read)](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-q-price-specs-rumor/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Tesla Model Q will launch in the first half of 2025 and cost less than $30,000 with subsidies, or $37,499 if Trump cancels the IRA tax credit. It will be built on Tesla's existing lines. Tesla told investors during its Q3 earning calls that it planned to develop a more affordable model in H1 2025. The Model Q will be 15% smaller and 30% lighter than the Model 3. It will have a steering wheel and pedals but will be geared toward autonomous driving functionality.

[### Quantum Computers Cross Critical Error Threshold (11 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-computers-cross-critical-error-threshold-20241209/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have shown that adding more qubits to a quantum computer can make it more resilient. The scientists transformed a group of physical qubits into a single logical qubit and then showed that the logical qubit's error rates dropped sharply as they added more physical qubits to the group. The result has thrilled quantum computing researchers, but the technology still has a long way to go. There are still many challenges to overcome before quantum computing becomes a viable technology.

[### Blue Origin says New Glenn on track to launch before end of 2024 (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/blue-origin-says-new-glenn-on-track-to-launch-before-end-of-2024/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Blue Origin says it's on track to launch New Glenn before the end of the year, but it is still waiting on regulatory approval to conduct a final key test of the rocket. The hot fire test will involve powering up all seven of the first stage's BE-4 engines and firing them to full thrust while the rocket sits on the pad. It is designed to mirror how the vehicle will operate during lift-off. The 320-foot-tall rocket will be capable of carrying 45 metric tons to low Earth orbit.

Jobs in financial services companies are more desirable than they have ever been. Banks say they are still aggressively hiring. Compensation is similar for comparable roles across tech and banking. However, tech companies are no longer rolling out the red carpet for their employees. Banks are increasingly looking to publicize their AI work, invest in pure research departments, and focus on upskilling and internal development.

[### The ‚ÄúQuiet Quitting‚Äù Myth is Toxic for Tech (1 minute read)](https://blackentropy.com/the-quiet-quitting-myth-is-toxic-for-tech/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The idea that $300k/year engineers are doing next to nothing as a norm in tech is damaging and ridiculous. The myth misleads aspiring engineers, fuels layoff culture, and damages the industry's reputation. While it is true some employees coast, glorifying this idea only perpetuates toxicity. Engineers should instead focus on creating realistic expectations, better leadership, and healthier work cultures.
