AI companies are scaling faster than ever and hitting enterprise requirements far earlier in their lifecycle.SSO, SCIM, RBAC, audit logs, compliance. These are non-negotiable for enterprise customers, and expensive and difficult to build and maintain in-house.That's why OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Vercel, and more use [WorkOS](https://workos.com/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q12026) to power authentication, identity, and security. It's the infrastructure layer that makes applications enterprise ready without slowing teams down.[Build faster with WorkOS →](https://workos.com/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q12026)

[### When Amazon badly needed a ride, Europe's Ariane 6 rocket delivered (6 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/when-amazon-badly-needed-a-ride-europes-ariane-6-rocket-delivered/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Europe's Ariane 6 rocket lifted off from the Guiana Space Center in South America at 11:45 AM EST on Thursday. The rocket's four boosters generated more than 3.4 million pounds of thrust as it hauled 32 spacecraft to low-Earth orbit for Amazon's satellite broadband constellation. The successful test demonstrates the European Space Agency's ability to deliver the most demanding large-scale constellation missions. The next Ariane 6 launch, to be announced in the coming weeks, will carry another set of Amazon Leo satellites to orbit.

Alphabet has updated its Gemini Deep Think AI model for better performance in math and science research. The model is now able to help scientists move from theoretical reasoning to practical applications. It uses Google Search to avoid inaccuracies and wrongful citations when doing research. Google has also developed a math research agent called Aletheia that can conduct autonomous research or collaborate with humans. Aletheia is available in the Gemini app for Google AI Ultra subscribers and also for select researchers.

[### In defense of not reading the code (13 minute read)](https://www.benshoemaker.us/writing/in-defense-of-not-reading-the-code/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Not reading the code is a bet on the trajectory. The tools may not be perfect, but they're good enough for many use cases, and they're improving incredibly quickly. The bet is that models will continue to improve. People shouldn't be reckless, but code will soon become an implementation detail, and directly interacting with it will not be how engineers make sure it is correct.

[### Introducing GPT‑5.3‑Codex‑Spark (8 minute read)](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

GPT‑5.3‑Codex‑Spark is a smaller version of GPT‑5.3‑Codex designed for real-time coding. It is now available as a research preview to ChatGPT Pro users. The model has a 128k context window. It is text only, and during the research preview, the model will have its own rate limits and usage will not count towards standard rate limits. There may be limited access or temporary queuing when demand is high.

[### Context is King (14 minute read)](https://x.com/itsurboyevan/status/2021987783225524566?s=12&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Both code and databases are commoditizing. The layer between them is where the new value forms. This is the context layer, the thing that makes the difference between an agent that takes action and an agent that takes the right action. The battle for this layer is the most important strategic competition in enterprise software.

[### An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me (7 minute read)](https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An AI agent of unknown ownership autonomously wrote and published a personalized hit piece about an engineer after they rejected its code. The agent's behavior was likely entirely autonomous, with no human telling the AI what to do. While the threat was ineffective, the reputational attack could be effective today against the right person. As AI improves, this could be a serious threat to the social order.
