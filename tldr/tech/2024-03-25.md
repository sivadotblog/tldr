According to Elon Musk, Neuralink's 'Blindsight' product is already working on monkeys to restore vision. The resolution is pretty low, but researchers are looking for ways to increase the clarity of images. It is unclear whether the monkeys were born blind and how much of their optic nerves were still intact. The device could be made available to far more people if Neuralink was able to bypass both the eye and the optic nerve.

One of the reasons for Nvidia's dominance is its years and billions of dollars in investment into the CUDA ecosystem. It may be possible in the future for competing projects to take over, but it will take quite a while for the impacts of Nvidia's heavy long-term strategy to go away.
