[### Fast-Charging EV Batteries With Nickel Foil (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-battery-fast-charging?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new lithium-ion car battery with added nickel foil in its interior can recharge to 70% in 11 minutes for a roughly 400 kilometer range. Batteries perform better when hotter, up to a point. The nickel foil helps the battery heat up more, increasing its performance. The battery lasts for roughly 2,000 cycles when charged to 70%, for a range of about 804,000 kilometers.

[### Record-breaking chip can transmit entire internet's traffic per second (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/telecommunications/optical-chip-fastest-data-transmission-record-entire-internet-traffic/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Engineers have created an optical chip that can transmit data at a rate of 1.84 petabits per second, almost twice the global internet traffic per second. The new world record was set using a single light source and a single optical chip. The data was transmitted down a 7.9-kilometer-long optical fiber. The researchers claim that with further development, the system could eventually reach speeds of up to 100 petabits per second.
