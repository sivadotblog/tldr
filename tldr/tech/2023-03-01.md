### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists target ‚Äòbiocomputing‚Äô breakthrough with use of human brain cells (5 minute read)](https://archive.ph/Bm67H?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An international team of scientists led by Johns Hopkins University has proposed the development of a biological computer powered by human brain cells that could outperform existing silicon-based machines while using less energy. This 'organoid intelligence' would be made of neural structures grown from stem cells connected to sensors and output devices and trained with machine learning. It could take decades to develop this technology into a commercial product, and there are ethical considerations regarding the potential for the computer to gain consciousness. All ethical issues will be continuously assessed by teams of scientists, ethicists, and the public.

[### Inside the lab that‚Äôs growing mushroom computers (5 minute read)](https://www.popsci.com/technology/unconventional-computing-lab-mushroom/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Fungal computers are a new development in computing technology that use mycelium, the web-like root structure of the fungus, to act as conductors and electronic components. Compared to conventional computers, mushroom computers are more fault tolerant, reconfigurable, and consume very little energy. They can mimic the spiking activities and patterns used by neurons in the brain to communicate signals. Stimulating mycelium at two points increases conductivity between them, allowing memory to be established.

[### The lone developer problem (2 minute read)](https://evanhahn.com/the-lone-developer-problem/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The 'lone developer problem' is when a single programmer builds something, making it difficult for others to maintain later. Solo programmers often understand and build systems that make sense to them but not to future readers. This can be an issue even for great programmers. To avoid this solo developers could bring in another developer to review the code, try code pairing, or open-source the code. It is not always necessary to solve this problem as it's not always necessary to write good code.
