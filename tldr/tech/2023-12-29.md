Apple's hardware can finally go toe to toe with some of the best PCs. The company is now aiming to make another attempt at becoming a gaming powerhouse. Its previous attempt in 1999 did not go so well. Now, Apple has larger and more capable teams with plenty of resources, and the company is used to playing the long game. This article looks at Apple's history with gaming, its hardware developments in recent years, and the company's push to make its systems more game-friendly.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### The first EV with a lithium-free sodium battery hits the road in January (2 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/the-first-ev-with-a-lithium-free-sodium-battery-hits-the-road-in-january-214828536.html?guccounter=1&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

JAC Motors is launching an electric vehicle with a sodium-ion battery through its Yiwei brand. Sodium-ion batteries have lower density than lithium-ion batteries, but their lower cost, more abundant supplies, and superior cold-weather performance make them viable for mass EV adoption. The Yiwei EV will have a 252 km range with a 25 kWh capacity. Deliveries of the vehicle will begin in January.

[### A Game-Changing Vaccine Could Lower 'Bad' Cholesterol by 30% (2 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/a-game-changing-vaccine-could-lower-bad-cholesterol-by-30?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have been able to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels using a vaccine based on a non-infectious virus particle that targets a protein known to have an important relationship to LDLs. LDLs can cause dangerous blockages in the arteries, reducing oxygen flow to the heart or causing blood clots that can lead to a stroke. The vaccine was able to reduce the bad cholesterol by up to 30% in animal models. It will still be a while before the technology can be used in humans, but it promises a solution that would be more affordable than current options and last around a year per dose.

Apple and medical device maker Masimo have been entrenched in a legal battle over a single feature on the Apple Watch for over three years. Masimo had sued a startup on similar grounds in 2018 and won. Both cases involved employees who helped the companies develop similar technologies. The International Trade Commission's US import on Apple's watches was quickly paused on appeal. The US Customs and Border Protection will make a decision on January 12 on whether the changes Apple made to the watches are significant enough to avoid a patent dispute.

This post by Vitalik Buterin takes a look at the core values of the crypto movement and how they have changed. Crypto isn't just about creating isolated tools and games - it's about building holistically toward a more free and open society and economy where the technological, social, and economic parts fit into each other. web3 had a similar vision to build a set of technology that could together form the base layer of a more open internet stack. Unfortunately, these visions have faded somewhat into the background.
