Apple's newly released developer betas for iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 contain the company's first set of AI features, including a Siri with an updated design and ability to maintain context across multiple requests, new Mail features like smart replay and email summaries, and natural language search in Photos.

Beta testers will need to join a waitlist for access to the features.

[### YouTube's war on ad blockers continues, now making ads truly unskippable (2 minute read)](https://mashable.com/article/youtube-black-screen-ad-blockers?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Multiple YouTube users are reporting that the site is serving them with blank ads or black screens before a video when they are using an ad-blocker extension. The change makes users wait for their content, partially defeating the purpose of using an ad blocker. YouTube began testing server-side ad injection last month to further render ad blockers obsolete. The solution inserts ads directly into the main YouTube video feed so that ad blockers can no longer distinguish the two pieces of media.

SpaceX will begin returning its Dragon crew and cargo capsules to splashdowns in the Pacific Ocean sometime next year and end recoveries of the spacecraft off the coast of Florida.

Debris from several Dragon missions have been discovered on properties over the past couple of years. SpaceX is unaware of any structure damage or injuries caused by this debris.
