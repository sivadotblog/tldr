[### A New Way to Achieve Nuclear Fusion: Helion (30 minute video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bDXXWQxK38&amp;t=1s?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This video looks inside Helion Energy's facilities. Helion's Trenta fusion generator is a completely novel approach to achieving nuclear fusion. It creates two mirrored rings of plasma on each side of the reactor and fires them at each other sequentially, activating powerful magnets to squeeze and compress the rings. The collision raises the plasma temperature to tens of millions of degrees and creates a fusion reaction, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process.

[### Scientists Create a Vaccine Against Fentanyl (3 minute read)](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-create-a-vaccine-against-fentanyl-180981301/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at the University of Houston claim they have a new vaccine that blocks fentanyl from entering the brain. Rats that received the vaccine during tests could produce anti-fentanyl antibodies that stop the drug's effects and allow it to exit out of the body via the kidneys. The vaccine did not cause any adverse side effects or cross-react with other opioids. The researchers still need FDA approval to begin clinical trials, but they hope that the vaccine could be sold within three to four years.
