[### Meta has built an AI supercomputer it says will be world‚Äôs fastest by end of 2022 (5 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/24/22898651/meta-artificial-intelligence-ai-supercomputer-rsc-2022?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta's new AI Research SuperCluster will be one of the world's fastest AI supercomputers. Development on the supercomputer is expected to complete later this year. It will be used to train a range of systems across Meta's businesses and design experiences for the metaverse. AI supercomputers require much less accuracy than traditional supercomputers, so they can not be directly compared. While theoretical performance numbers can be impressive, it is common for supercomputers to run at less than 25% of their peak performance during real-world applications.

[### AI2 shows off an open, Q&A-focused rival to GPT3 (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/ai2-shows-off-an-open-qa-focused-rival-to-gpt3/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Allen Institute for AI has revealed a language model a tenth the size of OpenAI's GPT-3 with on par or better performance. Macaw is good at tracking who did what, but it still has some quirks. The model was not designed to replace GPT-3 but to add to the research advancing language generation and understanding. A smaller model would be more practical for general use. The team is still working on explaining how the Macaw model generates its answers.

[### The Future of Psychedelic Medicine Will Be Drugs You‚Äôve Never Heard Of (15 minute read)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7v3dq/the-future-of-psychedelic-medicine-will-be-drugs-youve-never-heard-of?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Research on psychedelic compounds has boomed in the last few years. Many companies are now springing up in the psychedelic sector with the aim of creating new analogs of drugs similar to the psychedelics known today. Companies that create new psychedelics can patent them. These companies are creating compounds that alter the psychedelic experience to cater to different uses. There will likely be a range of psychedelics with niche uses in the future, similar to how there are a range of drugs for many conditions now.
