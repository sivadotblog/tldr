[### Scientists discover anti-aging gene that rewinds heart age by 10 years (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/health/anti-aging-gene-rewinds-heart-age?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have discovered a gene in centenarians that helps protect them against diseases linked to aging. Giving the gene to middle-aged mice stopped the decay of heart function and rewound their heart's biological clock ages by the human equivalent of more than 10 years. The treatment was also shown to be effective in human cells in test tube experiments. The researchers are now testing to see whether giving people the protein produced by the gene is therapeutically sufficient, as protein-based treatments are safer and more viable than gene therapy.
