[### Apple reportedly developing new smart home doorbell with support for Face ID (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/22/apple-face-id-doorbell-bloomberg-report/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is rumored to be working on a new smart home doorbell with advanced facial recognition. It will be able to integrate wirelessly with smart home locks and allow people to automatically unlock their doors with just a face scan. Apple is expected to expand its reach in the smart home market significantly next year. It plans to release a new smart home control device that will attach to walls and potentially a speaker base.

[### OpenAI announces o3 and o3-mini, its next simulated reasoning models (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's latest AI 'reasoning models', o3 and o3-mini, are now available for public safety testing and research access. The model family was called 'o3' rather than 'o2' to avoid potential trademark conflicts with British telecom provider O2. o3-mini will offer low, medium, and high processing speeds, with the higher compute settings producing better results. It outperforms o1 on the Codeforces benchmark.

The Parker Solar Probe will make its closest approach yet to the Sun on Christmas Eve. It will fly into the solar atmosphere for the first time. It is estimated that the probe's heat shield will have to endure temperatures in excess of 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The mission is aimed at finding the birthplace of solar wind.

[### The Risk of Cancer Fades as We Get Older, And We May Finally Know Why (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/the-risk-of-cancer-fades-as-we-get-older-and-we-may-finally-know-why?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While the risk of cancer rises in our 60s and 70s, it drops past the age of around 80. A study in older mice found that they had higher levels of a protein that caused cells to act as if they were deficient in iron, which in turn limited their regeneration rates, restricting both healthy growth and cancerous tumors. The same processes were found to be occurring in human cells too. Cell growth capabilities were boosted when levels of the protein were artificially lowered or iron was artificially increased.

Monolith is a deep learning framework for large scale recommendation modeling. It features collisionless embedding tables, which guarantees unique representation for different ID features, and real time training, which captures the latest hotspots and helps users to discover new interests rapidly. Monolith supports batch/real-time training and serving.

[### Building effective agents (18 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The most successful implementations of large language models across industries were built with simple, composable patterns rather than with complex frameworks or specialized libraries. This article guides readers on how to build effective AI agents. AI agents are systems that dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage. They maintain control over how they accomplish tasks. Most applications won't need agents - they are the best option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale.

[### The Next Great Leap in AI Is Behind Schedule and Crazy Expensive (16 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-gpt5-orion-delays-639e7693?st=FtmQo2&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's GPT-5 project is expensive and behind schedule. It isn't clear when, or if, it will work. Microsoft had expected to see the model around mid-2024. There may not be enough data to train the model to make it smart enough. OpenAI recently turned to a technique called 'reasoning' to make its large language models smarter. It just released a new reasoning model smarter than anything else the company has released before, but there is still no word on when GPT-5 is coming.

[### Google CEO Sundar Pichai says search giant has slashed manager roles by 10% in efficiency drive (2 minute read)](https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/business/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-says-company-slashed-manager-roles-by-10/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google has slashed a tenth of its managerial roles since last year. Some of the managers were shifted to individual contributor roles and are no longer responsible for other employees. The company had identified 'durable cost savings' as one of its key goals for the year. Google this year has also slashed hundreds of jobs across multiple divisions, including ad sales, core engineering, and the hardware division responsible for the Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit.
