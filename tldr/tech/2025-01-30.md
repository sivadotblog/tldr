[### Bardeen introduces the AI Copilot for GTM teams: ‚ÄúIt's like an Ironman suit for GTM professionals üöÄ‚Äù (Sponsor)](https://www.bardeen.ai/posts/the-ai-copilot-for-gtm?utm_source=newsletter-sponsor&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tldr-1-30-2025)

GTM teams are drowning in tool bloat.

Companies spend [$4,830 per employee who use 275 SaaS apps](https://www.bardeen.ai/posts/the-ai-copilot-for-gtm?utm_source=newsletter-sponsor&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr-1-30-2025) on average, and these tools rarely talk to each other, forcing precious human hours to be spent acting as glue.

[Bardeen's AI Copilot](https://www.bardeen.ai/contact-sales?utm_source=newsletter-sponsor&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr-1-30-2025) is here to restore productivity and sanity. Lead sourcing, outreach, sales ops, reporting, competitive intelligence‚Ä¶ if it grows your business, Bardeen can automate it fully end-to-end.

Companies like Deel, Miro, and Kearney are already using it to rocket past competitors.

[### Elon Musk claims Tesla will launch a self-driving service in Austin in June (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/elon-musk-claims-tesla-will-launch-a-self-driving-service-in-austin-in-june/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk claimed during a recent earnings call that Tesla plans to launch a paid ride-hailing robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. The vehicles will use the yet-unreleased 'unsupervised' version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving software. That software is expected to be released to Tesla owners in California and other regions in the US this year. Tesla owners will not be able to add their cars to the Tesla ride-hail fleet until at least next year.

[### China secretly building world's largest nuclear fusion laser, US satellite exposes (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/energy/china-secret-nuclear-fusion-facility?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China is developing a laser fusion research facility in the southwestern region of the country. It will be larger than the US National Ignition Facility, the current world's largest inertial confinement fusion facility. The new development could have huge implications for both nuclear weapons research and clean energy production. China has not revealed the purpose of the facility.

[### Stem cells used to partially repair damaged hearts (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/stem-cells-used-to-partially-repair-damaged-hearts/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A group of German researchers have developed a method for repairing the heart using new muscle generated from stem cells. The results are promising and they have started clinical trials. The technique involves creating sheets of cells and combining them into a single patch that can be attached to the heart's exterior. In experiments, the scientists found that the added tissues integrated into the hearts functionally and immature stem cells did not form tumors. The implants weren't problem-free - some of the stem cells in the sheets appeared to be uncommitted to a mature state and one animal generated an immune response to the implanted cells.

Kubernetes History Inspector is a log visualization tool for Kubernetes clusters that transforms vast quantities of logs into an interactive, comprehensive timeline view. It is an invaluable tool for troubleshooting complex issues that span multiple components within Kubernetes clusters. The tool uses existing logs, allowing users to troubleshoot past issues as long as logs are still available. Examples of the interactive timeline visualizations the tool produces are available in the repository.

[### On DeepSeek and Export Controls (28 minute read)](https://darioamodei.com/on-deepseek-and-export-controls?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

DeepSeek's achievements make export control policies more existentially important than they were a week ago. Export controls keep democratic nations at the forefront of AI development. The idea that the technology getting cheaper and more powerful is a reason to lift export controls makes no sense - they are one of the most powerful tools for preventing authoritarian governments from behaving aggressively on the world stage. DeepSeek's release is roughly on the expected cost reduction curve, which big tech has already factored into its calculations - it will still require billions of dollars of infrastructure to make AI that is smarter than almost all humans at almost all things.

[### Zuck shrugs off DeepSeek, vows to spend hundreds of billions on AI (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/zuck-shrugs-off-deepseek-vows-to-spend-hundreds-of-billions-on-ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mark Zuckerberg said during Meta's first-quarter earnings call on Wednesday that the company will be investing very heavily in AI this year. Meta considers DeepSeek a new competitor, but it says that it is way too early to tell if demand for chips will stop increasing, as they are still crucial for inference. The company is aiming to make Llama 4 the world's most competitive model. Llama 4 is expected to have multimodal and agentic capabilities.
