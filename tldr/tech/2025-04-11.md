[### ChatGPT's memory can now reference all past conversations, not just what you tell it to (4 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/chatgpts-memory-can-now-reference-all-past-conversations-not-just-what-you-tell-it-to/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is rolling out improvements to ChatGPT's memory and making it a default for the chatbot to reference past conversations. The chatbot will now draw on past conversations to deliver more relevant and useful responses across all modalities on the platform. While AI long term memory could be useful for many tasks, some users are concerned with the privacy implications of the feature. Users are able to turn the feature on or off in ChatGPT settings.

[### Google Pixel 9a review: All the phone you need (14 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-pixel-9a-review-all-the-phone-you-need/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google's new Pixel 9a has most of what makes flagship Pixel phones so good at a $499 price point. While the cheaper price point means a trade-off in materials, charging, and the on-device AI capabilities the device has compared to its pricier siblings, none of those are deal-breakers. The modestly-priced phone, which will have lengthy support, could be the perfect purchase in a period of uncertainty for imported gadgets.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Neutrinos Are Shrinking, and That's a Good Thing for Physics (4 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/science/neutrinos-mass-physics.html?unlocked_article_code=1.-k4.kjnl.NuiCUYpP0f3_&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new study published in the journal Science sets a new upper limit for the mass of a neutrino. Neutrinos are prolific across the cosmos - they are created virtually anytime atomic nuclei snap together or rip apart. They carry no electric charge and are notoriously difficult to detect. Learning more about neutrinos will help cosmologists fill in more knowledge about the universe, including how galaxies clustered together and what influences the expansion of the cosmos. Uncovering the exact values of the mass of neutrinos could lead to new physics.

[### Cells are swapping their mitochondria. What does this mean for our health? (10 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01064-5?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mitochondrial transfer - when mitochondria skip from cell to cell on demand - has been observed in a wide variety of cells and in organisms as diverse as yeast, molluscs, and rodents. It isn't clear yet why mitochondria are so mobile, but there are hints that cells donate their mitochondria to neighbors during times of need. The implications for human health are still a mystery. It is unclear whether mitochondrial transfer happens inside the human body.

smartfunc turns docstrings into LLM-functions. It features schemas, inner function prompt engineering, support for async functions, and a debug mode. A video demo is available in the repository.

[### .localhost domains (1 minute read)](https://inclouds.space/localhost-domains?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It's possible to configure private, custom domains for local webapps, so instead of having to remember and type 'localhost:4333', you can simply navigate to 'appname.localhost'. The process involves setting up each app as a launchd daemon that listens to a unique port, configuring /etc/hosts to redirect traffic to 127.0.0.1, and then redirecting traffic from 127.0.0.1 to the right port for the domain. This post provides more details on the process.

[### AI 50: AI Agents Move Beyond Chat (3 minute read)](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-50-2025/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Companies are using AI agents and reasoning models to take on real enterprise workflows. Startups are moving from AI that merely responds to prompts to AI that solves problems and completes entire workflows, producing real business results. Startups focused on robots have made meaningful strides as they integrate models built using transformers with hardware. Companies this year will prove that AI can be trusted with meaningful workloads and deliver real results - next year, enterprise gains will start spilling into everyday life.

[### This is how Apple's big Siri shake-up happened, per report (3 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/10/this-is-how-apples-big-siri-shake-up-happened-per-report/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple experienced a major internal shake-up related to Siri last month. The company's struggles in AI were partly tied to its militant stance on user privacy and also poor leadership. Members of the Siri team at Apple were surprised at the features that the company demoed at WWDC last year as they didn't even have working prototypes. There seems to be more optimism within Apple that Siri is in good hands now.
