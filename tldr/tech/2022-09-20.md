While the information needed for programming anything is usually just a click away, it can be difficult to sort through this information and it is also unreliable if a stable internet connection is an issue. API Documentation Browsers allow developers to have easy access to information on all relevant APIs. This article introduces Dash, an API Documentation Browser, and shows how it can be used to improve productivity. While it focuses on Dash, most of the article is applicable to all other API Documentation Browsers.
