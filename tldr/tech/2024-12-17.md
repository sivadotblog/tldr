[### Ask HN: SWEs how do you future-proof your career in light of LLMs? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42431103&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Large language models are becoming a part of software engineering. The technology could replace a lot of engineers, so younger engineers may feel like they need to find a way to future-proof their careers. The technology is still very new and can't produce professional code. There's also a lot more to being an engineer than coding, so many senior developers feel confident that it will be a while until AI can replace software engineers, if ever.

Amazon is a leading indicator of a new era of flattening in corporate structure. Its slashing of manager roles isn't just about cost cutting, but a glimpse into the future of work.

It is estimated that the company could cut as many as 14,000 management positions, which would result in $2 billion to $4 billion in savings.
