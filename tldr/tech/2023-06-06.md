A new study has found that a commonly-used eye drop could help slow the progression of nearsightedness in children. The eye drop is used to dilate pupils before eye exams. Children in the study who used the eye drops at bedtime had slower myopia progression than those who received a placebo, resulting in a lower prescription for glasses. Few side effects were reported.

[### Lung cancer pill cuts risk of death by half (3 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/04/lung-cancer-pill-cuts-risk-of-death-by-half-says-thrilling-study?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A late-stage study led by researchers at Yale University showed that taking the drug osimertinib after lung cancer surgery reduced the risk of patients dying by 51%. The study looked at whether the drug could help patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the disease. Everyone in the trial had a gene mutation found in about a quarter of global lung cancer cases. Earlier trials of the drug showed that it also halves the risk of a recurrence of the disease.

[### Major Reddit communities will go dark to protest threat to third-party apps (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Some of Reddit's biggest communities are planning to set themselves to private on June 12 over the site's new API pricing. The protest is planned to go on for 48 hours, but some subreddits will go away permanently until the issue is adequately addressed. Reddit's new API pricing will mean that many third-party apps will no longer be able to operate. Many subreddit moderators rely on third-party apps to manage their communities and the loss of these apps will significantly impact their ability to moderate efficiently. A link to a complete list of the communities taking part in the protest is available in the article.
