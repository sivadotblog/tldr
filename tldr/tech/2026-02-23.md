[### Crusoe BYOM: 5x Higher Throughput for Custom Models (Sponsor)](https://www.crusoe.ai/cloud/managed-inference?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=bring_your_own_model_launch)

You've built the perfect fine-tuned model. Now scale it without compromise. Generic cloud infrastructure wasn't designed for proprietary architectures, leading to performance bottlenecks. Crusoe's Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) changes that. Powered by MemoryAlloy™ technology, Crusoe optimizes its inference engine specifically for your unique weights.

The result? 5x higher throughput and breakthrough Time-To-First-Token speed compared to stock vLLM. Maintain total IP ownership with dedicated capacity and "glass box" visibility. Stop letting infrastructure hold back your AI innovation and start scaling with precision.

[### Apple's Next Big Thing Is a Push Into Visual Artificial Intelligence (14 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-22/apple-s-ai-wearables-push-what-to-expect-from-march-4-low-end-macbook-launch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTgxOTg2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNDI0NjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQVYyU0FLR0NURlAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIwOThFNzNDQTE5QTA0RDkxODEyQzQ4MjcwRDZERTI0QiJ9.Je6L_ItPYwVNmLLYJH4OOQJ4XUfHrttAFL2X_QIlFls&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The defining feature of Apple's push into wearable AI devices will be Visual Intelligence. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been dropping hints about AI wearables built around AI technology that can see the surrounding environment and use that context to take action. The company is working on its own visual models with the intention of making them central to its upcoming set of AI devices, which include advanced AirPods, smart glasses, and a pendant. Apple plans to hold its first product launches of the year in March.

[### Can OpenAI Build Alexa Before Amazon Can Build ChatGPT? (5 minute read)](https://spyglass.org/openai-smart-speaker/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI and Amazon are currently racing to execute an AI device strategy. Interestingly, Amazon reportedly plans to invest $50 billion into OpenAI's newest funding round. Amazon is also the largest shareholder in OpenAI's chief startup rival, Anthropic. New reports suggest that OpenAI may be building custom models for Amazon's products, even while it is hard at work on its first devices.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Have we leapt into commercial genetic testing without understanding it? (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/have-we-leapt-into-commercial-genetic-testing-without-understanding-it/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Polygenic scores tally the contributions of many genes to particular traits to predict certain outcomes. They are probabilistic, not deterministic, as many traits are determined by environmental factors as well as genes. Potential parents using IVF are now able to choose embryos based on their polygenic scores. While it is understandable that parents want to give their kids the best chance of success, the practice may have unintended consequences on the human gene pool, not to mention the ethical implications.

[### AI Data Centers Turn to High-Temperature Superconductors (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-data-centers-hts-superconductors?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft is exploring the potential use of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) as a replacement for copper wiring. HTS could improve energy efficiency by reducing transmission loss. It could also increase the resiliency of electrical grids and limit the impact of data centers on communities by reducing the amount of space required to move power. Microsoft has invested $75 million into Veir, a superconducting power technology developer, to advance the technology.

[### How OpenAI's Codex Team Works and Leverages AI (16 minute read)](https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/how-openais-codex-team-works-and?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's Codex team has reimagined how an engineering organization can function in an AI-native world. The team operates with a high level of trust, autonomy, and speed. Decision-making is fast, ownership is clear, and individuals are empowered to build end-to-end. The team has truly embraced AI as a way to be more productive. AI is treated as a first-class teammate that shapes planning, execution, review, onboarding, and iteration. This allows the team to move with startup-level velocity while working on some of the most complex systems in the world.

[### Code Mode: give agents an entire API in 1,000 tokens (6 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/?utm_campaign=cf_blog&amp;utm_content=20260220&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_source=twitter/)

Cloudflare has introduced a new MCP for the entire Cloudflare API that uses Code Mode. The server can provide access to the entire Cloudflare API over MCP while consuming only around 1,000 tokens. Code Mode is a technique for reducing context window usage during agent tool use. It involves letting the model write code against a typed SDK and executing the code safely in a Dynamic Worker Loader instead of describing every operation as a separate tool. The code acts as a compact plan, and the model can explore tool operations, compose multiple calls, and return just the data it needs.

[### Entirely Foreseeable AWS Outages (3 minute read)](https://rys.io/en/182.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon Web Services experienced at least two minor outages at the end of last year caused by malfunctions in its internal AI tooling. These outages were entirely foreseeable, even by employees. Large language models are extremely complex systems, and this complexity creates real risk. Amazon never misses a chance to point to 'AI' when it is useful, but when there's an outage, suddenly it's just a 'coincidence' that AI tools were involved.

[### Atoms are Cheap, Process is Pricey (42 minute read)](https://futureblind.com/p/atoms-are-cheap-process-is-pricey?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Fast feedback loops allow you to get ideas to reality more quickly. This pattern is seen in every successful frontier tech effort. The common thread is treating reality as the teacher and getting to class as often as possible. Iterate fast, and validate using reality instead of thinking your way to perfect solutions.
