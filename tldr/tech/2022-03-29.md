[### Maybe you should do less 'work' (3 minute read)](https://www.johnwhiles.com/posts/work.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Some developers finish their assigned workloads faster than expected and then they ask for more similar work to do. Part of the reason for this is to try to reach a standard that they have already met. Constantly overworking can lead to burnout. Finding other activities to do along with work that can benefit both you and your employer, such as skill development, will help prevent burnout while improving your value as an employee.
