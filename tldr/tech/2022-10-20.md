[### Why we're leaving the cloud (4 minute read)](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Renting computers is mostly a bad deal for medium-sized companies with stable growth. The cloud excels when applications are simple and have low traffic or when loads are irregular. Using the cloud at other times results in higher operating costs without much benefit. Up until very recently, everyone ran their own servers, and it can still be the right decision for many companies to continue doing so.
