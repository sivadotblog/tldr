[### ‚ÄòGodfather of AI‚Äô quits Google with regrets and fears about his life‚Äôs work (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23706311/hinton-godfather-of-ai-threats-fears-warnings?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Geoffrey Hinton, one of the 'Godfathers of AI', has quit his job at Google to speak freely about the risks of AI. He says that a part of him regrets his life's work. Hinton's work directly led to the development of technologies like ChatGPT and Google Bard. He claims that competition with new AI technologies will be impossible to stop and result in a world with so much misinformation that people won't be able to tell what is true anymore. The technology could also eliminate jobs, and possibly humanity itself, as it starts learning to write and run its own code.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists develop A.I. system focused on turning peoples' thoughts into text (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/01/scientists-develop-ai-system-focused-on-turning-thoughts-into-text.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Semantic decoders are AI systems that can translate people's brain activity into streams of text. They can be used to benefit patients who have lost their ability to physically communicate. Researchers at the University Of Texas have developed a semantic decoder system using a transformer model. It doesn't require any surgical implants and it can produce text that closely or precisely matches the intended meaning of words around half the time. The decoder still can't be used outside of a lab setting as it requires an fMRI scanner, but the researchers believe that they could eventually make a more portable system.

[### Timber! The World‚Äôs First Wooden Transistor (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/wood-transistor?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A collaboration of researchers through the Wallenberg Wood Science Center have created the world's first wooden transistor. It is three centimeters across and switches at less than one hertz. The transistor works by electrochemically modulating conductivity within conducting channels inside the wood's pores with the help of a penetrating electrolyte. It could be used for specialized applications, including biodegradable computing and implanting into living plant material.
