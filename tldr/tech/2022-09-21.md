[### Disentangling the Facts From the Hype of Quantum Computing (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-quantum-week?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The field of quantum computing has seen a lot of hype over the last few years. Companies have started to shift their timelines back, and the industry may be moving into a phase of the hype cycle called the 'trough of disillusionment'. Humans are still a long way from achieving quantum practicality, but progress towards that goal is accelerating. The industry needs to continue its evolution of qubit counts and quality improvements. It will likely be over a decade before anything of compelling value will be realized.

[### The Asymmetry of Open Source (26 minute read)](https://matt.life/writing/the-asymmetry-of-open-source?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Volunteer open source development has given us the majority of all open source projects. Open source work is generally funded through companies or through the project itself. Developers with incomes reliant on their open source projects have more pressures to survive and will have different priorities to serendipitous open sourcers. This article discusses how reliant developers source income for their projects and where money comes from when software is free.

[### YouTube‚Äôs ‚Äòdislike‚Äô and ‚Äònot interested‚Äô buttons barely work, study finds (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23356434/youtube-dislike-not-interested-buttons-bad-recommendations-mozilla-report?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mozilla researchers have found that YouTube's 'not interested', 'dislike', 'stop recommending channel', and 'remove from watch history' buttons are largely ineffective at preventing similar content from being recommended. The 'stop recommending channel' button was found to be the most effective. A YouTube spokesperson has confirmed the behavior was intentional as the platform doesn't try to block all content related to a topic, opinion, or speaker. They criticized the study, saying that it didn't take into account how YouTube's systems work.
