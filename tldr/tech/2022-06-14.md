[### ‚ÄòBiological age‚Äô startups: why do people want to know how close they are to death? (7 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jun/13/biological-age-startups-why?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Biotechs are now offering test kits that claim to be able to measure the biological age of the user. Biological age aims to quantify the aging of the body's functions and predict mortality. It is a better predictor of morbidity risk than chronological age. None of the test kits available have been approved by the FDA and there are no treatments for improving biological age. For now, the tests should be treated as entertainment rather than an accurate diagnosis method.

Musk recently told his employees to return to the office full-time, while Twitter employees are allowed to work from home or wherever they feel most productive.
