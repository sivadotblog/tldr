The library also uses the Apache Arrow Feather format, which is quick to parse, compresses well, and can copy directly to the GPU without JavaScript transformation. It runs in completely static settings, making it possible to host million-point scatter plots over services such as GitHub Pages.

[### Chrome just shipped WebGPU without flags (5 minute read)](https://twitter.com/benmschmidt/status/1644122769108418567?s=46?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google Chrome has shipped WebGPU in the Version 113 Beta. WebGPU is a programming interface that sits on top of many low-level languages and allows developers to write GPU code that can run on most smartphones and computers with a web browser. One significant improvement is the inclusion of 'compute shaders', which permits the writing of programs that process data and convert it into something new. WebGPU is intended to execute math functions quickly, making it capable of performing various tasks, including conducting inference on machine learning models or performing multiplications on data frames. It will eventually be available on other web browsers.
