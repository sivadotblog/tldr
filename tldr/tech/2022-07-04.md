[### Methane converted into methanol at room temperature ‚Äì just add light (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/science/methane-methanol-conversion-room-temperature-catalyst/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have developed a new technique to convert methane to methanol by using a metal-organic framework (MOF) as a catalyst. The technique involves mixing methane and oxygen into water and then pumping it through the MOF catalyst. Exposing the catalyst to sunlight triggers a reaction that converts the gas into liquid methanol, which can be easily extracted and converted into valuable products. The technique could reduce methane emissions and the environmental footprint of methanol production.
