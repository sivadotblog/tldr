[### Should developers be evaluated based on lines of code written? (Sponsor)](https://www.swarmia.com/engineering-metrics/?utm_campaign=TLDR&amp;utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=cpv&amp;utm_content=december22)

Elon Musk asked Twitter engineers to print out their code for review. Does a bigger stack of papers make you a better engineer?

[Swarmia](https://www.swarmia.com/engineering-metrics/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=email&utm_medium=cpv&utm_content=december22) wants engineering leaders to measure [non-toxic metrics](https://www.swarmia.com/engineering-metrics/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=email&utm_medium=cpv&utm_content=december22) ‚Äî including DORA and SPACE ‚Äî and ignore harmful leaderboards or individual performance data.

What can you measure with Swarmia? Cycle time, deployment frequency, investment distribution, bug insights, batch size‚Ä¶

What can‚Äôt you measure with Swarmia? Number of commits, lines of code (sorry Elon!), code churn and rework.

[### The Day The AGI Was Born (6 minute read)](https://archive.ph/3tSip#selection-1381.107-1403.1?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

ChatGPT is a huge leap from GPT3. It can explain scientific and technical concepts in different styles and help with brainstorming. The model has a long-term memory of up to 8,192 tokens and can take input and generate output about twice as long as GPT3. ChatGPT is chat-focused, so users can talk back to it, modify what it generates, or have it continue existing conversations without prompt engineering. The model meets some definitions of artificial general intelligence.

[### Apple Makes Plans to Move Production Out of China (14 minute read)](https://archive.ph/7bP4j?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple plans to move its production outside of China. It is looking at assembling its products in India and Vietnam. Apple's suppliers have been told to plan more actively for production in other parts of Asia. There have been violent protests at the Foxconn factory in China, where iPhones and other Apple products are made. The protests have disrupted production, causing Apple to reconsider its reliance on the plant.

[### Physicists Create a Holographic Wormhole Using a Quantum Computer (18 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-create-a-wormhole-using-a-quantum-computer-20221130/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Physicists from the California Institute of Technology claim to have created a wormhole using a quantum computer. The wormhole emerged like a hologram out of quantum bits of information. The physicists could manipulate the qubits and send information through the wormhole. The experiment is evidence for the holographic principle, which says that space-time and gravity emerge from quantum effects.

[### What‚Äôs next for lab-grown human embryos? (13 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02343-7?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The International Society for Stem Cell Research has relaxed its 14-day rule on culturing human embryos in the lab. Scientists still have to abide by local laws, and many countries have laws restricting stem cell research. Culturing embryos for more than 14 days could lead to a better understanding of the causes of pregnancy loss and congenital birth defects. Around 14 to 22 days is when the body's main pattern emerges. This stage holds clues on how cells differentiate into tissues and organs, which could boost regenerative medicine.
