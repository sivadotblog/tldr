Elon Musk has announced the formation of xAI, a company aimed at understanding the true nature of the universe. Musk and the operator of his family office incorporated X.AI in March and there were reports that Musk was in talks for potential funding of a new AI startup in April. xAI‚Äôs core team will be led by Musk himself. The team will have an array of talent from across the AI industry. xAI will maintain close ties with Twitter and Tesla to achieve its mission. The company plans to host a Twitter Spaces chat on Friday to give the public a chance to ask questions.

[### Apple releases first public betas of iOS 17, macOS 14 Sonoma, and other new OSes (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/apple-releases-first-public-betas-of-ios-17-macos-14-sonoma-and-other-new-oses/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The first public betas of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS, and macOS 14 Sonoma are now available. These builds are essentially identical to the third developer betas released last week. Public betas are usually signals that OSes are approaching the level of stability and polish required for a public release. Updates to all OSes include improved autocorrect, new iMessage and AirDrop features, separate profiles for Safari, an Enhanced Private Browsing feature, and the removal of 'Hey' from the 'Hey Siri' activation phrase.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Chinese company wins race for first methane-fueled rocket to orbit (9 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/07/chinese-company-wins-race-for-first-methane-fueled-rocket-to-orbit/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese firm LandSpace is the first company ever to send a methane-fueled launcher into orbit. LaunchSpace's Zhuque-2 rocket was launched at 9 pm ET on Tuesday from the Jiuquan spaceport in the Gobi Desert. The launch mission was a complete success. Methane is the preferred fuel for rockets due to its high density and warmer boiling point. It also deposits less soot inside engines, making the engines easier to clean and reuse. Future explorers on Mars may be able to tap into natural resources to produce their own methane rocket fuel.

[### The deep-sea gold rush is beginning (2 minute read)](https://www.semafor.com/article/07/12/2023/deep-sea-mining-gold-rush?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Deep-sea mining could begin within the next two years. A handful of companies backed by countries hungry for nickel, manganese, and other minerals needed for clean energy are ready to forge ahead with deep-mining projects. An obscure UN agency called the International Seabed Authority is finalizing regulations for the emergent industry. Around a dozen countries currently support a temporary or permanent halt to deep-sea mining, but a majority vote by the ISA's 167 member states is required to stop the practice. Approval of the practice will almost certainly set off an undersea gold rush.
