[### Tesla Leak Shows That Musk's Vision Is Trembling (3 minute read)](https://futurism.com/tesla-leak-cheap-musk-vision?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla sales are down considerably worldwide. Banks say that Elon Musk has created a 'code red situation' by overinvesting his time in the US Department of Government Efficiency. Tesla's brand has taken a hit due to Musk's public persona and many customers have returned their vehicles to distance themselves from him. Musk's bet on the future of self-driving tech over cheaper vehicles has lowered investor confidence in his vision. Musk announced that there will be a live company update during the earnings call today.

[### The Justice Department and Google battle over how to fix a search engine monopoly (5 minute read)](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/21/nx-s1-5369404/google-doj-opening-statements-remedies-trial?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It was nearly a year ago when US District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google had acted illegally to maintain a monopoly - over the next several weeks, lawyers for Google and the Justice Department will face off again to determine what penalties will be levied against Google. Google maintains that it will appeal the decision once the remedies phase of the trial is complete. The company argues that the Department of Justice's proposed remedies would hurt American customers, the economy, and US tech leadership and innovation.

[### Crypto Knocks on the Door of a Banking World That Shut It Out (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-knocks-on-the-door-of-a-banking-world-that-shut-it-out-082b3968?st=oThiVq&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

President Trump's pledge to make the US a bitcoin superpower has set the stage for crypto to become more intertwined with the banking system. Several crypto firms are planning to apply for bank charters or licenses. Some are interested in national trust or industrial bank charters, which would enable them to operate more like traditional lenders, while others are after relatively narrow licenses that would allow them to issue stablecoins. Firms that obtain a bank charter will become subject to stricter regulatory oversight.

Biomanufacturing is a fragmented field, but the diffusion of these technologies is a 'when, not if' question. This article discusses more than 40 Nobel-worthy technologies that could further the field. The premise of synthetic biology remains compelling as its applications are wide-ranging with large markets and the underlying tech continues to improve non-linearly. Whoever figures out how to combine these technologies will have access to massive markets.

[### Python's new t-strings (5 minute read)](https://davepeck.org/2025/04/11/pythons-new-t-strings/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Python 3.14, which will ship in late 2025, will contain a feature called template strings (t-strings) that opens the door to safer and more flexible string processing in Python. f-strings have become a very popular way to format strings and are being used for everything - even when they shouldn't. t-strings are a generalization of f-strings that must be processed before they can be used. This post provides a quick overview of how to use the new feature.

[### Event-Hidden Architectures (6 minute read)](https://skiplabs.io/blog/event-hidden-arch?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Events are a useful mechanism for transmitting state and data among application resources, but they are a miserable experience for developers and operators alike. The event-driven approach was necessary early in the decade but it isn't any longer. Today's modern abstractions mean that developers don't need to learn the unique quirks of low-level infrastructure or understand the overall application architecture just to build or enhance their part of the application. Event-hidden grants engineers new powers while simplifying engineering. It enables developers to build feature-rich, scaled, and distributed applications without having to interact with events, queues, and the industry of patterns, frameworks, and consultants that came with them.

[### Impact, agency, and taste (9 minute read)](https://www.benkuhn.net/impact/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

High-leverage work has two interrelated components: agency (a combination of initiative/proactiveness and relentlessness and resourcefulness) and taste (a good intuition for what things will work and what won't). These can be improved through practice. This article contains specific advice on how to improve on these dimensions. It is important to be able to reflect on your own work and thought processes and figure out how to improve them.

[### What I'd do as a College Freshman in 2025 (3 minute read)](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/04/what-id-do-as-college-freshman.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While many are spooked by large language models, college freshmen should still study computer science - being supported by AI tools is not a substitute for mastery. Tech rewards leverage, not shortcuts. Freshmen should optimize for momentum and stack useful skills, relationships, and systems. Understand trends but don't chase them - ride the ones that match your strengths and learn to take a step back and aim for depth, clarity, and direction.
