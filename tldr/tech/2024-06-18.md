[### TDK claims insane energy density in solid-state battery breakthrough (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/tdk-claims-insane-energy-density-in-solid-state-battery-breakthrough/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Japanese company TDK claims it has made a material that provides an energy density of 1,000 watt-hours per liter, about 100 times greater than TDK's current batteries. The material will enable smaller device sizes and longer operating times. It offers a higher degree of stability and safety, but its fragility makes it impractical for use in cars or smartphones. TDK plans to start shipping samples of its new battery prototypes to clients next year before moving into mass production.

[### Scientists preserve DNA in an amber-like polymer (7 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2024/scientists-preserve-dna-amber-polymer-0613?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

MIT researchers have developed an amber-like polymer that can be used for long-term storage of DNA. It can store DNA at room temperature while protecting the molecules from damage caused by heat or water. The DNA can be easily removed from the polymer without damage. The process of embedding DNA into the polymer takes a few hours, but the researchers believe that the process can be sped up with further optimization.
