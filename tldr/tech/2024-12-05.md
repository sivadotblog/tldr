[### Google's DeepMind tackles weather forecasting, with great performance (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/googles-deepmind-tackles-weather-forecasting-with-great-performance/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google DeepMind claims that its GenCast system outperforms traditional computing methods of weather forecasting out to at least a week and often beyond. GenCast merges some computational approaches used by atmospheric scientists with a diffusion model, resulting in a system that maintains high resolution while cutting the computational costs significantly. It has relatively low computational requirements, so individual academic research teams will likely be able to experiment with it.

[### GPS-alternative tech swaps satellites for Earth fingerprints (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/advanced-navigation-mbda-terrain-fingerprint-navigation/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Australian firm Advanced Navigation and European missile manufacturer MBDA are developing a new navigation system for planes to replace GPS in situations where the system fails, such as when signals are intentionally jammed by enemy forces. Their system uses a downward-facing neuromorphic camera to read the terrain's 'fingerprint'. This data is cross-referenced against an existing database of fingerprints, allowing the aircraft to ascertain its exact geographical location. The system is reportedly simple enough that it doesn't use any AI. The companies have planned a real-world demonstration of its system later this year in Australia followed by a commercial rollout of the technology.

[### A First Look at S3 (Iceberg) Tables (10 minute read)](https://meltware.com/2024/12/04/s3-tables.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AWS' S3 Tables brings native support for Apache Iceberg to S3. This post takes a look at the new offering, which is an exciting development for the data analytics ecosystem. S3 has now launched three major features in 12 months, suggesting that something material has shifted in S3's development culture. The fact that AWS chose to call the new feature 'S3 Tables' and not 'S3 Iceberg' could mean that the company is open to supporting other table formats in the future.

[### Sam Altman Downplays the Dangers of A.I. and Musk (3 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/dealbook/sam-altman-openai-elon-musk.html?unlocked_article_code=1.fE4.eYyl.PPGM3YJ7GxD5&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sam Altman says that AI technology will be able to mirror human capability sooner than most people realize, but that this would matter much less than many have predicted. He recently claimed that the company would be able to achieve artificial general intelligence in the next few years at a conference in New York City. He has downplayed the rising tensions between him and Elon Musk, especially concerning due to Musk's increasingly close relationship with President-elect Trump, saying that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power to hurt competitors and advantage Musk's own businesses.
