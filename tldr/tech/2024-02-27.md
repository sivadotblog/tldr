[### Peering through Lenovo‚Äôs transparent laptop into a sci-fi future (7 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/24082244/lenovo-concept-transparent-laptop-mwc-2024-drawing-tablet?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Lenovo's ThinkBook Transparent Display Laptop is a 17.3-inch notebook with a see-through screen. Its bezel-less MicroLED display offers up to 55% transparency when its pixels are set to black or turned off. The display becomes less and less see-through as its pixels light up. Due to technical challenges, the laptop's display resolution is only 720p and it is not currently possible to manually set the whole laptop screen to be opaque. The laptop has a flat touch keyboard as its base that is also designed to work as a drawing tablet. Pictures of the device are available in the article.

[### The Odysseus lunar lander is on its side and will likely run out of energy soon (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24083973/odysseus-lunar-lander-tipped-over-intuitive-machines?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Odysseus lander will likely stop operating today as its panels and antennas aren't oriented exactly as planned, making it difficult to generate power and communicate. The lander almost failed its landing due to issues with its range finder lasers, but a last-minute software patch allowed engineers to use one of NASA's experimental LIDAR systems to retrieve the required data to ensure its safe landing. Despite this, Odysseus landed on its side. The only cargo on the side facing down is a piece of art sent by a commercial customer.

justpath is a utility for exploring the PATH environment variable in both Windows and Linux. It can only view the PATH variable - neither justpath nor any of its child processes can modify the shell PATH directly. justpath provides a modified version of PATH that can later be used in a shell startup script or with an environment manager.

[### In Defense of Thin Wrappers (7 minute read)](https://jaredhecht.com/in-defense-of-thin-wrappers?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many apps find that their variable costs start skyrocketing once they get some form of traction and grow. Having to deal with these issues when growing is really hard as developers have to effectively rebuild their engines while it's running. Founders can get in front of this issue by planning ahead, having multiple choices for infrastructure, finding good advisors, developing better negotiation skills, and raising more money than needed as a buffer. This article discusses how to handle rising costs as a startup, with a particular focus on AI-based projects.

[### Decoding Apple's Ploy To Scuttle Progressive Web Apps (24 minute read)](https://infrequently.org/2024/02/home-screen-advantage/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple plans to stop supporting Progressive Web Apps on March 6. The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) mandates that Apple must allow competing browsers on its App Store. Apple's response to this is to geofence browser choice and kneecap web apps. This choice will break many apps across the EU, affecting schools, governments, startups, gamers, and more. None of this is required by the DMA, despite Apple blaming its decision on the law. By doing this, Apple is cementing a future where the mobile web will never be permitted to grow beyond marketing pages for native apps.
