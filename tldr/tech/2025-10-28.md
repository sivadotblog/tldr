[### Amazon to announce largest layoffs in company history, source says (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/amazon-to-announce-sweeping-corporate-job-cuts-starting-tuesday.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon is expected to start informing employees about sweeping job cuts starting today. It plans to lay off as many as 30,000 staff across its corporate workforce. The layoffs are part of a broader cost-cutting campaign that started during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said earlier this year that the company's workforce could shrink further as a result of generative AI.

Anthropic gets about 80% of its revenue from corporate customers, of which it has around 300,000. Its Claude language models have been praised for their aptitude in coding. Anthropic is surprisingly close to OpenAI in revenue. It expects to get to a $9 billion annual run rate by the end of the year, a big lead in revenue per user over OpenAI.

Sam Altman's Merge Labs is a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup. It recently hired an award-winning biomolecular engineer, Mikhail Shapiro. Shapiro's past work suggests that the startup could be aiming to create a device that could link to the brain using sound waves. If Merge Labs is successful, its device may be preferable to Neuralink's BCI as it wouldn't require surgery.

[### Why IP address truncation fails at anonymization (18 minute read)](https://00f.net/2025/10/27/ip-anonymization/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Truncated IP addresses are still personal data under GDPR, especially when combined with other information that most systems routinely collect. Subnet size doesn't correlate with user anonymity. The network prefix itself contains enough information for trivial identification. Many organizations are creating compliance risks by thinking IP truncation is GDPR-compliant anonymization. What is actually needed is encryption specifically designed for IP addresses.

[### Easy RISC-V (71 minute read)](https://dramforever.github.io/easyriscv/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This is an introductory tutorial to RISC-V assembly programming intended for those with a basic familiarity with low-level computer science concepts. RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture started its life at UC Berkeley. It is an open standard with a clean design that is quickly gaining steam and has found great success in many areas of application. The tutorial covers the 32-bit bare bones RV32I\_Zicsr instruction set with a tiny subset of the privileged architecture.

[### Musk's Wikipedia rival site live after crashing on launch day (2 minute read)](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/28/wikipedia-musk-elon-grokipedia?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Grokipedia crashed shortly after it launched yesterday. It was live late evening with nearly 900,000 articles. Many entries closely resemble their Wikipedia counterparts, but Elon Musk's views shape how some topics are framed. For example, his own Grokipedia page features a 'Recognition and Long-Term Vision' section instead of Wikipedia's 'Accolades'.

[### More Big Companies Bet They Can Still Grow Without Hiring (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/companies-hiring-jobs-ai-9ef675b6?st=79YL5D&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Companies in the US are increasingly making the calculation that they can keep the size of their teams flat, or even shrink them, without harming their businesses. Part of this is the belief that artificial intelligence will be used to automate more processes, but companies are also hesitant to make moves in an uncertain economy. The widespread caution in hiring is frustrating job seekers and leading many employees within organizations to feel stuck in place. Operating with fewer people can pose risks for companies by straining existing staff or hurting efforts to develop future leaders.
