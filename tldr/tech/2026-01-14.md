Meta and EssilorLuxottica are discussing potentially doubling production capacity to 20 million units or more by the end of the year to capture growing demand and head off rivals. They may potentially further establish the capability of producing more than 30 million units if demand justifies such a move. No final decisions have been made yet. The talks signal confidence that smart glasses can move beyond early adopters and reach mass-market scale.

China's Institute of Radio Spectrum Utilization and Technological Innovation has filed a request with the International Telecommunications Union to operate a satellite constellation with a total of 193,428 satellites. The request far exceeds the ambitions of other current constellation projects. The Chinese constellations plan to use a wide range of radio frequencies and will be deployed across numerous orbits from 300 to 600 kilometers, as well as higher objects at around 20,000 kilometers. The US Federal Communications Commission views China's satellite ambitions as a national security threat.
