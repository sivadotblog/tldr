[### OpenAI defines five 'levels' for AI to reach human intelligence ‚Äî it's almost at level 2 (2 minute read)](https://qz.com/openai-five-level-system-human-intelligence-ai-1851588122?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI recently shared a five-level system for tracking its artificial general intelligence progress. The levels go from what is currently available to AI that can perform the same amount of work as an organization. They may change based on feedback from employees, investors, and the company's board. OpenAI executives believe the company's AI is currently on the first level, but it is getting close to level two, where AI can perform basic problem-solving.

SpaceX employees are working on the design and details of a Martian city. Teams are working on habitats and spacesuits to combat the planet's hostile environment. The initiatives are still in their infancy. Elon Musk told SpaceX employees in April that he expects one million people to be living on Mars in about 20 years. Musk's vision for Mars underlies most of the six companies that he leads or owns - each could potentially contribute to an extraterrestrial colony.

[### Scientists Discover a New Hormone that Can Build Strong Bones (6 minute read)](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/07/428011/scientists-discover-new-hormone-can-build-strong-bones?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Davis recently discovered that Maternal Brain Hormone (CCN3) increases bone density and strength in mice. The hormone's effects explain how women's bones remain relatively robust even as calcium is stripped from their bones to support milk production. Mice with increased CCN3 had dramatic increases in bone mass and strength over the course of weeks, regardless of age and sex. The hormone can be administered through a hydrogel patch applied directly to the site of a bone fracture.

Humanity has discovered an estimated 0.001 percent of all microbes. Most scientists work with E. coli, which is easy to handle and experiment with in the lab. The Cultivarium is a non-profit that aims to democratize access to extraordinary microbes as it believes that the next biological breakthrough will come from these overlooked microbes. It will build tools to grow, transform, and engineer microbes such as the salt lovers, heat tolerators, and geyser growers that have long been inaccessible to scientists.

[### mandala (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/amakelov/mandala?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

mandala eliminates the effort and code overhead of ML experiment tracking by allowing researchers to automatically save, query, and version Python computations. It can capture the inputs, outputs, and code of Python functions, automatically organize executions of imperative code into a high-level computation graph of variables and operations, query relationships between variables, and automate exploration and high-level operations. Tutorials are available.

[### AWS Secrets Manager Agent (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/aws/aws-secretsmanager-agent?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The AWS Secrets Manager Agent is a client-side HTTP service that standardizes the consumption of secrets for the Secrets Manager across Amazon environments. It can retrieve and cache secrets in memory so applications can fetch secrets from localhost instead of making calls to the Secrets Manager. The agent can only make read requests and can't modify secrets.

More companies have started experimenting with unique vesting schedules to attract more talent while also saving money. This article highlights a few of these companies and their vesting schedules. Many of the grants typically net lower than they used to.

The NetChoice decision by the Supreme Court last week is poised to affect a host of tech legislation still being developed as well as current lawsuits, including the pending First Amendment challenge to the TikTok 'ban' bill. The decision states that tech platforms can exercise their First Amendment rights through their content moderation decisions and how they choose to display content on their services. It has clear ramifications for laws that attempt to regulate platform algorithms. This article looks at how the decision will influence legislation and its impact on current lawsuits.
