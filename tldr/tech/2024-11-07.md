[### Google's Jarvis AI extension existence leaked on the Chrome store (1 minute read)](https://www.androidpolice.com/google-jarvis-ai-extension-accidentally-leaked/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google's Jarvis AI extension was leaked for a brief time on the Chrome Web Store. The store page described Jarvis as a helpful companion that surfs the web. It supposedly works by taking and analyzing screenshots, similar to Apple's 'onscreen awareness' and Microsoft Recall. The extension will likely go live after Gemini 2.0's official release, which should be sometime next month.

[### A new stronger Ozempic is coming. Here's what to know (3 minute read)](https://qz.com/novo-nordisk-cagrisema-ozempic-1851691005?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Novo Nordisk's CagriSema combines semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, with an amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist. Amylin helps regulate blood sugar levels while calcitonin controls calcium levels in the blood. An early-stage clinical trial of CagriSema found it helped patients lose more weight faster compared to the highest dose of Wegovy. Late-stage trials of the drug are expected later this year and in the first half of 2025.

[### SpaceX to launch Starship for the sixth time this month (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/spacex-to-launch-starship-for-the-sixth-time-this-month/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The sixth flight test of SpaceX's Starship may be as soon as November 18. It will have many of the same objectives as the previous test, which is part of the reason for the fast approval. SpaceX will also attempt to relight one of the Starship's six Raptor engines in orbit, test new secondary thermal protection materials, and stress the limits of flap control to gain data on future landing profiles. Its engineers have introduced a number of upgrades to the system, including more redundancy in the booster propulsion system and updated software controls.

[### How WebSockets cost us $1M on our AWS bill (9 minute read)](https://www.recall.ai/post/how-websockets-cost-us-1m-on-our-aws-bill?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Inter-process communication (IPC) can result in enormous AWS bills if done inefficiently. Recall.ai discovered that its Python WebSocket client and Chromium's WebSocket implementations were calling two functions that were taking up a majority of its CPU time. This article looks at how the company discovered the issue, why it chose to use WebSockets in the first place, and how it fixed the issue and reduced the CPU usage of its bots by up to 50%. This exercise in optimizing IPC for CPU efficiency reduced Recall.ai's AWS bill by over a million dollars per year.

[### TikTok Canada Unit Ordered to Dissolve Operations on National-Security Concerns (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/canada-orders-tiktok-canada-unit-to-dissolve-operations-on-national-security-concerns-a9d9e8f2?st=NJcWx2&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Canada has ordered TikTok Technology Canada to dissolve its business operations due to national security concerns. TikTok says the order would eliminate hundreds of jobs and isn't in anyone's best interest. It will challenge the order in court. The Canadian government will not be blocking citizens' access to the TikTok app or their ability to post content on the platform. Banning the company and not the app could make things worse as the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.

[### Once thought a fantasy, effort to sequence DNA of millions of species gains momentum (5 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/article/once-thought-fantasy-effort-sequence-dna-millions-species-gains-momentum?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Earth BioGenome Project, which started six years ago, aims to sequence the genomes of essentially all known eukaryotes. While the project is still short on funds and years behind schedule, it is no longer pure aspiration. The project has now sequenced 3,000 genomes and is on track to reach 10,000 species by 2026. Project leaders now hope to meet the 1.67 million species goal by 2032. Advances in DNA sequencing technology will help lower the costs of the project.
