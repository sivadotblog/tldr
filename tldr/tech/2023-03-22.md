[### Here‚Äôs how NASA plans to replace the International Space Station‚Äîby becoming a private company‚Äôs tenant (4 minute read)](https://www.fastcompany.com/90867049/heres-how-nasa-plans-to-replace-the-international-space-station-by-starting-a-bidding-war-between-contractors?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NASA is planning to retire the International Space Station (ISS) in 2030 and rent space on one or more privately built stations. The transition is part of NASA's effort to shift to a job-to-be-done approach, where contractors are given a task rather than a specific vehicle or system to produce. NASA's first commercial-station contract was awarded to Axiom Space in 2020. NASA plans to award a second round of contracts leading to the purchase of station services from up to two companies.

[### The Quest for Injectable Brain Implants Has Begun (5 minute read)](https://archive.ph/j46OT?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While brain implants have the potential to significantly improve patients' lives, the brain and metal do not work well together. Electrodes can cause injury and scar tissue, which in turn makes devices less effective. To avoid this problem, a team of scientists has designed a gel that can be injected into tissues and solidifies into an electrically conductive polymer. This polymer electrode is harmless and can be moved just as easily as the brain tissue around it. The gel could enable flexible electronic neural implants in the future.

[### America‚Äôs banks are missing hundreds of billions of dollars (6 minute read)](https://archive.ph/SGBnK#selection-633.27-633.59?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Depositors of failed bank Silicon Valley Bank did not want physical currency but instead requested their balances be wired elsewhere. Regulators promised to protect the clients of the failed bank, so no deposits were written off. Deposits in American banks are decreasing, with a 3% fall in commercial banks' deposits over the last year. This reduction in deposits leads to fragile financial systems and requires banks to shrink to repay their deposits. The Federal Reserve's reverse-repo facility, introduced in 2013, is having a profoundly destabilizing impact on banks.
