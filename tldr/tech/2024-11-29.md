The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has warned makers of smart devices that they may be breaking the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act if they fail to disclose how long they will support their products with software updates. The majority of products reviewed by the FTC failed to disclose the device's support duration or end date. Google's AI Overviews may provide incorrect software support information. Many vendors reviewed by the FTC make software support information elusive, sometimes burying the information in specs, support, FAQ pages, or footnotes.

[### Gold-based drug slows cancer tumor growth by 82%, outperforms chemotherapy (4 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/health/gold-based-drug-slows-cancer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from Australia and India have revealed a novel gold-based drug that shows significant promise in the fight against cancer. The new gold compound is 27 times more potent against cervical cancer cells than a widely used chemotherapy drug. It is also 3.5 times more effective against prostate cancer and 7.5 times more effective against fibrosarcoma than current treatments. The compound is tailored to interact with an enzyme abundant in cancer cells. It effectively stops cancer cells from multiplying and developing drug resistance.

Coprolites and paleofeces can be a veritable goldmine of information. They can indicate whether an animal was a carnivore and how they may have eaten their prey. The size and shape can also reveal what type of animal it was. Studies of dinosaur coprolites and paleofeces support the theory that dinosaurs rose to dominance from the Late Triassic Period to the onset of the Jurassic Period as they were better able to adapt to a rapidly changing environment brought about by random processes like volcanic eruptions, climate changes, and other catastrophic events.

[### The Beginning of the End of Big Tech (5 minute read)](https://www.wired.com/story/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-big-tech/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Critique of Big Tech is now commonplace. The collateral consequences of the current Big Tech model - centralization, surveillance, and information control - are too obvious to ignore. This concentration of power leads to things like the CrowdStrike outage that happened in the middle of this year. Big Tech's end will be the beginning of a new and vibrant ecosystem that is actually innovative and built for benefit, not just profit and control.

[### Breaking down the DOJ's plan to end Google's search monopoly (14 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24302415/doj-google-search-antitrust-remedies-chrome-android?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Department of Justice's remedies, aimed at breaking up Google's search monopoly, range from syndicating the company's search results to selling the Chrome browser. The remedies could imperil Google's ability to compete in its core business of search and search advertising. Google could see billions of dollars shaved off its empire. There are several potential buyers for Chrome, but some of the Big Tech companies that might want it, such as Amazon and Meta, would likely be blocked as potential antitrust threats. Chrome could be valuable to large language model companies as it could provide a distribution channel for their services.
