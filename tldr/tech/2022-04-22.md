### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Ultra-light liquid hydrogen tanks promise to make jet fuel obsolete (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/hypoint-gtl-lightweight-liquid-hydrogen-tank/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Gloyer-Taylor Laboratories (GTL) has developed ultra-lightweight cryogenic tanks that have a 75% mass reduction compared with other aerospace cryotanks. A 12 kg tank from GTL is able to hold over 150 kg of hydrogen. The weight reduction means that hydrogen-fueled aircraft may be able to fly at least four times as far as comparable aircraft running on jet fuel while completely eliminating carbon emissions. It could also mean increased cargo or passenger capacity.

[### A new genome reference index could save the genetic diversity of all humans (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/a-new-genome-reference-index-could-save-the-genetic-diversity-of-all-humans?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Human Pangenome Project aims to gather, organize, and make accessible a representation of all genetic diversity found in people. The data could help reveal information about genetic risk for different diseases and conditions for individuals in the future. A technique called 'long read' sequencing will be used to map full genomes from end to end. Some groups are wary of the effort and have rejected the proposal.
