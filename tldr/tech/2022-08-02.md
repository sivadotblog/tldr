[### Google CEO tells employees productivity and focus must improve, launches 'Simplicity Sprint' to gather employee feedback on efficiency (4 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/31/google-ceo-to-employees-productivity-and-focus-must-improve.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google is launching a new effort called the Simplicity Sprint to improve efficiency and employee focus. CEO Sundar Pichai told employees at a meeting last Wednesday that Google's productivity as a company isn't where it needs to be with the headcount it has. The company recently reported its second consecutive quarter of weaker-than-expected earnings. The Simplicity Sprint aims to crowdsource ideas for quicker product development through an internal survey.

[### Scientists Reveal The First Images of Atoms 'Swimming' in Liquid (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/these-are-the-first-images-of-atoms-swimming-in-liquid?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from the UK have used a form of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to capture the motion of single atoms through a liquid. TEM uses a beam of electrons to generate images. The team developed a double graphene liquid cell capable of working with existing TEM technology to image a saltwater solution containing platinum atoms moving on a solid surface of molybdenum disulfide. The images revealed that atoms move faster in liquid and choose different places to rest on solid surfaces.

[### MIT Researchers Created Artificial Synapses 10,000x Faster Than Biological Ones (4 minute read)](https://singularityhub.com/2022/08/01/mit-researchers-created-artificial-synapses-10000x-faster-than-biological-ones/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from MIT have created artificial synapses that are 1,000 times smaller and 10,000 times faster than their biological counterparts. This was achieved by integrating a material that tolerates extreme electric fields, dramatically improving the speed with which ions can move. There are still issues with scaling the technology that need to be solved. The speed and size of the device suggest that the research could eventually develop into hardware that could match or exceed the power of the human brain.

Dell is exploring the ability to wirelessly charge devices on a laptop's surface. It filed a patent which describes a wireless charging clip that can be attached to computers and used to charge devices on top of it. The patent was filed in early 2021 and published last Thursday. The filing doesn't guarantee a future product. Diagrams from the patent filing are available in the article.

[### The Age of Brain-Computer Interfaces Is on the Horizon (3 minute read)](https://archive.ph/zm6rr?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Synchron is a company that makes Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Its devices can read brain signals and convert them into commands like moving a cursor on a screen. Unlike other BCIs currently in development, Synchron's device doesn't require cutting open the scalp and drilling into the skull. It can be implanted through the jugular vein in the neck in a procedure that could send the patient home the very same day. Most neurosurgeons are already up to speed on the basic approach required to put it in.
