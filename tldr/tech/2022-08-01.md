[### Thread is Matter‚Äôs secret sauce for a better smart home (11 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/23165855/thread-smart-home-protocol-matter-apple-google-interview?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Thread is a wireless protocol developed specifically for IoT devices. It is designed to make them work faster, fail less, use less power, and communicate with each other more seamlessly. Thread devices can form a mesh network with upwards of 250 devices. Thread will be the protocol that Matter will use for low-bandwidth devices when it arrives later this year. Many more details about Thread are available in the article.

[### Apple Pay may finally work on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox in iOS 16 (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/30/23284992/apple-pay-compatible-edge-chrome-firefox-ios-16-beta-browsers-safari?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple Pay works with Edge, Chrome, and Firefox in the iOS 16 beta 4. The feature is not available for those browsers on the latest macOS beta, likely due to their underlying engines. Edge, Chrome, and Firefox use Safari's WebKit engine due to Apple requirements. The integration of Apple Pay with other browsers in iOS may be related to the EU's plan to go after companies that force app developers to use their own rendering engines.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### MIT engineers develop stickers that can see inside the body (5 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2022/ultrasound-stickers-0728?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Engineers at MIT have developed a stamp-sized device that sticks to the skin and can provide continuous ultrasound imaging of internal organs for 48 hours. It is able to produce live, high-resolution images of major blood vessels and organs. The stickers were able to maintain a strong adhesion during various activities such as sitting, standing, jogging, and biking. They currently require a wired connection, but there are already many potential uses for them.

[### China‚Äôs AI-driven power grid can recover from a blackout in 3 seconds (3 minute read)](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3186870/chinas-ai-driven-power-grid-can-recover-blackout-3-seconds?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A power grid in China's Xinjiang region can recover from blackouts in just three seconds. The power grid has many sensors that form a powerful AI that can decide the routes of power supply without human intervention. It starts locating and isolating faults and restoring power as soon as an equipment failure occurs in the low-voltage distribution network. The technology will quickly expand to other communities in China.

This article discusses the world of virtual idols and the people behind the characters. The value of business driven by virtual idols was $16 billion in China alone. Many companies in China and Japan have increasingly invested in developing virtual talent over the past decade. These characters are animated personalities who are powered by teams of computer scientists and voice actors. Many of these actors are starting to complain about exhaustion, overwork, and low pay.

[### Shor, I‚Äôll do it (10 minute read)](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=208?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article explains Shor's algorithm without using any math beyond arithmetic. Shor's algorithm is a quantum computer algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer. It could be used to break public-key cryptography schemes if run on a quantum computer with a sufficient number of qubits that can operate without succumbing to quantum noise and other phenomena. The article provides many links for further reading.
