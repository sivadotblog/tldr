Testing slows developers down. Every hour spent investigating failures, fixing flaky tests, or running regressions delays releases and limits what your team can ship.

Tests run in parallel, suites finish in minutes, and failures are real‚Äînot false alarms. Workflows stay current as your app evolves, and brittle tests are repaired automatically.

Developers get clean feedback fast, stay focused on features, and releases ship faster with fewer surprises.

[### Thinking Machines Lab Co-Founder Departs for Meta (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/thinking-machines-lab-co-founder-departs-for-meta-442d7461?st=xPQDHC&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Andrew Tulloch, one of the co-founders of Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab, has left to join Meta. Tulloch previously worked at Meta for 11 years. He is a leading researcher in the field of artificial intelligence and worked at OpenAI before co-founding Thinking Machines Lab. It is unclear what team he will be on at Meta.

[### Inside Apple's Pivot From a ‚ÄòVision Air' Headset to Meta-Like Smart Glasses (13 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-12/inside-apple-s-glasses-pivot-when-apple-is-launching-m5-macbook-pro-ipad-pro?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDMzODY3NywiZXhwIjoxNzYwOTQzNDc3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNDBQQ0ZHUEZIVzIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.R2oEhpyHi84uZE7Gdw45QE2FygsCPrPTxAjoQAHMjiI&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's shift to smart glasses suggests that the company no longer views the Vision Pro approach as a viable mass-market platform. The company doesn't invest heavily into products that lack the potential to become mainstream hits, and it doesn't chase niche markets. Smart glasses are a much more portable and practical form factor that could one day evolve into a future iPhone replacement, something the Vision Pro can never achieve. While Apple may someday decide to make the Vision Air after all, the decision now to focus on smart glasses is the logical path.

[### Scientists Discovered a New Creature That Exists Between Life and Not-Life (4 minute read)](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a65193552/archaea-cell-virus/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sukunaarchaeum mirabile is a cellular entity that offloads certain biological functions onto hosts like a virus, but it also contains the necessary genes to create its own ribosomes and messenger RNA. With just 238,000 base pairs of DNA, Sukunaarchaeum pushes the conventional boundaries of cellular life. Its discovery highlights the vast unexplored biological novelty within microbial interactions.

[### China's 'Darwin Monkey' is the world's largest brain-inspired supercomputer (4 minute read)](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/chinas-darwin-monkey-is-the-worlds-largest-brain-inspired-supercomputer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Darwin Monkey, also known as 'Wukong', is a supercomputer built to emulate a monkey's brain structure. It features over 2 billion artificial neurons and more than 100 billion synapses, roughly on par with the neural structure of a macaque. The supercomputer will serve as a tool for neuroscientists while also acting as a stepping stone toward artificial general intelligence. It consumes just 2,000 watts of power despite being powered by 960 Darwin III neuromorphic chips, each supporting up to 2.35 million spiking neurons.

[### Vibing a Non-Trivial Ghostty Feature (20 minute read)](https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Ghotty's unobtrusive update notification feature was largely developed with AI. This post shares the agentic coding sessions that led to shipping the feature. It provides context about the process and reasoning. AI is best used as an assistant and not a replacement. While AI can do a lot of the work, developers will almost always still need to intervene at times.

ZIPs are a stack of per-file records with an index that documents what's inside and where to find it. It is possible to make a few tiny HTTP requests to quickly inspect a multi-gigabyte archive. This post walks readers through the process with a working demo.

TBPN (Technology Business Programming Network) is a show where Jordi Hays and John Coogan chat about the worlds of tech and business. The show became a sensation practically overnight after its first episode aired last October. Executives from OpenAI, Palantir, and Andreessen Horowitz appear regularly on the show. The show's audience is relatively small, but it considers CNBC and Fox Business to be its competitors. Its fans include Larry Ellison, Mark Cuban, and Travis Kalanick.

[### Self Actualization (2 minute read)](https://boz.com/articles/self-actualization?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

When Andrew Bosworth started Meta's Bootcamp program in 2008, he didn't teach the culture as it was: he taught it as he wished it were. New engineers didn't know the difference. The company grew fast, and within a year, more than half of the engineering team had learned about the culture from him. When onboarding in a high-growth organization, you aren't just teaching people how things work, you're deciding what kind of company they believe they've joined.
