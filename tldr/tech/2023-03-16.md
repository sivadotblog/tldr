[### Interview with OpenAI‚Äôs Greg Brockman: GPT-4 isn‚Äôt perfect, but neither are you (6 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/interview-with-openais-greg-brockman-gpt-4-isnt-perfect-but-neither-are-you/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's GPT-4 is a significant improvement on its predecessor, GPT-3. It allows developers to prescribe its style and behavior more easily and produces more factually accurate statements. GPT-4's image analysis capabilities mean that it can caption and explain the contents of photos. The model shows nearly human-level skill in domains like calculus and law. It still shares limitations with GPT-3, such as hallucinated facts and basic reasoning errors.

[### It Sure Seems Like Amazon Is Making a New Web Browser (2 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-prime-new-web-browser-survey-1850224922?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon sent a survey to its users asking detailed questions regarding what features they would like to see in a new desktop/laptop browser from the company. Users who completed the survey rated the importance of features like text-to-speech, extensions, browser data syncing across desktop and mobile devices, and blocking third-party cookies. Amazon's potential entry into the browser market comes at a time when the ad industry is preparing for a massive change. Google plans to eliminate third-party cookies in the Chrome browser, a primary tool used by businesses for consumer tracking in ads.

NASA has revealed a new spacesuit for the Artemis program created by Axiom Space. The Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) has improved mobility and safety requirements, including added joints and thermal requirements for the Moon's south pole. The prototype features a dark gray color but the real version will be white for thermal reasons. AxEMU will enable movements like walking and picking things up from the ground that were impossible in the older design. Pictures of the suit are available in the article.

[### Design notes on the 2023 Wikipedia redesign (25 minute read)](https://alexhollender.com/wikipedia-2023-redesign?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Wikipedia desktop interface has been redesigned. The last significant change to the interface was made in 2004. Since then, usability for new editors has been improved and the editing experience was updated. However, the general layout and reading experience remained largely unchanged until the redesign began in 2019. Devices have changed significantly since 2004, resulting in the need for a modernized interface. This article contains notes on the redesign of the Wikipedia desktop interface by Alex Hollender, who led the project.

[### The Multi-modal, Multi-model, Multi-everything Future of AGI (8 minute read)](https://lspace.swyx.io/p/multimodal-gpt4?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's latest artificial intelligence language model, GPT-4, has improved significantly from its last iteration, GPT-3. It can perform new tasks like math and help with taxes. GPT-4 is also considered safer, with 20-30% less hallucinations and unsafe content. It is a multimodal model that can read images and text, convert sketches of websites into code, and offer summarizations of images. Currently, access to the API is on a waitlist. The multimodal visual API capability is exclusively available only for BeMyEyes, an assistive app for the visually impaired.

[### OpenAI checked to see whether GPT-4 could take over the world (7 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-checked-to-see-whether-gpt-4-could-take-over-the-world/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI allowed an AI testing group to evaluate the risks of its newly released GPT-4 AI model. The testing group found that GPT-4 was ineffective at autonomous replication. The potential for models capable of being an existential risk to human society is not a new concern. The AI alignment community, fearing that powerful AI systems with superhuman intelligence may be close, wants to mitigate all possible AI harms. The emergence of large language models such as Bing Chat and ChatGPT has given these efforts renewed urgency.

[### How Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant Lost the A.I. Race (8 minute read)](https://archive.ph/YepWM?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant had more than a decade to become indispensable, but they were hampered by clunky design and miscalculations. The tech world is now gushing over AI-powered bots such as ChatGPT. ChatGPT has been used to handle complex tasks like coding software, drafting business proposals, and writing fiction. The excitement around chatbots illustrates how Siri, Alexa, and other voice assistants have squandered their lead in the AI race. Many big tech companies are now racing to come up with responses to ChatGPT.
