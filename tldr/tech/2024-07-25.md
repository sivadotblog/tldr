[### Australian scientists genetically engineer common fly species to eat more of humanity's waste (4 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/24/australian-scientists-genetically-engineer-common-fly-species-to-eat-more-of-humanitys-waste?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Australian scientists have genetically engineered black soldier flies to eat organic waste and produce ingredients for making everything from lubricants to biofuels to high-grade animal feeds. The fly larvae can eat double their body weight a day, consuming waste faster than microbes. They are harvested once they turn into pupae. The scientists have created a company to commercialize their work - they hope to have their first genetically engineered flies for use in waste facilities by the end of the year.

[### Test Flight Demonstrates Navigation by Cellphone Signals (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/gps-alternatives?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There are many natural and man-made threats that could knock out Earth's global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). There were numerous aviation-related incidents from the Baltic to the Atlantic to the Mediterranean Sea in 2024. The US Air Force has a novel backup system that uses cellphone towers to calculate a plane's position. The system is able to track planes for horizontal distances of more than a hundred kilometers at altitudes up to 23,000 feet with precision in single-digit meters.

[### Will Figma become an awkward middle ground? (5 minute read)](https://www.dive.club/ideas/will-figma-become-an-awkward-middle-ground?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Designers who can code are more likely to sketch out their ideas than use Figma. AI will make this workflow more accessible to those who can't code. This will cause Figma to fall into an awkward middle ground. Figma has its users because it takes most people too long to code their designs - AI can turn wireframes into frontend code, extrapolate design systems, and create visuals from screenshots and mood boards. This may cause designers to skip using tools like Figma on the road to shipping software.

[### Developers want more, more, more: the 2024 results from Stack Overflow's Annual Developer Survey (8 minute read)](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/07/24/developers-want-more-more-more-the-2024-results-from-stack-overflow-s-annual-developer-survey/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article discusses the results of the 14th annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey. This year's most popular technologies are JavaScript and PostgreSQL. Rust and Markdown are the most admired. Developers are frustrated with technical debt at work, but they don't see AI as a threat. While most developers use or plan to use AI tools, many don't trust the accuracy of the technology.

[### The AI job interviewer will see you now (7 minute read)](https://restofworld.org/2024/ai-interview-software-hiring-practices/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI job interviews have grown in popularity. The industry is still small and the jobs affected are often large-scale roles where companies need to sift through thousands of applicants at once. Companies in favor of the practice claim that it is less biased as the systems assess candidates on merit without prejudice or mood affecting the decision. Critics say that bias can creep in through the training data. Some candidates are turning to AI themselves - entrepreneurs are now peddling AI services to help people answer interview questions in real time.
