[### Android 16 could give Gemini the power over apps Assistant never got (4 minute read)](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-gemini-app-functions-3502205/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google is working on an API for Android 16 that will let system apps perform actions on behalf of users inside applications. The API will be guarded by a permission granted to the default assistant app. Apps will be able to create functions by defining a service that can only be bound by a system process. Details on the new API are scarce, but it appears it will allow Gemini to control apps in a way that Google Assistant never managed to do.

[### Amazon's Moonshot Plan to Rival Nvidia in AI Chips (20 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-11-24/amazon-plans-to-rival-nvidia-with-its-own-ai-chips?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy)

Nvidia has transformed from a niche chipmaker to the main supplier of the hardware that enables generative AI over the past two years. The demand for the chipmaker's latest hardware will outstrip supply for several quarters. Nvidia's biggest customers, which include cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, are eager to reduce their reliance on - or replace - Nvidia's chips. This article looks at Amazon's chip development journey and how it plans to compete with Nvidia.

[### A Study Says Gray Hair May Be Reversible (4 minute read)](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a62991234/gray-hair-could-be-reversible-new-study/?taid=6741ee14bf681400017cac2f&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthemTWPOP&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter)

Researchers have discovered one of the causes of gray hair: stuck stem melanocyte stem cells. The cells usually travel between compartments of developing hair follicles. They can't make the protein needed to pigment hair when they get stuck, unable to move back to the germ compartment. Making them move again could result in the production of pigment and the return of colored hair.

Astrocytes, non-neuron brain cells, can be artificially manipulated to suppress or enhance specific memories while leaving all other memories intact. These cells play various roles in the brain, many focused on the health and activity of their neighboring neurons. Scientists hope to be able to develop an astrocyte-targeted treatment for disorders such as PTSD.

[### Zero Disk Architecture (8 minute read)](https://avi.im/blag/2024/zero-disk-architecture/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The idea of Zero Disk Architecture is simple: instead of writing to a storage server, write instead to S3. This means you won't have to manage any storage server - this is all offloaded to AWS. The cost and latency of S3 are both going down as the technology improves. While there are still some tradeoffs to consider, Zero Disk Architecture can be very attractive for systems that don't care about latency.

[### Foursquare's 104M Points of Interest (17 minute read)](https://tech.marksblogg.com/foursquare-open-global-poi-dataset.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Foursquare recently made its Points of Interest dataset freely available. This post looks into the dataset. Foursquare was likely earning a good amount of revenue from the dataset as there isn't a lot of competition from the freely available data sets. Companies that produce these datasets can charge yearly rental fees that run into the six-figure territory.

[### Bluesky is on the verge of overtaking Threads in all the ways that matter (2 minute read)](https://mashable.com/article/bluesky-gaining-ground-on-competitor-meta-threads?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Bluesky app has exploded to 3.5 million daily active users. Its user base has increased by 300% since Election Day. Journalists, academics, and companies are fleeing X and going to Bluesky instead of Threads possibly due to Threads' decision to downplay political content on the platform. Bluesky is quickly becoming the platform for political and cultural debate.
