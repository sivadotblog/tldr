Researchers in Germany have demonstrated quantum entanglement of two atoms separated by 33 kilometers of fiber optics, a record distance for this kind of communication. The process involved converting the mediating photons into longer wavelengths so they could travel further through fiber-optics commonly used for telecoms. The research was an important step in realizing a practical quantum internet. It can be paired with satellite technology, which can beam entangled photons over thousands of kilometers.

Many companies won't know what your impact was at previous roles when interviewing for a new role. They will likely judge you on your prestige, background reputation, and how you present during the interview process. A person who spends their time avoiding work with real impact will be unlikely to be successful with companies that value genuine experience. There is only a finite amount of time, so that time should be spent on work on what matters.
