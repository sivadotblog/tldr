Manual testing on personal devices is too slow and too limited. It forces teams to cut releases a week early just to test before submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage, issues slip through.

[### Why Apple Still Hasn't Cracked AI (35 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzYyNTIyMCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ4MjMwMDIwLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0g2Q1NEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.FF_hZTKPfqvLmKYjxyqIMOftNcYSELe7kLAIsST2cKQ&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While Apple has rolled out new AI features just like its competitors, they've mostly been notable for being delayed and underwhelming. The company announced Apple Intelligence last June, but some of the features are still being delayed - the new Siri won't be out in time for next month's WWDC, a year after it was first announced. Apple has devoted considerable resources to the technology and has little to show for it. While some attribute the struggles to decisions made by executives, others see symptoms of a deeper problem within the company.

[### OpenAI introduces Codex, its first full-fledged AI agent for coding (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/openai-introduces-codex-its-first-full-fledged-ai-agent-for-coding/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's Codex is an agentic coding tool that allows experienced developers to delegate rote and relatively simple programming tasks to an AI agent to generate production-ready code. It is a unique interface that can be accessed from the sidebar in the ChatGPT web app. Developers can include an 'AGENTS.md' file to give the agent custom instructions. Codex is built on a fine-tuned variation of OpenAI's o3 reasoning model. It is now rolling out to ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team users - Plus and Edu support will come at a later date.

[### FDA OKs first blood test that can help diagnose Alzheimer's disease (2 minute read)](https://apnews.com/article/alzheimers-blood-test-fda-leqembi-kisunla-ad3cffe0bd540accf47e8ee105b439a9?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A blood test has been approved by US health officials for diagnosing Alzheimer's in patients 55 and older who are showing early signs of the disease. The test identifies a key marker for Alzheimer's, beta-amyloid. The low costs and convenience of the blood test may help expand the use of drugs shown to slightly slow the progression of the disease. Previously, the only FDA-approved methods for detecting beta-amyloid were invasive tests of spinal fluid or expensive PET scans.

[### Laser-powered fusion experiment more than doubles its power output (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/17/laser-powered-fusion-experiment-more-than-doubles-its-power-output/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The team at the US Department of Energy's National Ignition Facility has increased the yield of its net-positive fusion experiment to 8.6 megajoules. They made history in 2022 when they generated 3.15 megajoules in the first controlled fusion reaction to generate more energy than it consumed. While none of the experiments have been effective enough to feed electrons back to the grid, they show that controlled nuclear fusion is more than hypothetical.
