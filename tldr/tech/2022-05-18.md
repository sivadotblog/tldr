[### More data? More problems! (Sponsor)](https://info.skyflow.com/what-is-a-data-vault-tldr?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=tldr+2022)

Just think for a minute about how much data your company has ‚Äî whether you're at a startup or Fortune 500, it's probably a huge amount. And while your company manages a lot of data, only a small amount of it is personally identifiable information (PII) that you must handle carefully to protect customer data privacy. To meet this need, you should isolate PII from your other datasets, while retaining PII usability for key business workflows. Download What is a data vault? to learn how.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### A new generation of nanobots can kill bacteria in your teeth with heat (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/new-generation-nanobots-kill-bacteria-in-teeth?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from the Indian Institute of Science and startup Theranautilus have developed a set of nano-sized cleaning robots that can clean the hard-to-reach areas deep inside dentinal tubules to kill bacteria. The nanobots are made of silicon dioxide coated with iron and they can be controlled using a low-intensity magnetic field. They are able to reach depths of up to 2,000 micrometers inside dentinal tubules, where they generate heat to flush out bacteria. The nanobots can be retrieved once the operation is done. The technology is almost ready for deployment in a clinical setting.

[### A new underwater greenhouse could reveal the future of agriculture (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/nemos-garden-underwater-greenhouse-agriculture?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nemo's Garden is an underwater greenhouse project that uses the ocean's environmental qualities to create a habitat for growing fresh produce. It was designed for regions where environmental, economic, or morphologic factors make plant development challenging. More than 100 different plants have been grown using this method. Tests showed that plants produced in the environment were richer in nutritional content than those grown using traditional methods. The concept is now being exported around the world.
