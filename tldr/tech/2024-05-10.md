[### Leaked Deck Reveals How OpenAI Is Pitching Publisher Partnerships (6 minute read)](https://www.adweek.com/media/openai-preferred-publisher-program-deck/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has been pitching partnership opportunities to news publishers through its Preferred Publishers Program. The company has been courting premium publishers since July last year when it struck a deal with the Associated Press. It has since inked deals with Axel Springer, The Financial Times, Le Monde, Prisa, and Dotdash Meredith. OpenAI negotiates deals on a per-publisher basis rather than structuring all of its deals uniformly. While some publishers have opted to partner with OpenAI, others have sued the tech firm for using copyrighted articles without permission.

[### Dangerous Protocols (32 minute read)](https://summerofprotocols.com/dangerous-protocols-web?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Protocols are a potential alternative to walled technology gardens. They offer a level of interoperability and customization that platforms don't. A historical look at protocols suggests that their purpose has always been to simplify coordination and communication, leading to conformity over time. Protocols are not owned or mediated by any central authority, so switching protocols isn't as easy as switching platforms. While protocols are not necessarily bad, it is important to acknowledge the dangerous implications of increasingly outsourcing more decisions to them.

[### Log scales (9 minute read)](https://briefer.cloud/blog/posts/logarithms/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article contains a lesson on log scales. It covers the basics, like linear scales, before moving on to more advanced topics such as exponentials, symmetry, homoscedasticity, and more. The article uses many charts and graphs to help visualize the concepts it discusses. It focuses on log10, where segments represent a tenfold increase compared to the last, but there are many other types of log bases to also be aware of that offer different perspectives and may be better suited for specific situations or data types.
