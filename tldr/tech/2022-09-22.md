[### The world‚Äôs first Tesla solar neighborhood is becoming reality (2 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2022/09/21/tesla-solar-neighborhood-becoming-reality/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla is deploying solar roofs and Powerwalls in a brand-new development in Austin, Texas. It has partnered with Brookfield Asset Management and Dacra to offer Tesla Solar Roofs and Powerwalls as a package on brand new houses. The project has been going on for a year and there are already quite a few houses in the development with the technology. Homeowners are able to sell excess energy back to the grid, earning them long-term passive income. The installations in the development could eventually be included in Tesla's upcoming Texas virtual power plant.

[### Facebook Parent Meta, Google To Cut Costs And Staff (3 minute read)](https://www.cnet.com/tech/facebook-parent-meta-google-to-cut-costs-and-staff-report-says/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta and Google are looking at ways to cut costs as the companies brace for an economic downturn. Both companies are reportedly cutting staff. Meta is reorganizing departments and giving workers a certain amount of time to apply for other roles within the company. Google is also requiring some employees to apply to new roles. Meta employees have about 30 days to find another job internally and Google employees typically have about 60 days to find another role in the company if their jobs are eliminated.

[### The controversial embryo tests that promise a better baby (14 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02961-9?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Some companies are testing embryos generated by in vitro fertilization to allow prospective parents to choose those with the lowest risks for disease. Pre-implantation genetic testing for polygenic conditions is a relatively new service, with only a small handful of companies selling it in a few countries. The genomic models used in most tests are too weak to predict disease risk in a meaningful way, so people may be misled by the information they receive. There are indications that people who aren't infertile will turn to IVF to take advantage of the testing.

[### OpenAI open-sources Whisper, a multilingual speech recognition system (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/21/openai-open-sources-whisper-a-multilingual-speech-recognition-system/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has open sourced Whisper, a speech recognition system that enables transcription in multiple languages as well as translation from those languages to English. Whisper was trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask data collected from the web. The model is particularly limited in the area of text prediction and it doesn't perform equally well across all supported languages. OpenAI hopes that Whisper will make automatic speech recognition technology more accessible.
