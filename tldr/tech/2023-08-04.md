[### Scientists in Japan Develop Experimental Alzheimer's Vaccine That Shows Promise in Mice (3 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/japan-experimental-alzheimers-vaccine-is-promising-1850700985?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists in Japan have developed a vaccine that can delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease. It appears to reduce inflammation and improve other important biomarkers in the brains of mice with Alzheimer's-like illness. The vaccine is supposed to work by training the immune system to go after senescent cells that produce high levels of a particular protein. Its effectiveness has yet to be formally peer-reviewed and there are still many steps to take before the team even begins thinking about large-scale human trials.

LK-99 is a new material that is said to be a superconductor at room temperature and ambient pressure. A recent post on X from a researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California shows a small piece of the material levitating over a magnet. Some have said this is proof of the superconductivity claims. Others are still skeptical and are waiting for LK-99's properties to be evaluated by more researchers.

[### Introducing code referencing for GitHub Copilot (6 minute read)](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

GitHub has announced a private beta of GitHub Copilot with a new code referencing feature that shows a list of repositories for source code whenever it makes a suggestion based on public code. The feature will allow developers to learn from others' work or use a dependency rather than introduce new app logic. It will also allow developers to more easily give and receive credit for their work. An overview of how GitHub Copilot code referencing works is available in the article.

[### Raspberry Pi availability is visibly improving after years of shortages (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/some-shops-will-let-you-buy-more-than-one-raspberry-pi-at-a-time-again/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Raspberry Pi supply has been hit with shortages for years. Manufacturing numbers have now climbed from 400,000 monthly units to 1 million. Raspberry Pi‚Äôs CEO Eben Upton says that this level of production can be sustained as long as necessary to clear the company‚Äôs customer backlogs and return to free availability. Some suppliers have already removed purchasing restrictions. Upton has previously implied that the company is putting off Raspberry Pi 5 development to allow stock of current models to return to normal.

[### Google‚Äôs Plan To DRM The Web Goes Against Everything Google Once Stood For (15 minute read)](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/08/02/googles-plan-to-drm-the-web-goes-against-everything-google-once-stood-for/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Rather than creating new and useful things, older companies tend to become less innovative and start litigating. This tactic allows them to extract more value while simultaneously suppressing new competitors. Google has clearly reached that stage in some aspects of its business. It is meddling with the Web Environment Integrity system by allowing websites to determine which browsers to serve. This move will ultimately enable Google to effectively block ad-blocking while also eroding the principles of the open web, which Google used to be at the forefront of fighting for.
