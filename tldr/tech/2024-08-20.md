[### Tesla is hiring people to do the robot (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/19/24223626/tesla-optimus-humanoid-robot-motion-capture-training?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla is employing people to wear motion capture suits to help train its humanoid Optimus robot. The position pays up to $48 per hour and requires walking for up to over seven hours a day while carrying up to 30 pounds and wearing a VR headset for extended periods. Employees must also be between 5'7" and 5'11" tall. Optimus may require millions of hours of data before it's fully ready to work in Tesla's factories.

[### Waymo is developing a roomier robotaxi with less-expensive tech (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/19/waymo-generation-6-robotaxi-geely-zeekr.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Waymo's new driverless technology should be able to handle a wider array of weather conditions without requiring as many cameras and sensors. The upcoming Waymo-Zeekr has an accessible interior with a low step, a high ceiling, more leg room, and other features. The car system has a 360 view of obstacles and its sensors have wipers to clear them of most dirt and precipitation. Pictures of the sixth-generation self-driving car are available in the article.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Rocket Lab entered ‚Äúhero mode‚Äù to finish Mars probes‚Äînow it's up to Blue Origin (7 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/rocket-lab-entered-hero-mode-to-finish-mars-probes-now-its-up-to-blue-origin/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Two NASA spacecraft built by Rocket Lab are beginning preparations for launch on Blue Origin's first New Glenn rocket. The two science probes will launch between late September and mid-October. They will take advantage of a planetary alignment between Earth and Mars that only happens once every 26 months to travel to Mars to help scientists learn more about the processes that drive Martian climate change. Assuming the launch is successful, the twin spacecraft will be expected to arrive in orbit around Mars in early September 2025. The next launch window is in late 2026.

[### A Personalized Brain Pacemaker for Parkinson's (12 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/health/parkinsons-brain-pacemaker.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EU4.ixro.yhDrzHJMQgm_&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A recent study exploring an innovative approach to deep brain stimulation found that it cut in half the time patients experienced their most bothersome symptoms. The personalized therapy, called adaptive deep brain stimulation, tailors the amount of electrical stimulation to each patient's individual symptoms. Patients note feeling the difference instantly and most say it helped improve their perceived quality of life. The study was small, but it represents a significant step in creating personalized treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders.

[### Algorithms we develop software by (5 minute read)](https://grantslatton.com/software-pathfinding?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Becoming a better engineer is about becoming a better pathfinder in problem space. Engineers get better at solving problems by writing more code. One way to do this is by rewriting code - rewriting code takes significantly less time than the initial implementation and the results are usually much better. Breaking assumptions can help engineers approach problems differently and result in more efficient solutions.

[### Competing in search (16 minute read)](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/8/19/competing-in-search?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google has the best results because everyone uses it. Being the default search brings in more data, making the search engine even better. It is unclear what companies will do if Google was ordered to stop paying to be the default. Companies like Apple may reinvest the money they were paying Google previously to develop their own search engines. This article takes a look at the many possible impacts the recent antitrust case against Google may have.
