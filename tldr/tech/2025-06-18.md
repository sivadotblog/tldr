[### Musk's xAI Burns Through $1 Billion a Month as Costs Pile Up (5 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-17/musk-s-xai-burning-through-1-billion-a-month-as-costs-pile-up?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MDIwNjEzNSwiZXhwIjoxNzUwODEwOTM1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWFBKUlhUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.RD10FZuAKDEd4Ztpon-nVr0PMFNqGV6H5RnfuXFpyuQ&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

xAI is trying to raise $9.3 billion in debt and equity, with plans to spend more than half of it in just the next three months. The startup is expected to burn through about $13 billion over the course of 2025. Its prolific fundraising efforts are just barely keeping pace with expenses. The losses are due in part to the huge costs that all AI companies face - building server farms and buying the specialized computer chips needed to train advanced AI models.

[### Microbe with bizarrely tiny genome may be evolving into a virus (4 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/article/microbe-bizarrely-tiny-genome-may-be-evolving-virus?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A newly discovered microbe known as Sukunaarchaeum isn't a virus, but it seemingly has just one purpose: to make more of itself. It appears to be a parasite that provides nothing to its hosts. Most of its genes are focused on replicating its own genome and it steals everything it needs from its host. The microbe's bizarre virus-like way of living challenges the boundaries between cellular life and viruses.

Honda recently launched and landed a prototype reusable rocket. The company plans to achieve suborbital space flight by 2029. The 20.6-foot experimental reusable launch vehicle reached an altitude of 889 feet at a test facility in northern Japan. Honda has yet to make a decision regarding the commercialization of its rocket technologies. The launch and landing's success sets an optimistic tone for the company's space program.

[### Double-Entry Ledgers: The Missing Primitive in Modern Software (8 minute read)](https://pgrs.net/2025/06/17/double-entry-ledgers-missing-primitive-in-modern-software/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Double-entry ledger modeling is a better fit for a lot of systems compared to the ad-hoc ledger-ish things they currently use. A double-entry ledger records the current amount or balance of a thing, a historical record of how the amount got to that amount, and where that amount came from at each step. Apps with ledger models built-in can have many things built on top of them without a lot of extra work or complexity. While there is an initial cost to introducing a ledger, that value is recouped over time.

[### Sam Altman says Meta tried and failed to poach OpenAI's talent with $100M offers (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/sam-altman-says-meta-tried-and-failed-to-poach-openais-talent-with-100m-offers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta seems to be on a hiring spree lately to staff up its new superintelligence team. It has reportedly offered employees from OpenAI and Google DeepMind compensation packages worth upwards of $100 million. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that those efforts have largely been unsuccessful. Altman believes that Meta's focus on high compensation rather than a mission of delivering AGI would likely not create a great culture.

[### Amazon CEO says AI agents will soon reduce company's corporate workforce (3 minute read)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-ceo-generative-ai-corporate-workforce/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy issued a memo to employees on Tuesday saying that he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in the next few years as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties. Generative AI and agents are expected to change the way the company does its work. Amazon will need fewer people doing the same jobs done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. The hard pivot into AI has received negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company.
