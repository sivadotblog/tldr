[### Nvidia to make Arm-based PC chips in major new challenge to Intel (3 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-make-arm-based-pc-chips-major-new-challenge-intel-2023-10-23/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia has reportedly started designing Arm-based CPUs for Windows PCs. The chips could be available as soon as 2025. Microsoft has been encouraging chipmakers to build advanced AI features into CPUs as the company believes that AI-enhanced software will become an increasingly important part of using Windows. The project will be challenging and there is no guarantee that Nvidia will be successful.

[### Apple Expected to Announce New iMac Next Week With Faster Processor (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-to-announce-new-imac-october-halloween/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple may be planning a new iMac launch event for the end of this month. The most likely Mac to be announced at the event is a new 24-inch iMac. The current iMac has not been updated for more than 900 days and it is still using the M1 chip. The new iMac might feature the not-yet-announced M3 chip, which will likely be fabricated using TSMC's 3 nm process for significant performance and power efficiency improvements compared to 5 nm-based chips like the M2.

[### Meet Nightshade, the new tool allowing artists to ‚Äòpoison‚Äô AI models with corrupted training data (3 minute read)](https://venturebeat.com/ai/meet-nightshade-the-new-tool-allowing-artists-to-poison-ai-models-with-corrupted-training-data/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new tool called Nightshade alters pixels in images in a way that's invisible to the human eye but poisons the art for any AI models that are trained on it. It causes AI models to learn the wrong names of the objects and scenery they are looking at. The technique is difficult to defend against as it forces AI model developers to remove poisoned images, which by design are difficult to detect. AI models trained on poisoned images will likely need to be retrained.

[### One month after experimental pig heart transplant, doctors say they see no signs of rejection or infection (4 minute read)](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/health/pig-heart-transplant-maryland-update/index.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The patient who received a pig heart in an experimental heart transplant last month appears to have excellent heart function with no signs of infection or rejection. The pig heart had been genetically modified to make it more compatible with humans. Doctors have withdrawn all drugs that were initially supporting the heart, so it is performing well on its own. The patient was the second ever to undergo the treatment - the first patient died from a complex array of factors two months following their transplant.
