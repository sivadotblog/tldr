Google is testing new AI-powered chat products that include a new chatbot and a chatbot search engine integration. The project is being tested by Google's Atlas cloud unit under a 'code red' effort. Google's 'Apprentice Bard' chatbot can provide detailed answers similar to ChatGPT. Its new search design can be used in a question-and-answer form.
