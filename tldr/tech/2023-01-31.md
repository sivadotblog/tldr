[### Uptime, status pages, and transparency calculus (6 minute read)](https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/status-pages/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many large service providers' status pages are constantly evergreen, despite actually having widespread issues and outages. While showing almost constant uptime may be strange, the primary purpose of the number is to convey to customers whether they'll be receiving refunds. There are many incentives against companies providing transparent, prompt communication and accurate uptime reporting. For example, service level agreements often have companies committing to a high level of uptime. If this is breached, customers are entitled to compensation.
