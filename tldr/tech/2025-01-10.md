[### The TikTok Ban Heads to the Supreme Court Tomorrow. Here's What to Know (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-arguments-65506b1f?st=gSvgLz&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

TikTok will argue its case before the Supreme Court today in a case that will decide whether the government can ban the platform if it doesn't sever ties with China. The US government wants to ban TikTok due to concerns about China's control over the app. TikTok says the ban violates its First Amendment right to free speech and that the US government's security concerns are too vague and hypothetical to justify an infringement of its rights. If TikTok is banned on January 19, people who don't already have the app on their devices will no longer be able to download it from Google or Apple app stores. The law also bars US internet hosting services and data-storage providers from supporting the app. There are workarounds, but they are limited.

[### Blue Origin's first orbital launch now targeting Sunday (2 minute read)](https://phys.org/news/2025-01-blue-orbital-sunday.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Blue Origin is aiming to launch its first orbital rocket on Sunday. The launch was delayed due to rough seas in the Atlantic, where the company hopes to land its first stage booster on a ship. The rocket, New Glenn, will carry a prototype of Blue Ring, a US Defense Department funded spacecraft. The launch will mark Blue Origin's long-awaited entry into the orbital launch market and escalate the rivalry between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.

[### My role as a founder CTO: Year Seven (11 minute read)](https://miguelcarranza.es/cto-year-7?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Miguel Carranza, founder of RevenueCat, writes a post every year looking back over the last twelve months. 2024 was a good year for RevenueCat, possibly its best since 2020. While the journey was a lot rockier than Carranza had imagined, it was clear the company succeeded in its goals. The post discusses the company's performance last year, the lessons it learned (on culture, hiring, company building, and scaling as a founder), and its plans for the future.

[### Why aren't we all serverless yet? (12 minute read)](https://varoa.net/2025/01/09/serverless.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The industry pivot to serverless compute hasn't really happened despite an appealing value proposition. Friction against serverless is caused in part by fatigue from the last paradigm shift to microservices. Caution in the industry is reasonable as a shift to serverless will amplify the same type of challenges that were caused by microservices, many of which still aren't fully resolved. The main incentive for broad serverless is financial, not technical, it is unlikely for someone from the engineering department to sponsor the idea.

[### The New $30,000 Side Hustle: Making Job Referrals for Strangers (14 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-09/how-employee-referrals-for-tech-jobs-became-a-side-hustle?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There's a growing underground market connecting job seekers to anonymous company insiders willing to help them get a foot in the door. While a referral is not a guarantee of a job offer, it can substantially improve the odds. There are several sites available that let people get in touch with verified employees of their target employer to discuss job referral opportunities. Many companies say that this is completely fair practice, but others, like Google and Goldman Sachs, disagree.

[### Linux Foundation bands together Chromium browser makers in a ‚Äúneutral space‚Äù (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/google-meta-microsoft-and-opera-agree-on-something-supporting-chromium/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

'Supporters of Chromium-Based Browsers' is an initiative started by the Linux Foundation that will provide funding and development support for industry leaders, academia, developers, and the broader open source community working on open Chromium projects. It will have an open governance model based on transparency, inclusivity, and community-driven development. Google has slowly loosened its control over the Chromium project over the years, allowing outside developers into its leadership, softening its stance on non-Google-derived features, and opening up its 'Goma' development scheme for Chromium.
