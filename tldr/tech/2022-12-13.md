There are several ways ChatGPT can make life easier. The AI can be used to help people lower bills, create diet and workout plans, help with meal planning and grocery shopping, create stories, and prepare for interviews. ChatGPT still isn't perfect, as it isn't able to separate fact from fiction. Its potential for inaccuracy has caused it to be temporarily banned from StackOverflow.

[### A new class of antidepressant works in 2 hours (4 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/health/antidepressant-works-in-2-hours?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have discovered an antidepressant compound that works differently from current drugs and takes effect in as little as two hours. The compound targets the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRS), the brain's primary source of serotonin, decreasing the amount of serotonin in the DRS and increasing it in other regions. When tested on mice, the compound increased serotonin transporter activity and serotonin levels within two hours. The scientists are now pushing for human trials to see if the compound also alleviates depression in humans.

[### A nano-thin layer of gold could prevent fogged-up glasses (2 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/gold-nanocoating-glasses-that-dont-fog-up-160057012.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at ETH Zurich have developed a gold nanocoating that prevents glasses from fogging up. The 10nm thick nanocoating heats glasses up to 46F by absorbing infrared radiation. It consists of gold sandwiched between layers of titanium oxide, which amplifies the heating effect and protects the gold against wear. The design prevents radiation from reaching the other side, so it won't overheat in warm weather. The coating is made using common manufacturing techniques, so companies may not have to revamp their production lines to make it.

[### Chrome delays plan to limit ad blockers, new timeline coming in March (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/chrome-delays-plan-to-limit-ad-blockers-new-timeline-coming-in-march/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google has delayed the mandatory switch to Manifest V3. There won't be a new timeline for a V2 shutdown until March. The delay is due to some challenges developers have had with migrating their extensions. Manifest V3 features more restrictions on filtering extensions that block ads. Some browsers, like Brave and Vivaldi, have pledged to keep Manifest V2 even after Google turns it off. Firefox will transition to Manifest V3 along with Google, but it will re-add the API that filtering add-ons rely on.
