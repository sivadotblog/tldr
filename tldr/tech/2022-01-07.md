[### These Ants Can 'Heal' Wounded Trees in a Fascinating Symbiotic Relationship (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/these-ants-heal-wounded-trees-in-a-fascinating-symbiotic-relationship?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An accidental slingshot hit on a Cecropia tree in Panama led to the discovery that the ants that live inside these trees often fix damage to their living homes. Azteca alfari ants have a well-known mutually beneficial relationship with the trees. The ants use material found within the plant stem to make the repairs. It appears that the ants mostly repair areas where the damage might put the brood at risk, but more research is needed to clarify this.

[### Qubits Can Be as Safe as Bits, Researchers Show (6 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/qubits-can-be-as-safe-as-bits-researchers-show-20220106/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Storing information in qubits is difficult as quantum computers are subject to all sorts of atomic-scale errors. A new preprint posted by researchers from Moscow State University details a theoretical method to protect quantum information from errors just as well as classical information is protected. Quantum computers still have a long way to go before they will become truly useful, but the new method will maintain performance even as the number of qubits scales up. This article discusses the history of the research leading to the development of the new method.
