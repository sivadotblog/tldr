No, it's not Nvidia‚Ä¶ It's Mode Mobile, 2023's fastest-growing software company according to Deloitte.

Just as Uber turned vehicles into income-generating assets, Mode is [turning smartphones into the easiest passive income source](https://invest.modemobile.com/?utm_source=dmrregahome&utm_medium=Partner82-01-nvidia_growth&utm_campaign=Newsletter_ID3650&utm_content=nvidia_growth&tnames=Partner82-01-nvidia_growth), already helping 45M+ users earn $325M+ through simple, everyday use.

The technology behind it all is the EarnPhone, and it could be the biggest disruption to smartphones since the iPhone.

Mode has recently secured their Nasdaq stock ticker $MODE, [but you can still invest in their pre-IPO offering at just $0.26/share](https://invest.modemobile.com/?utm_source=dmrregahome&utm_medium=Partner82-01-nvidia_growth&utm_campaign=Newsletter_ID3650&utm_content=nvidia_growth&tnames=Partner82-01-nvidia_growth). They are over 95% towards their $20M February investment goal, with limited space left in the offering.

Apple's iPhone 16e features an all-new design, an A18 chip, a 48-megapixel camera, full Apple Intelligence support, and the first-ever Apple-designed 5G cellular modem, the C1 chip. It starts at $599 for 128GB and will be available for pre-order tomorrow. The first orders will arrive on February 28. Apple has discontinued the iPhone SE along with the iPhone 14 Plus. The iPhone 14 will remain available from Apple's channel partners but it has been removed from Apple's website.

[### Microsoft deploys new state of matter in its first quantum computing chip (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/19/microsoft-reveals-its-first-quantum-computing-chip-the-majorana-1.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft's first quantum computing chip, Majorana 1, is the result of nearly two decades of research in the field. Microsoft claims that building the chip required the creation of an entirely new state of matter called the topological state. Microsoft manufactured all the parts for the chip in the US, which was possible because of the small scale of the project. Quantum computing may end up being used to boost Microsoft's other businesses rather than just being a stand-alone category.

[### New Book-Sorting Algorithm Almost Reaches Perfection (8 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-book-sorting-algorithm-almost-reaches-perfection-20250124/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have created a new algorithm that addresses the library sorting problem: a challenge to devise a strategy for organizing books in some kind of sorted order that minimizes how long it takes to place a new book on the shelf. The problem applies to the arrangement of files on hard drives and in databases. An inefficient system means significant wait times and major computational expense. The new algorithm is very close to the theoretical ideal.

[### Migraine is more than a headache ‚Äî a radical rethink offers hope to one billion people (10 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00456-x?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Progress in understanding migraines has started to advance beyond focusing on just headaches. Researchers are now developing measures for the cognitive symptoms of migraines. Measuring cognitive symptoms is particularly important to show whether treatments are effective or not. Previous treatment studies focused on headache severity, light sensitivity, and nausea, but little else - cognitive symptoms are commonly felt in between migraine attacks as well. It may require a serious rethink about the causes of migraines in order to make it possible to treat all the complexities of the condition.

Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella says that true AGI should be measured by economic growth rather than AI advancements alone. The real benchmark for AGI's success, according to Nadella, should be global economic growth reaching 10%. The primary beneficiaries of AI advancements will be industries that use AI to drive productivity. The increased productivity will cause the economy to grow at a faster rate.

The odds of an asteroid, designated 2024 YR4, hitting Earth eight years from now continue to increase. Two weeks ago, the odds of the asteroid striking our planet were estimated at 1.9% - the most recent estimate has the likelihood at 3.2%. The asteroid is large enough to cause devastation near its impact site localized to a roughly city-sized area. This article contains an interview with Robin George Andrews, author of the recently published book How to Kill an Asteroid, where Andrews discusses what the impact odds mean and what humanity's plans are in the case of possible impact.
