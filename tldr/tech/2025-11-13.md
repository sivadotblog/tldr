[### OpenAI releases GPT-5.1 to all ChatGPT users (1 minute read)](https://www.testingcatalog.com/openai-releases-gpt-5-1-to-all-chatgpt-users/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has released the GPT-5.1 family of models. GPT-5.1 Instant is a high-volume model that uses adaptive reasoning - it can decide when to think longer on hard prompts. GPT-5.1 Thinking can vary its deliberation for each question, so simple tasks are faster and complex work gets deeper analysis. GPT-5.1 Auto routes queries between models. ChatGPT has gained stronger personalization controls - users can now pick between different personalities.

[### Valve announces three new products: the Steam Frame, Steam Machine, and Steam Controller (6 minute read)](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/valve-announces-steam-machine-frame-controller/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Steam Frame is a new wireless VR headset with pancake optics, a 110-degree field of view, and inside-out tracking. It will not require a gaming PC to work. The Steam Machine is a more powerful but less portable follow-up to the Steam Deck designed to fit into a standard-sized shelving unit to connect to a display. The Steam Controller is designed to replace a mouse. All of the new products will be released in 2026. No prices have been announced yet.

[### Waymo says its self-driving taxis will take customers on freeways for the first time (8 minute read)](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/waymo-says-self-driving-taxis-will-drive-customers-freeways-rcna242426?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Waymo has started offering robotaxi rides on freeways for customers in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. It is the first company to offer fully autonomous freeway rides without a human specialist in the car to fare-paying riders in the US. Freeways are more controlled environments in some respects, but the higher speed poses a much higher risk. Cars need to be able to predict what happens much farther down the road. Waymo has announced plans to more than double the number of cities it operates in.

[### Scientists reveal hidden quantum light states with record 300,000x brightness (6 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/dark-excitons-shine-quantum-control?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Dark excitons are exotic light-matter states found in atomically thin semiconductors. They usually remain invisible because they emit light very weakly. Researchers have found a way to make these previously hidden light states shine brightly and controllably. This discovery opens up a new frontier for faster, smaller, and more energy-efficient technologies.

[### Coinbase to Leave Delaware, Reincorporate in Texas (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/coinbase-to-leave-delaware-reincorporate-in-texas-19e24c5e?st=tEH89F&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Coinbase plans to leave Delaware and reincorporate in Texas because Texas' legal framework is more predictable and efficient. Delaware has long been the legal home of most big companies in the US, but the state's courts appear to be biased against founders and their boards. Texas has capitalized on executives' frustrations with Delaware by establishing the Texas Business Court and passing laws to make it more difficult to sue board members at companies incorporated in Texas and more challenging for shareholders to file stockholder proposals against companies.
