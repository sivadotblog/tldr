Two patients who went through an experimental brain surgery for binge eating disorder reported feeling more in control of their cravings a year after the operation. The operation involved installing a pacemaker-like device under the scalp and wiring the device to an area of the brain that plays a vital role in how people experience reward and satisfaction. The device delivers small electrical zaps to the brain to help stifle cravings. Patients do not feel the zaps, but they may notice changes in their mood.
