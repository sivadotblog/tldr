[### Google launches new AI models and brings ‚Äòthinking' to Gemini (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/google-launches-new-ai-models-and-brings-thinking-to-gemini/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google launched Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental and made Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, its reasoning model, available on the Gemini app on Wednesday. Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental will be available on Google's AI development platforms, Vertex AI and Google AI Studio, and to Gemini Advanced subscribers in the Gemini app. The model excels in coding and handling complex problems and comes with a better understanding and reasoning of world knowledge than previous models. It has a context window of 2 million tokens and can use tools like Google Search and execute code on behalf of users.

[### Amazon Plans to Unveil Next-Generation Alexa AI Later This Month (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/05/alexa-ai-coming-february/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon is revamping Alexa into a generative AI service that will be able to hold complex, context-aware conversations with users and handle multifaceted requests. The company will be AI models from Anthropic's Claude rather than its own in-house technology as early versions of Amazon AI had trouble responding in a timely manner. There are more than 100 million active Alexa users and over 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, so it is important for Amazon to get Alexa AI right. Amazon plans to introduce the new version of Alexa just ahead of when Apple is expected to begin testing its new version of Siri.

[### A flooded quarry, a mysterious millionaire, and the dream of a new Atlantis (14 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/03/flooded-quarry-mysterious-millionaire-and-dream-new-atlantis-welsh-border-deep?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Deep is a project aimed at increasing understanding of the ocean and its critical role for humanity. It is funded by a single anonymous private investor. The project will establish a permanent human presence under the sea where people will be able to stay for up to 28 days at a time. It aims to eventually create permanent human settlements in all oceans across the world. This article looks at the engineering and science required for Deep to be successful.

[### Blue Origin spins up lunar gravity for New Shepard flight (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/05/new_shepard_lunar_gravity/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Blue Origin launched its New Shepard rocket again yesterday to simulate lunar gravity for capsule payloads. The rocket lifted off at 1600 UTC and the capsule reached 105 kilometers above sea level before returning to Earth. The capsule spun for about two minutes during the flight to simulate lunar gravity. New Shepard's ability to provide a lunar gravity environment is unique and valuable for researchers who have their sights set on a return to the Moon. It enables researchers to test lunar technologies at a fraction of the cost, rapidly iterate, and test again in a significantly compressed time frame.

[### Software development topics I've changed my mind on after 10 years in the industry (2 minute read)](https://chriskiehl.com/article/thoughts-after-10-years?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chris Kiehl is a software developer currently working for Amazon. He wrote 'Data Oriented Programming in Java' and created Gooey, a tool that turns almost any Python command-line program into a full GUI application with one line. Four years ago, Kiehl posted a list of software development topics he had changed his mind on after working in the industry. This is an updated take on Kiehl's views - what he's changed his mind on, the opinions he has picked up on the way, and the things he has not changed his opinion on.

[### Ingesting Millions of PDFs and Why Gemini 2.0 Changes Everything (7 minute read)](https://www.sergey.fyi/articles/gemini-flash-2?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Gemini Flash 2.0 achieves near-perfect OCR accuracy while being incredibly cheap. This article looks at how to use the model to parse PDFs. There are still some issues with parsing, chunking, and bounding box detection, but we are almost at the point where document parsing is efficient and practically effortless. The work discussed in the article will eventually be open sourced, but there are likely to be other similar libraries available.

[### Personal Software (4 minute read)](https://leerob.com/n/personal-software?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI has changed our relationship with software - software can now adapt to users. The technology makes it possible for anyone to create single-use or custom applications. Within the next decade, millions of people will be able to create their own software and build their own ideas. More builders will mean more innovation - individuals will have the freedom to solve their own problems.

[### s1: The $6 R1 Competitor? (4 minute read)](https://timkellogg.me/blog/2025/02/03/s1?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

s1 is a recently released model that is making waves in the AI community because it shows how close the industry is to making some very large breakthroughs in AI. The paper released with the model sheds light on how reasoning models work. In s1, when the model tries to stop thinking, is it forced to keep going - this makes it begin to second guess and double check its answer. s1 cost only $6 to train as its creators used a small model and hardly any data. Innovations like s1 that dramatically lower costs allow researchers to learn and understand models faster, which directly translates to a faster pace of AI development.
