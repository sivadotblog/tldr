The tool incorrectly labels human-written text as AI-generated 9% of the time. It requires at least 1,000 characters, or 250 words of text, to run. OpenAI released the tool to get feedback on whether these types of tools are useful and to improve its method.

[### The Spaceport at the Edge of the World (18 minute read)](https://archive.ph/V6vs5?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Melness is a small Scottish town along the desolate northern shoreline. The local development board, in collaboration with the UK government, suggested building a spaceport on the empty peatland behind the town. This would give the UK the opportunity to become the first European country to launch a small satellite.

Construction of the spaceport is set to begin later this year.
