### Big Tech & Startups

[### Elon Musk‚Äôs AI startup ‚Äî X.AI ‚Äî files to raise $1 billion in fresh capital (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/05/elon-musks-ai-startup-xai-files-to-raise-1-billion-.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

X.AI has filed with the SEC to raise up to $1 billion in an equity offering. It has already raised nearly $135 million from four investors and has a binding and enforceable agreement for the purchase of the remaining shares. The startup released an AI chatbot with real-time knowledge of the internet called Grok last month. It aims to directly compete with companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.

[### NASA says SpaceX‚Äôs next Starship flight could test refueling tech (9 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/12/nasa-wants-to-see-gas-stations-in-space-but-so-far-its-tanks-are-empty/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX and NASA may be demonstrating orbital refueling technology on the next Starship test flight. NASA has yet to make a decision on when to start testing the capability. Cryogenic propellants must be kept at super-low temperatures or they turn into a gas and boil off. Rockets using these types of propellants typically need to complete their missions within hours - NASA wants to extend this lifetime to months and enable the transfer of the propellants from one vehicle to another.

[### The first humanoid robot factory is about to open (5 minute read)](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/05/humanoid-robot-factory-agility-bipedal-amazon?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Agility Robotics is building a manufacturing facility in Salem, Oregon, that will eventually pump out 10,000 bi-pedal robots a year. The RoboFab will open early next year. Agility Robotics' Digit is the first commercially available human-shaped robot designed for warehouse work. Deliveries of the robots will start in 2024.

Animate Anyone uses a generative video technique to create videos from pictures of people. While its results are far from perfect, the model is a huge leap over the previous state of the art, which produced way more artifacts or completely lost important details. The team behind the model hasn't released the code for it yet. Videos showing deepfakes made with Animate Anyone are available in the article.

StyleX is an expressive, deterministic, reliable, and scalable styling system. It was carefully designed to meet the requirements of large application, reusable component libraries and statically typed codebases. StyleX is fully typed and supports an expressive subset of CSS. It takes the developer experience of CSS-in-JS libraries and uses compile-time tooling to bridge it with the performance and scalability of static CSS.

Microsoft's CTO Kevin Scott, the person most responsible for forging the OpenAI partnership, believes that AI is one of the most powerful things humans have ever invented. It will take a lot of time to develop the technology, but it could improve the quality of life for everyone.

[### Regretful Accelerationism (21 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2023/regretful-accelerationism/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Internet can not be portrayed as a district development from a world increasingly in turmoil. Removing the constraint of physical distribution may have accelerated the development of many technologies, but it also created many problems. An increasingly AI-generated world where all content is customized for every individual may help more people realize the only way to survive online is to pay it increasingly little heed.
