[### Tesla Model Y refresh planned for Q1 2025, supply chain report claims (4 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2024/08/29/tesla-model-y-refresh-planned-q1-2025-supply-chain-report-claims/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A report from China claiming to use information from Tesla's supply chain states that Tesla is planning a Model Y refresh in the first quarter of 2025. Tesla is also reportedly planning to start production of a 7-seat Model Y at Gigafactory Shanghai soon. It is expected to be an upgraded version of the US seven-seater configuration for the Asian and European markets. Most of the changes made to the Model 3 in last year's refresh will make it to the new Model Y.

[### Apple, Nvidia Are in Talks to Invest in OpenAI (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-apple-funding-chatgpt-50754cd6?st=kw94cmbl59arfq3&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple and Nvidia are in talks to invest in OpenAI as part of a fundraising round that would value OpenAI at above $100 billion. It is an unusual move for Apple, as the company doesn't usually invest in startups. Nvidia has stepped up its investment activity in the past two years, putting its money into AI-related companies. OpenAI is one of the largest users of Nvidia's AI chips.

Decision making in biotech is ridiculously difficult. ML systems can automate low- and medium-level decision making. These systems can generate more data and better synthesize that data into decisions. They are able to systematize human rational frameworks into quantitative, interpretable, and scalable analytic engines. Enabling model-driven decision making would require building an organization in a data centric way with an engineering culture.

The Chinese government's current five-year plan makes comprehensive research facilities for crucial fusion projects a major priority for the country's national science and technology infrastructure. It is estimated to be spending around $1.5 billion each year on fusion, almost double what the US government allocated this year for this research. The country has built itself from being a non-player 25 years ago to having world-class capabilities. Chinese scientists are aiming to build a test reactor with the goal of producing up to 1 gigawatt of fusion power in the 2030s.

The ROI on AI has been positive so far. Scaling laws may eventually collide with economics - if they hold. If scaling laws hold and there are no fundamental technology breakthroughs, then the models trained in 2026/2027 are likely to require clusters that cost well over $100 billion. At that point, the ROI on AI may begin declining.

[### California legislature passes controversial ‚Äúkill switch‚Äù AI safety bill (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/08/as-contentious-california-ai-safety-bill-passes-critics-push-governor-for-veto/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SB-1047 passed the California State Assembly by a 45-11 vote. It now faces just one more procedural state Senate vote before heading to the governor's desk. The bill asks AI model creators to implement a 'kill switch' that can be activated if a model starts introducing novel threats to public safety and security. It has been criticized for focusing on risks from an imagined future AI rather than real present-day harms like deepfakes or misinformation.
