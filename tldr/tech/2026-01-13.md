[### 1X unveils 1XWM world model for NEO robot platform (1 minute read)](https://www.testingcatalog.com/1x-unveils-1xwm-world-model-for-neo-robot-platform/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

1X has integrated its new video-pretrained world model, 1XWM, into its NEO robot platform. The 1XWM model predicts robot actions by generating text-conditioned video rollouts and then translating them into motion commands through an Inverse Dynamics Model. It uses a 14B parameter generative video model as a backbone, with inference currently taking about 11 seconds per rollout. The method enables faster adaptation to new tasks as it doesn't require tens of thousands of robot demonstration hours.
