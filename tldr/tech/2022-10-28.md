Twitter was not a good purchase and nobody thinks the company should be valued at $44 billion. The company doesn't make money and the purchase will hurt Elon Musk's reputation. Musk has plans to increase revenue, but prominent figures have been leaving the platform since the beginning of the pandemic, making his plans more difficult to realize. Twitter has many problems and this may affect Musk's time on his other ventures.
