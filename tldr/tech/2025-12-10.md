[### The Rise of the 0.1x Engineer (1 minute read)](https://www.jerpint.io/blog/2025-12-08-01x-engineer/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Coding assistants allow anyone to become a 10x engineer. However, it is the 0.1x engineers who will soon be the most valuable. These engineers carefully curate code and set the right patterns rather than prompting to add code. It is really easy to add bloat to a code base, but really hard to differentiate dead code from LLM slop leftovers.

[### The Bubble Is Labor (4 minute read)](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-real-bubble-is-human-labor?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Companies only hire people because they can't do all of the work themselves. If every founder could handle all of the tasks themselves, there wouldn't be anywhere near the number of jobs we have today. The only reason the current labor market exists is because there's a group of founders/owners who need help producing their goods and services. These people aren't required to hire anyone, and the moment they can do the work themselves, they will.
