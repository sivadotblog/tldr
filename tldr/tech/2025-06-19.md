Waymo plans to return to New York City next month to do more mapping as well as testing. However, its vehicles will be driven by humans. New York state law doesn't allow for vehicles to operate without a person at the wheel, but Waymo is pushing for changes to the law.

[### The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Fuzzing for Porting Programs (22 minute read)](https://rjp.io/blog/2025-06-17-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-fuzzing?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

One way to port a codebase from C to Rust is to have large language models write fuzz tests and build the port in topological order. This blog post discusses how. While the overall system seems to work, there are some downsides - for example, the resulting Rust code is very 'C-like'. Full automation is difficult, but it may not be completely necessary as humans can still be used to fix issues as they emerge.

[### The Great Decoupling (or Why Your Clicks Are Down and Impressions Up) (4 minute read)](https://ahrefs.com/blog/the-great-decoupling/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google's AI Overviews creates two opportunities for top-ranking content to log impressions for a given keyword: once as a blue link and again as a citation in an AI Overview. Citations seem to be pulled from content that already ranks highly in traditional search results. Clicks are decreasing because AI Overviews are increasing zero-click searches - many searchers are able to resolve their queries now without leaving the search results page. However, it's not all doom and gloom: visits from AI search convert 23 times better than visits from traditional search.
