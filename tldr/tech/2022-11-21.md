[### Silicon Valley layoffs aren‚Äôt just a cost-cutting measure. They‚Äôre a culture reset (9 minute read)](https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/11/17/23463164/silicon-valley-layoffs-tech-boom-over?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Not only are many tech companies slashing jobs, they are also doing away with some of the perks that have become synonymous with working in tech.

This will have all kinds of ramifications in the industry. This article contains excerpts from an interview with Peter Kafka where he discusses how tech culture is changing and the slowing of growth in the industry.
