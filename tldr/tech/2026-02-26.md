[### Datadog research: most cloud workloads are using less than half their allocated resources (Sponsor)](https://www.datadoghq.com/resources/state-of-containers-and-serverless-2025/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=dg-infra-ww-containers-and-serverless-tldr)

Datadog's [2025 State of Containers and Serverless report](https://www.datadoghq.com/resources/state-of-containers-and-serverless-2025/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=dg-infra-ww-containers-and-serverless-tldr) analyzed real usage data from tens of thousands of customers across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

The report covers [10 findings](https://www.datadoghq.com/resources/state-of-containers-and-serverless-2025/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=dg-infra-ww-containers-and-serverless-tldr) on how container and serverless adoption is shifting — including:

1️⃣ Karpenter overtook Cluster Autoscaler for K8s node provisioning, jumping from ~11% to 34% share in two years.

2️⃣ GPU instance hours tripled since late 2023 as teams spin up inference servers like vLLM and Triton for AI workloads.

3️⃣ Arm usage doubled across both Lambda functions (9% → 19%) and cloud instances (9% → 15%).

[### Anthropic's Pentagon Showdown Is About More Than AI Guardrails (16 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-02-26/pentagon-pressures-anthropic-to-drop-ai-guardrails-in-military-standoff?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjA4MTY0NCwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNjg2NDQ0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjFLQ0hLR0lGWVcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIwOThFNzNDQTE5QTA0RDkxODEyQzQ4MjcwRDZERTI0QiJ9.YFL_pJ-l1nLIyOrA6ZITsbywk0POoo_qvZ7oNDve8GM&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthropic has the most constrained use age policy of all of the AI companies working on US military applications. It has a host of limitations on the use of its technology intended to prevent broader societal harm that includes core tenets such as 'Do Not Develop or Design Weapons' and 'Do Not Compromise Computer or Network Systems'. However, there are signs that the company's safety commitments are slipping. The Pentagon's threat to potentially remove Anthropic from the supply chain could be almost fatal to the business.

[### The 10 AM Drop: How Jane Street Broke Bitcoin's Price (13 minute read)](https://x.com/1914ad/status/2026757796390449382?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Beginning in late 2024 and accelerating through 2025, Bitcoin's price experienced sudden and sharp sell-offs every trading day at 10 AM Eastern, coinciding with the US stock market open. The drops were precise, algorithmic, and wildly disproportionate to the broader market conditions. They wiped out leveraged long positions, triggered cascading liquidations, and then reversed within hours. These dumps stopped the moment Jane Street had lawyers looking over its shoulder due to the Terraform Labs lawsuit, and they started again in Q3 2025 when the heat died down.

[### Wayve, an AI Driverless Car Start-Up in Europe, Raises $1.2 Billion (4 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/24/technology/wayve-ai-driverless-car-start-up.html?unlocked_article_code=1.PFA.LAXz.-m9G7WOTvlsb&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Wayve has raised $1.2 billion in a deal that values the London-based autonomous vehicle software startup at $8.6 billion. The funding, which could grow to $1.5 billion if it hits certain performance targets, is one of the largest amounts raised by a European startup. Wayve expects to have its driverless taxis on the road for customers this year through a commercial trial with Uber. Consumer vehicles incorporating its technology will be available to buy by 2027.

[### Alphabet-owned robotics software company Intrinsic joins Google (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/alphabet-owned-robotics-software-company-intrinsic-joins-google/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Alphabet-owned robotics company, Intrinsic, is joining Google to unlock the promise of physical AI for a much broader set of manufacturing businesses and developers. It will remain a distinct entity within Google but work closely with Google DeepMind and tap into Google's Gemini AI models and cloud services. Intrinsic announced a joint venture with Foxconn in October that involves the two companies working together on general-purpose intelligent robots to transform how electronics are manufactured, with the goal of full factory automation. The company is now working towards those goals with closer collaboration with Google's AI prowess.

[### Tests Are The New Moat (4 minute read)](https://saewitz.com/tests-are-the-new-moat?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Software contracts, tests, and API surface area are becoming more valuable as AI becomes better at cloning people's work. This clashes with the incentives of commercialized open source work. Previously, the overhead of writing, understanding, and maintaining the code itself was important. However, clearly defining and communicating open source software's APIs makes it easier for AI to clone work.

[### npm i chat – One codebase, every chat platform (1 minute read)](https://vercel.com/changelog/chat-sdk?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Vercel's new Chat SDK lets teams write bot logic once and deploy to Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Discord, GitHub, and Linear. Its event-driven architecture includes type-safe handlers for mentions, messages, reactions, button clicks, and slash commands. The SDF enables teams to build user interfaces using JSX cards and modals that render natively on each platform. It handles distributed state management using pluggable adapters for Redis, ioredis, and in-memory storage.

[### Software companies buying software: a story of ecosystems and vendors (12 minute read)](https://erikbern.com/2026/02/25/software-companies-buying-software-from-software-companies?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Several things are happening in software: a lot more startups with super-fast revenue growth are popping up, margins are thinner, engineering inequality is growing, and digital natives had a bunch of layoffs. This is all a direct corollary of the platformization of software, and it will continue. What's happening is expected - it just took some time to happen. The software industry is now much bigger than it was a decade ago, and AI is creating a ton of FOMO.

[### Productivity: The Evidence Is Mixed, But the Pattern Is Clear (2 minute read)](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/SEszTmpx7gFaAaHFq/career-decisions-if-you-take-agi-seriously#Productivity__The_Evidence_Is_Mixed__But_the_Pattern_Is_Clear?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI increases productivity on well-scoped tasks where errors are detectable. This breaks down when tasks get harder. When AI agent output is scored algorithmically, it looks moderately capable, but when scored holistically, performance drops substantially. Estimates about AI's effect on productivity drop when task reliability is factored in.
