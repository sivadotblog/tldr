### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### At Last, Single-Photon Cameras Could Peer into Your Brain (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/single-photon-camera?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Superconductor-based cameras have remained confined to the laboratory over the past two decades due to the inability to scale them past a few pixels. A team at the National Institute of Standards and technology (NIST)¬†has created a 0.4-megapixel single-photon camera that could transition superconductor-based cameras from a lab curiosity to an industrial technology. The technology could be used for space imaging, measuring light in photonic quantum computers, and looking into the brain with noninvasive light-based techniques. The team at NIST is now working closely with several bioimaging groups to adapt the device to various applications.

[### Why transformative AI is really, really hard to achieve (21 minute read)](https://zhengdongwang.com/2023/06/27/why-transformative-ai-is-really-really-hard-to-achieve.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While humans have a good track record of innovation, the trend growth rate of GDP per capita has never exceeded three percent per year. There has yet to be a technology that breaks the three percent threshold. Only strong evidence should cause us to expect anything different. AI is likely transformative in the same way that the internet was, but it has many hurdles in the way to the accelerating growth rates predicted by some.

[### AI and the automation of work (13 minute read)](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2023/7/2/working-with-ai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While pretty much everyone in tech agrees that generative AI is a generational change in what we can do with software, there isn't much agreement on anything else about the technology. Every time humans invent a new wave of automation, whole classes of jobs go away, but new ones are created. Over time, the number of total jobs doesn't go down and everyone becomes more prosperous. Right now, we can see which jobs will be going away but we can't predict what the new jobs will be. This article looks at different paradigm-breaking technologies in the past and tries to imagine how AI will change work in the future.
