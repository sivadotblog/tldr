[### Instagram may launch separate Reels app to take on TikTok (1 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgwwd09vwzo?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Instagram is reportedly considering launching a separate Reels app focused on short-form video. TikTok's future remains uncertain in the US. President Trump has granted an extension to comply with the law that requires a sale or ban of the platform and floated the possibility of a joint venture between the US and ByteDance, but there are few details on how that might work. The law was enacted due to arguments that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.

The research version of Boston Dynamics' Spot quadruped robot comes with a low-level application programming interface that allows direct control of Spot's joints - it also unlocks some significant performance improvements, including a much faster running speed. The Robotics and AI Institute has been applying reality-grounded reinforcement learning techniques to enable much higher performance from Spot. This article looks at the improvements these techniques have made and also a brand-new hardware platform - an autonomous bicycle that can jump.

Athena is also carrying three robotic rovers and a small flying 'hopper'. More details about Athena's payloads are available in the article.

[### Nvidia's AI Boom Brings Riches to Partners Like Dell, at a Cost (6 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/nvidia-s-ai-boom-spurs-sales-to-partners-like-dell-and-hpe-but-at-a-cost?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MDYzNTUwMywiZXhwIjoxNzQxMjQwMzAzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUTVJTEZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.F_NKEaXzN5aQowTzJPiaJoKlnuXGg1BhAaLirk4Tiyo&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Dell's $5 billion deal to supply servers to xAI is an immense win for the computer seller, but the deal only has a narrow margin of profitability. People familiar with the deal say that the deal is expected to yield gross margins only in the mid-single-digits percentage. Nvidia has expanded its product range, reducing opportunities for companies like Dell to bundle higher-margin items. The company's massive leverage is likely to continue at least until rival chipmakers launch competing products.
