[### Tesla Cybertruck sales are disastrous (3 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2025/01/02/tesla-cybertruck-sales-are-disastrous/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cybertruck sales are stalling a year into production. While Tesla claimed to have over 1 million reservations for the vehicle, it had lowered its reservation deposit to just $100 and the production version of the truck was more expensive and had less range than what Tesla originally announced. The company delivered around 40,000 Cybertrucks before opening orders beyond the reservation program. It's estimated that Tesla delivered between 9,000 and 12,000 Cybertrucks in Q4.

OpenAI launched ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. Within two months, its site was being visited by more than 100 million visitors. The startup hasn't been the same since. This article contains an interview with OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman. Altman explains his infamous four-day firing, how he runs OpenAI, his plans for the Trump-Musk presidency, and his relentless pursuit of artificial general intelligence.

[### This Year, RISC-V Laptops Really Arrive (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/risc-v-laptops?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Framework plans to release a laptop that can support a RISC-V mainboard in 2025. RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (a set of valid instructions programs can execute on a processor) that provides a viable alternative to x86 and Arm. It is open source, making it easy to customize hardware. While current RISC-V chips perform well behind x86 and Arm-powered alternatives, performance will be much better in the coming year.

[### SpaceX announces slate of upgrades for its next Starship launch (3 minute read)](https://www.chron.com/culture/article/spacex-starship-launch-7-20013963.php?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX has made special improvements for its seventh Starship test flight, which may be on January 10. The test will attempt Starship's first payload deployment test, multiple reentry experiments geared towards ship catch and reuse, and the launch and return of the Super Heavy booster. The booster will splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico if the catching systems aren't healthy during the launch. The booster will slow down from supersonic speeds upon return, which will result in sonic booms around the catch area.

Malware on PyPI is a persistent problem. PyPI recently added the ability to quarantine projects. Administrators are able to mark projects as potentially harmful, which prevents it from being easily installed by users. This post discusses how the feature was implemented and upcoming improvements.

[### Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to ‚Äúwrite better code‚Äù? (22 minute read)](https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There was a trend a while ago where people kept asking AI image generators to make something 'more X', which interestingly resulted in the images eventually becoming something cosmic. This article looks at whether this concept could apply to large language model-generated code - whether asking an LLM to 'make code better' can result in improvements. It appears that asking an LLM to 'write code better' results in better code compared to direct prompting (at least with Claude 3.5 Sonnet). LLMs can produce interesting ideas and tool suggestions even if the output can't be used as is.

[### Exploring a stablecoin bank (8 minute read)](https://x.com/bridge__harris/status/1875245405673238796?s=12&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A stablecoin network could drop payment fees to essentially zero. Merchants attempting to avoid credit card processing fees is not a new concept, but the problem is in getting customers to switch their payment methods. It is possible to shift customer behavior under the right conditions. The potential market for cheaper, faster, and more efficient payment methods is clearly strong - this article discusses how a brand-new stablecoin bank could be used to align incentives to get everyone on board.

[### Inside the wild fall and last-minute revival of Bench, the VC-backed accounting startup that imploded over the holidays (8 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/03/inside-the-wild-fall-and-last-minute-revival-of-bench-the-vc-backed-accounting-startup-that-imploded-over-the-holidays/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Bench, an accounting and tax startup based in Canada, suddenly shut down on December 27 after 13 years of operation. The company's hundreds of staff were laid off immediately without any severance or notice. Some of its staff claim that the company's struggles were due to a push to embrace AI and other automation tools in recent years. Overreliance on automation tools, sometimes at the expense of human workers, caused delays, which made some customers leave. Bench was saved by an unlikely acquistion by Employer.com, who extended a large number of job offers to former Bench staff.
