OpenAI will pay Amazon $38 billion for computing power in a multiyear deal. Amazon expects all of the computing capacity negotiated as part of the agreement to be available by the end of the year. It wasn't able to sell its cloud services to OpenAI for years because OpenAI had an exclusive cloud-computing partnership with Microsoft. OpenAI is set to generate $13 billion in revenue this year. It will have to continue expanding sales at an exponential rate to pay for its computing needs. Sam Altman claims that OpenAI is facing severe computing shortages and that revenue will grow even faster as more capacity becomes available.

[### Alphabet is increasingly launching ‘moonshot' projects as independent companies — here's why (6 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/alphabet-is-increasingly-launching-moonshot-projects-as-independent-companies-heres-why/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Alphabet's X Moonshot factory is increasingly spinning out its ambitious technology projects to market as independent companies rather than keeping them within the Alphabet corporate structure, because while some moonshots benefit from Alphabet's resources and scale, others can go faster and won't really benefit from being part of the company because they're too different. It uses a dedicated venture fund called Series X Capital to invest in its spinouts. The moonshot factory has a culture that celebrates killing off promising ideas. It actively looks for reasons to shut down its projects, resulting in a brutal 2% hit rate - this makes it necessary to have a fund that deeply understands its goals.

Vast's Haven Demo mission launched into orbit on Sunday on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

The Haven Demo will be followed by a single-module human-rated habitat called Haven-1, and then a multi-module space station complex named Haven-2.

[### The fetch()ening (14 minute read)](https://htmx.org/essays/the-fetchening/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

htmx 4.0 contains three major simplifying changes: fetch() will replace XMLHttpRequest as the core ajax infrastructure, attribute inheritance will be explicit rather than implicit, and history support will no longer snapshot to the DOM and keep it locally. Most things will stay the same - except for adding an :inherited modifier on a few attributes, most htmx projects will be compatible with htmx 4.0. htmx 2.0 will remain supported in perpetuity.

[### The Great Decoupling of Labor and Capital (12 minute read)](https://www.mbi-deepdives.com/the-great-decoupling-of-labor-and-capital/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Today's megacap tech companies' growth is pretty much decoupled from their headcount. This was evident even before Generative AI arrived on the scene. AI taking over people's jobs might be a gradual thing rather than a moment in time. Even if we don't reach 'AGI', the actual difference of reaching it or not may prove to be minimal in a couple of decades.

[### The Startup Winter Is Always Coming (5 minute read)](https://brajeshwar.com/2025/the-startup-winter-is-always-coming/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Market cycles keep repeating. Founders who internalize this pattern are never surprised and can adapt to changing conditions. A startup is a long trek through changing climates. Founders who ignore cycles risk being caught off guard, but those who obsess over cycles risk paralysis. The balance is to expect the inevitable and prepare for it without being fearful of it.
