[### Apple Vision Pro May Now Be Out of Production (3 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/31/vision-pro-may-be-out-of-production/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple may have ceased production of its first-generation Vision Pro headset. Scaling back of production began in the early summer. It is not unusual for Apple to do this with low-demand products. Suppliers have produced the enough components for between 500,000 to 600,000 headsets. Apple is apparently able to resume production if sales pick up as the production lines haven't been dismantled yet.

Artificial neural networks are being used to decipher ancient texts. The technology is producing more data for scholars than they've had for centuries. It is making sense of vast archives, filling in missing and unreadable characters, and decoding rare and lost languages. The technology promises a fundamentally new way to explore ancient sources.

[### Bring the real world to Unreal Engine (Website)](https://cesium.com/platform/cesium-for-unreal/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cesium for Unreal unlocks a 3D geospatial ecosystem for game engines. It allows users to create digital worlds from real-world 3D content. The free plugin provides a full-scale, high-accuracy WGS84 globe for Unreal Engine. It can visualize massive high-resolution real-world photogrammetry and 3D content at runtime using 3D Tiles. Cesium is integrated with UE features to enable a high degree of interactivity, physical realism, and photorealism.

[### 2024 in AI predictions (14 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CJ4sppkGcbnGMSG2r/2024-in-ai-predictions?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article contains a list of predictions made in 2024 by prominent people in the AI industry about AI development over the next couple of decades. It also reviews some of the predictions made about 2024. Elon Musk thinks that AI will probably be smarter than any single human by the end of this year. However, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun have both said that it will take much longer, possibly even two decades.

[### H5N1: Much More Than You Wanted To Know (24 minute read)](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/h5n1-much-more-than-you-wanted-to?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

All pandemic flus started as bird flus - influenza A evolved in birds but it sometimes spreads to other animals, including pigs, cattle, and humans. The most common way for a bird flu to spread to humans is to 'reassort' with a human flu virus, which results in a virus with all of the human flu virus' human adaptations, but with enough new antigens from the bird virus to evade the immune system. Pigs can be infected by both human and bird viruses, so they are a common place for this reassortment to take place. Humans can catch animal diseases without the disease having 'crossed over' to humans, but every viral replication that takes place in a human who has both a bird and a normal human flu gives the virus an extra chance to reassort in a way that produces a bird-antigen-fortified human-adapted flu virus.
