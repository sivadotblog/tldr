[### Elon Musk Makes Big Investment in Generative-AI Project at Twitter (7 minute read)](https://archive.ph/tA46W#selection-1861.0-1877.214?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk is reportedly moving forward with an artificial intelligence project within Twitter. He recently purchased around 10,000 graphics processing units for the platform. Musk has also hired two former engineers from DeepMind for the project. The project involves a large language model, but it is still at an early stage. Musk recently signed an open letter calling for an industry-wide halt on AI development.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Open source is fueling the future of nuclear physics (10 minute read)](https://github.com/readme/featured/nuclear-fusion-open-source?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Open source software played a key role in last year's nuclear fusion breakthrough at the National Ignition Facility, where they succeeded in creating a controlled nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it took to cause. Other scientific fields, especially those that require the use of supercomputers, are also benefiting from open source software. It took some time before the nuclear industry started releasing open source software, due to the potential dangers of the technology, but the secrecy made research and education unnecessarily difficult. The openness is now allowing the industry to move forward faster.

[### Surprising things happen when you put 25 AI agents together in an RPG town (8 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/surprising-things-happen-when-you-put-25-ai-agents-together-in-an-rpg-town/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A group of researchers from Stanford University and Google have created a virtual world where 25 characters controlled by ChatGPT and custom code live out their lives. The agents wake up, eat, go to work, partake in hobbies, form opinions, interact with each other, and remember and reflect on their days. This article looks at what happened during the experiment. Three emergent behaviors appeared during the experiment: agents told each other information and the information spread socially among the town, agents remembered past interactions and mentioned them later, and agents started coordinating with each other to plan and attend events.
