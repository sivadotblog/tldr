The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is set to launch in the US early next year. Its inner display measures 10 inches across. The phone's specs are overall pretty similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 7, though the battery is quite a bit bigger at 5,600 mAh. The device will come only in 'Crafted Black'. It only measures 3.9mm at its thinnest unfolded point. When folded up, the device measures 12.9mm thick, which is markedly thinner than the Galaxy Z Fold 5, which was only released two years ago.

Neuralink is considering an upgrade for its first human patient. Since receiving the implant, the patient has been able to play games, attend classes, and work. He is currently studying neuroscience and maintaining good grades, something that would be impossible without Neuralink. An upgrade would allow him to perform even more sophisticated tasks using only his mind.

[### Punycode: My New Favorite Algorithm (45 minute read)](https://www.iankduncan.com/engineering/2025-12-01-punycode?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Punycode is a special encoding used to convert Unicode characters to ASCII. It's deceptively simple on the surface, but there's real sophistication in how it manages the problems inherent in encoding arbitrary Unicode within DNS' ASCII-only infrastructure. The algorithm uses adaptive bias adjustment, variable-length encoding, and delta compression to achieve extremely dense results. This article looks at how to encode arbitrary Unicode within DNS's ASCII-only infrastructure. It provides a step-through visualizer at the end that lets readers watch the algorithm encode domains from various scripts.

[### Treat test code like production code (4 minute read)](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2025/12/01/treat-test-code-like-production-code/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The same coding standards applied to production code should also be applied to test code. Test code needs to be readable, well-factored, and reviewed, just like production code. Good code makes it easier for people working on the code to read, understand, and update. Applying coding standards and design principles to test code makes maintainability easier.

Instagram employees will be required to return to the office beginning February 2. Employees will still be able to work remotely when needed, but they have been asked to use their best judgment on when to take advantage of that flexibility. Other planned changes intended to make Instagram more nimble and creative next year include the scaling back of recurring meetings and a faster process for unblocking and decision-making. While executives insist that in-person work has important benefits, employees often disagree.
