[### The Man Tasked With Rebooting Amazon AI (8 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/rohit-prasad-amazon-alexa-ai-85e3ed71?st=eoqupa&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Rohit Prasad, one of the chief architects of Amazon's Alexa, is leading the company's effort to catch up in the AI race. Prasad is leading a new team of thousands of people to develop AI products for an Alexa upgrade and other businesses. Amazon is expected to unveil a new Alexa with AI as early as next month, but company insiders say Amazon's proprietary models are still behind those of its biggest competitors. Amazon prefers to develop its own technology to have full control over its products and services, but it has increasingly leaned on partnerships as the AI race has progressed.

[### How Sonos Botched an App and Infuriated Its Customers (7 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-23/how-sonos-botched-an-app-and-infuriated-its-customers?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNzEzNzgzMiwiZXhwIjoxNzI3NzQyNjMyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSzlKWVJEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.iR-CysWIxrmUB5-l_3ynsh2KIFsMyqWumT9zF5uyb6A&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sonos' app launch in May was one of the most disastrous software releases by any consumer technology company ever. The app was released with plenty of bugs and missing core functionality. Sonos predicts that it will fall $200 million short of its annual revenue target. It has postponed two new products until the problems are fixed, which is still expected to take months. The issues were caused by the company ignoring tech debt, disregarding employee warnings, and cutting costs.

It is expected to be issued in late November.

People have become dramatically more capable over time - this trend is not new, but it will soon be accelerated.

[### Founder mode vs Bureaucrat mode (6 minute read)](https://x.com/andrewchen/status/1838329107631018004?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Bureaucrat mode is what happens when companies get big, scaled, and successful. People purposely implement best practices with good intentions, but these processes can make it hard to get anything done. Startups have a huge advantage over large companies in that they can move incredibly fast and just focus on output. As startups start to gain success and get bigger, they start to get bogged down with bureaucracy. This allows for newer, more nimble startups to emerge - then the cycle continues.
