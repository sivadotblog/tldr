[### Apple's Noninvasive Blood Glucose Technology for Future Apple Watch Reaches 'Proof-of Concept' Stage (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/22/apple-blood-glucose-monitoring-technology/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is making progress on a noninvasive blood glucose monitoring technology for the Apple Watch. The technology uses a silicon photonics chip and laser light to measure glucose levels under the skin. The current prototype is the size of an iPhone and attaches to a person's arm. Apple has hundreds of engineers working on the project, but it is still years away from completion. The company wants its technology to be able to detect pre-diabetes and allow people to make lifestyle changes before full-blown diabetes develops.

[### Tesla announces new engineering headquarters in California (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/22/23610766/tesla-california-engineering-headquarters-elon-musk?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla has announced that it will take over office space formerly occupied by Hewlett Packard and open a new engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, California. The company moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas, in October 2021 in recognition of its new Gigafactory in the state. Despite CEO Elon Musk's previous threats to leave California due to disagreement with COVID-19 safety protocols, Tesla has continued to invest in its Fremont factory and maintains its old headquarters in Palo Alto. Musk relocated to Texas in late 2020 as SpaceX increased its presence there.

[### Google claims breakthrough in quantum computer error correction (3 minute read)](https://archive.ph/RpoxT?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google has achieved a breakthrough in correcting errors in quantum computers. Currently, quantum computers struggle to produce results due to their qubits only holding their quantum states for a short time. Information is lost before the machine can complete its calculations. Correcting these errors is the hardest technical challenge the industry faces. Google's researchers recorded a 4% reduction in error rates when scaling up their technique. The research puts Google on the path to its first practical quantum computer. There is a chance that the error-correction technique may not work when applied to larger quantum systems.

[### Relativity Space's first launch of 3D-printed Terran rocket scheduled for March (2 minute read)](https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2023/02/22/relativity-spaces-first-launch-of-3d-printed-terran-rocket-scheduled/69933658007/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Relativity Space is targeting March 8th for the first flight of its 3D-printed Terran 1 rocket. The mission, dubbed 'Good Luck, Have Fun', will mark the company's first launch and will lift off at 1 PM EST from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It won't be carrying any customer payloads. The rocket will be the largest 3D printed object to attempt an orbital mission. 85% of the rocket's mass is 3D printed. Relativity aims to increase this to 95% for future rockets.

This article looks at the implications of using AI in the legal sector and how it is being used in the industry. The potential of AI to disrupt the legal industry is growing as generative AI tools become more advanced. Generative AI is a good fit for the legal industry, which relies heavily on standardized documents and precedents. The technology's tendency to 'hallucinate' or make things up could be costly in a legal context.

[### The Radical Promise of Nuclear Fusion (15 minute read)](https://every.to/p/the-radical-promise-of-nuclear-fusion?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory recently achieved a major milestone, inducing a fusion reaction that released 3.15 megajoules of energy using a beam of 2.05 megajoules of ultraviolet light. Now, the challenge for the scientific community is to scale this process to an industrial level. This article looks at the history of fusion technology, explaining the main concepts, bottlenecks, and opportunities of making fusion power a reality. Achieving feasible fusion power is a massive design problem that requires further research, but if successful could provide clean and sustainable energy on earth.
