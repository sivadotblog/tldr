[### Samsung launches thin S25 Edge as Apple reportedly prepares the iPhone ‚ÄòAir' (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch-specs-price-availability.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Samsung has unveiled a thin version of its flagship smartphone called the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. The device is 5.8 millimeters thin and weighs 163 grams. It will go on sale on May 30, starting at $1,099. Samsung may be trying to get ahead of Apple, which is gearing up to launch the iPhone 17 Air.

[### Why Moderna Merged Its Tech and HR Departments (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-moderna-merged-its-tech-and-hr-departments-95318c2a?st=WaRJYm&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Moderna's merging of technology and human resources into a single function is a sign of how artificial intelligence will change the workforce. The company is redesigning teams based on what work is best done by people versus what can be automated with technology. It has developed over 3,000 tailored GPTs designed for specific tasks like dose selection for clinical trials and drafting responses to questions from regulators. As a result, roles are being created, eliminated, and reimagined.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### A new era in cancer therapies is at hand (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/a-new-era-in-cancer-therapies-is-at-hand/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

CAR-T cells are modified cells used in a form of immunotherapy that involves changing parts of the immune system into cancer-attacking instruments. It is one of the most promising modern cancer treatments. While some studies have linked the therapy to fatal complications, new therapies are beginning to surpass those challenges and provide safer, more targeted delivery directly to tumors. Improving on these strategies might lead to treatments for even the most resistant types of cancer.

[### New Mexico's Spaceport America looks up and into the future (7 minute read)](https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/new-mexicos-spaceport-america-looks-up-and-into-the-future?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Spaceport America, a purpose-built commercial spaceport with 6,000 square miles of restricted airspace, has plans to further grow its launch complex. The company is currently expanding access roads and plans to build a hanger that acts as a security center, STEM education center, office and conference area, and center for handling small vehicle and payload processing. Spaceport America is currently working on a reentry license so it can do capsule return and other types of returns. Being an inland spaceport, it will never have the throughput that the Cape in Florida has, but it is a good alternative for quick small to medium-sized launches.

### Programming, Design & Data Science

[### Hyper-Typing (6 minute read)](https://pscanf.com/s/341/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Hyper-typing, the act of making typings so complex that it makes them almost unusable, is becoming a trend in the TypeScript ecosystem. While there are very good reasons for using types, hyper-typing is a slippery slope that ends in a place where things work, and they might also look good for the caller, but the resulting types are a complex mess and the compilation errors produced are walls of inscrutable text. Less accurate and less safe libraries might be dumber, but working with them is overall more enjoyable, and the resulting code is more understandable and maintainable.

[### StarGuard (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/m-ahmed-elbeskeri/Starguard?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Fake stars are rampant and supply chain attacks are rising. StarGuard is a command-line tool for detecting fake-star campaigns, dependency hijacks, license red flags, and other signals of open-source risk. It was designed to automate open-source due diligence so it can be done in seconds. StarGuard only uses public metadata (unless a token is provided) and it doesn't execute any code.

The Federal Railroad Administration is in discussions with the Boring Company to see whether it can help with a multi-billion-dollar Amtrak project. The firm told officials that it could find ways to build the tunnels needed for the project more cheaply and efficiently. The Boring Company is one of several firms being consulted for the project. No decision has been made on bids yet.

[### Apple Considers Raising iPhone Prices, Without Blaming Tariffs (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-price-increase-2eaebb14?st=4X7295&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is considering price increases for its fall iPhone lineup. It is determined to avoid any scenario in which it appears the price increases are attributed to US tariffs on goods from China. The US and China agreed yesterday to suspend most of the tariffs they had imposed on each other. Chinese factories will continue to handle the bulk of production for Apple's most profitable and high-end phones. While Indian factories are capable of producing Pro models, the country's infrastructure and technical capabilities are not yet able to support mass production at the same scale as China.
