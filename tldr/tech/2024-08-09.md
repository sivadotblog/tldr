[### Are synthetic wombs the future of childbirth? New Chinese experiment sparks debate (7 minute read)](https://kr-asia.com/are-synthetic-wombs-the-future-of-childbirth-new-chinese-experiment-sparks-debate?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese researchers recently announced a groundbreaking synthetic womb experiment without the use of extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO allows for oxygenation of fetus blood after removal from the mother's body, bypassing the heart and lungs, allowing these organs to rest and heal. It is expensive and comes with risks such as blood clots and infections. An ECMO-free artificial womb would significantly lower costs - the operating costs of ECMO are around $9,000 a day.

[### Is It Time To Version Observability? (Signs Point To Yes) (17 minute read)](https://charity.wtf/2024/08/07/is-it-time-to-version-observability-signs-point-to-yes/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The observability industry has stuck to metrics, logs, and traces over the years because they describe the daily reality for engineers. While the language used to describe the problems and solutions has evolved, the solutions are still largely the same as they were a decade ago. While they have massively improved, they're structurally variations on the same pre-aggregated metrics. It's now getting harder and harder to speak clearly about different approaches and solutions - a problem semantic versioning was made to solve.
