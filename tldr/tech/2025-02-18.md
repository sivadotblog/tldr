Along with the new camera layout, it's been reported that the iPhone 17 Pro will return to having curved sides. It is unclear how reliable or accurate the rumors are, but the leaker has been accurate about camera details before.

[### First 1.5-mile stretch of Saudi's audacious Line megacity begins to rise (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/architecture/line-construction-update-first-phase-feb/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Construction has begun on the first phase of the Line, Saudi Arabia's planned 170-kilometer-long megacity in the desert. The first phase, which will stretch 2.5 kilometers, will be named Hidden Marina. It will be made up of three individual modular segments measuring 21 million square meters. Hidden Marina will host an initial population of around 200,000 residents. It will have 80,000 residential units, 9,000 hotel rooms, commercial and retail spaces, fire stations, schools, police and security services, and other amenities. Residents will have access to all daily essentials within a five-minute walk and high-speed rail will provide transit around the metropolis.

[### Researchers are training AI to interpret animal emotions (1 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/16/researchers-are-training-ai-to-interpret-animal-emotions/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Several teams around the world are working on AI systems to help humans understand animals. A group at the University of the West of England Bristol and Scotland's Rural College have developed a system called Intellipig that examines photos of pigs' faces and notifies farmers if there are signs of pain, sickness, or emotional distress, and a team at the University of Haifa is training AI to identify signs of discomfort in dogs' faces. These systems still rely on humans to do the initial work of identifying the meanings of different behaviors.

[### My Time at MIT (2 minute read)](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/02/my-time-at-mit.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

[### I was given early access to Grok 3 earlier today, making me I think one of the first few who could run a quick vibe check (6 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1891720635363254772.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Grok 3 has an around state-of-the-art thinking model that is able to solve some advanced questions. It is likely somewhere around o1-pro in terms of capability and ahead of DeepSeek-R1. DeepSearch can produce high quality responses to various research- or lookup-type questions, but it can still hallucinate information - even URLs. Overall, Grok 3 + Thinking feels somewhere around the state-of-the-art territory of OpenAI's strongest models, and slightly better than DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.
