SpaceX will sell insider shares at $112 each in a tender offer that values the company at close to $210 billion. The company was valued at $180 billion in December. The new valuation is a record for an American private company. It puts SpaceX on par with some of the world's largest publicly traded companies by market capitalization. Terms on the tender offer haven't been finalized - the size of the offer could change depending on interest from both insider sellers and buyers.

[### German firm Synhelion opens ‚Äòworld's 1st' industrial solar fuel plant (4 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/energy/synhelion-dawn-solar-fuel-plant?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

DAWN is a project from Synhelion that aims to remove the dependency on fossil fuels from the transport sector, particularly in aviation. It uses a 65-foot-high solar tower surrounded by a mirror field that concentrates solar rays to produce synthetic fuels using solar heat. The tower has an energy storage system that allows it to generate solar fuel even when there's no sunlight. DAWN is scheduled to begin production in the latter half of the year. Synhelion says DAWN will produce several thousand liters of fuel per year.

Astronomers have found a galaxy that was already shining with intense starlight when the universe was only 290 million years old. The earliest, most distant galaxy yet found, JADES-GS-z14-0 is one of a string of discoveries enabled by the James Webb Space Telescope that challenge conventional models of how the first stars and galaxies formed. The discovery proves that luminous galaxies were already in place 300 million years after the Big Bang and are more common than what was expected. Galaxy formation models will need to address the existence of such large and luminous galaxies so early in cosmic history.

[### Learning from popup villages (9 minute read)](https://words.jonhillis.com/popup-villages/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Some popup villages have seen hundreds of people from the internet gather for multiple months at a time. These gatherings are long enough to build relationships but short enough to not require permanent relocation. People can join these communities for however long they want, creating an opportunity for a demand-first approach to prototyping permanent places. This essay looks at successful popup villages, why they work, and where they could go next.

[### OpenAI's new ‚ÄúCriticGPT‚Äù model is trained to criticize GPT-4 outputs (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/openais-criticgpt-outperforms-humans-in-catching-ai-generated-code-bugs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

CriticGPT is a new AI model from OpenAI designed to identify mistakes in code generated by ChatGPT. Based on the GPT-4 family of large language models, it analyzes code and points out potential errors, making it easier for humans to spot mistakes that might otherwise go unnoticed. CriticGPT was trained on a large number of inputs containing deliberately inserted mistakes. Its capabilities extend beyond just code review - it is able to identify errors made by ChatGPT in some other tasks as well. OpenAI plans to integrate CriticGPT-like models into its RLHF labeling pipeline to provide its trainers with AI assistance.
