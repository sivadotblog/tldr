[### Video: Boom's XB-1 cleared for supersonic test flights (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/boom-supersonic-xb-1-test-flights-exceed-mach/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US FAA has given Boom the first-ever Special Flight Authorization to Exceed Mach. The authorization will allow the company's XB-1 prototype to break the sound barrier during its test flights. The permission designated the Black Mountain Supersonic Corridor at Edwards Air Force Base in California and part of the High Altitude Supersonic Corridor within the R-2515 airspace as a permissible area for Boom to conduct supersonic test flights. Boom still has to complete up to 20 subsonic tests before starting supersonic tests.

[### Two lifeforms merge in once-in-a-billion-years evolutionary event (5 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/biology/life-merger-evolution-symbiosis-organelle/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have witnessed a rare phenomenon called primary endosymbiosis, where one microbial organism engulfs another and starts using it like an internal organ. The process results in the host cell providing nutrients, energy, protection, and other benefits to the symbiote, which eventually becomes an organelle. It is being observed in a species of algae which have engulfed a cyanobacterium, allowing the algae to obtain nitrogen straight from the air. The relationship between the two organisms started to evolve around 100 million years ago. Studying the process may provide a new path to incorporate nitrogen-fixing into plants to grow better crops.

[### Hatchet (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Hatchet is a distributed fault-tolerant task queue. It replaces difficult-to-manage legacy queues and pub/sub systems so that developers can design durable workloads that recover from failure and solve for problems like concurrency, fairness, and rate limiting. Hatchet can be used to distribute functions between sets of workers with minimal configuration or infrastructure. Example use cases for Hatchet include fairness for generative AI, batch processing for document indexing, workflow orchestration for multi-modal systems, and correctness for event-based processing.

[### Chemists Invent Drugs and Drugs Save Lives (23 minute read)](https://bit.ly/3W5TSK9)

Drug development is an integrated team effort with crucial players from both the biology and chemistry disciplines. However, the design, synthesis, purification, and characterization of new drugs lies squarely within the domain of chemistry. Physicians administer drugs, but they don't usually invent them. The public needs to be more aware of chemists' involvement with the drug development process so that they can better help resolve the myriad of problems confronting humankind.

[### China Orders Apple to Remove Popular Messaging Apps (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-removes-whatsapp-threads-from-china-app-store-on-government-orders-a0c02100?st=im8043f5z8deoro&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China has ordered Apple to remove some of the world's most popular messaging apps from the App Store in the country. WhatsApp, Threads, Signal, Telegram, and Line have now been removed from the store. Apple said it was told to remove the apps due to national security concerns. The messaging apps were only accessible in China through virtual private networks, but they were still commonly used.
