The discussions are still ongoing and the terms could change. The financing will support the need for computing power and other operating expenses. OpenAI is aiming to allow employees to sell some of their shares in a tender offer later this year.

[### Proposed underwater data center surprises regulators who hadn't heard about it (9 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/proposed-underwater-data-center-surprises-regulators-who-hadnt-heard-about-it/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NetworkOcean launched out of Y Combinator on August 15 by announcing plans to dunk a small capsule filled with GPU servers into the San Francisco Bay. The founders say that moving data centers off land would slow ocean temperature rise by drawing less power and letting seawater cool the capsules' shells. Scientists say that the slightest heat or disturbance from the submersibles could trigger toxic algae blooms and harm wildlife. The startup has been pursuing its initial test without seeking any permits from key regulators. It intends to test its submersible for about an hour in an area it says is privately owned and not subject to regulatory oversight.

[### Oracle is designing a data center that would be powered by three small nuclear reactors (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/oracle-is-designing-a-data-center-that-would-be-powered-by-three-small-nuclear-reactors.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Oracle is designing a data center that will require more than a gigawatt of power. It will be powered by three small modular nuclear reactors. Oracle has already received building permits for the reactors but hasn't publicly disclosed the location of the data center or future reactors. There are currently three operational small modular reactors in the world, with experts in the industry generally agreeing that the technology won't be commercialized in the US until the 2030s.

[### The Modern CLI Renaissance (14 minute read)](https://gabevenberg.com/posts/cli-renaissance/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The rate at which new CLI tools are being written has picked up over the past few years after seeing relatively little activity between 1995 and 2015. This article discusses the trend where people are rewriting and rethinking staples of the command line interface, why the trend may be happening, and why the trend is a good thing. New tools have the opportunity to learn from their predecessors and build upon them. While the new tools may not be perfect, they are a result of software becoming more polished and adapted to new use cases.

[### The Palace Coup at the Magic Kingdom (73 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/business/media/disney-bob-iger-chapek.html?unlocked_article_code=1.KE4.2Qbd.6U39_sEdq2nG&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article tells the inside story of how Bob Iger undermined and outmaneuvered Bob Chapek to return to power at Disney. Chapek was Iger's chosen successor after Iger stepped down in late February 2020. Iger stayed in the company as a creative director and executive chairman of the board after stepping down as chief executive. Chapek was still required to report to Iger, resulting in conflict. The board ultimately fired Chapek just before Thanksgiving in 2022 and replaced him with Iger.

[### Live From San Francisco: Mark Zuckerberg Tapes a Podcast With 6,000 Friends (10 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/technology/mark-zuckerberg-podcast-acquired.html?unlocked_article_code=1.KE4.kRev.ADGoLO2PTfIe&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mark Zuckerberg recorded a podcast about artificial intelligence, the metaverse, and how he outmaneuvered the rest of Silicon Valley to keep his company winning at a live event with more than 6,000 attendees who paid $50 or more for a ticket. The event included appearances from Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase; Daniel Ek, the founder of Spotify; and Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia. Tech billions and top executives have been increasingly opting to tell their stories in the friendly spaces of podcasts and YouTube streams rather than in traditional media interviews as they allow guests more leeway to expound on their pursuits and passions. The democratization of media has allowed anyone to have a personal talk show, and those in powerful positions now have a wide array of options to choose from when they want to reach the public.
