Backup and cloud storage company Backblaze has published data comparing the long-term reliability of solid-state storage drives and hard disk drives in its data center. The drives in the report were mostly 2.5-inch drives from Crucial, Seagate, and Dell, with little representation from Western Digital or SanDisk and no data from Samsung drives. SSDs failed at an overall lower rate than HDDs. After the fifth year, HDD failures increased significantly while SSD failure rates remained around the same.
