[### Email Microsoft didn't want seen reveals rushed decision to invest in OpenAI (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/email-microsoft-didnt-want-seen-reveals-rushed-decision-to-invest-in-openai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An email sent to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and CEO Satya Nadella by Kevin Scott, Microsoft's chief technology officer with the subject line 'Thoughts on OpenAI' in mid-June 2019 detailed Scott's concerns about Google's developments in AI and how it might take Microsoft multiple years to even attempt to compete with Google. Microsoft had tried to keep the email hidden, but it was made public as part of the US Justice Department's antitrust trial over Google's alleged search monopoly. Mere weeks after the email, Microsoft had invested $1 billion into OpenAI, and it has increased its investment significantly further since.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Virtual Power Plants and software (13 minute read)](https://stephendeyoung.substack.com/p/virtual-power-plants-and-software?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) reduce the need for gas and oil-based power plants by aggregating distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar and home/office batteries. These DERs help the grid by reducing or meeting demand through remote control so power plants can avoid having to burn dirty fuels during peak periods. They can also reduce the need for additional electricity grid transmission and distribution. VPPs provide a more predictable and easily managed way of helping the grid stay balanced. This article explains how VPPs work and discusses their future.

[### Two giants in the satellite telecom industry join forces to counter Starlink (7 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/the-two-largest-geostationary-satellite-operators-will-become-one/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Luxembourg-based SES is buying Intelsat for $3.1 billion. The acquisition will create a combined fleet of around 100 multi-ton satellites in geostationary orbit, more than twice the size of the next-largest commercial geostationary satellite operator. It is expected to close in the second half of 2025 and is pending regulatory approvals. Satellite operators are seeing an uptick in demand, and the US military's appetite for commercial satellite communications is going up. Both companies maintain hundreds of millions of dollars of business with the US government each year.

[### Software Friction (11 minute read)](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/software-friction/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Friction is everywhere in software development. Two setbacks are more than twice as bad as one setback. Addressing friction can also create other sources of friction. Friction is inevitable and impossible to fully remove, but there are things that can be done to reduce it, and plans can be made more resilient to it. Things that can reduce friction include smaller scopes and shorter iterations, more autonomy, better planning, automation, and using checklists and runbooks.

[### Magic machines (3 minute read)](https://world.hey.com/dhh/magic-machines-10c534bd?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Programmers tend to assign more trust to computers run by anyone but themselves. It's a lack of confidence in their own abilities that leads programmers to think that the people operating their cloud computers are smarter or better than they are. There are no magic machines and no magic operators: all systems have the same kind of potentially faulty bits and brains. It's all just computers and people.
