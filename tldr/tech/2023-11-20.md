Sam Altman was fired as CEO of OpenAI late Friday. The company's president and co-founder Greg Brockman and three senior OpenAI researchers resigned following Altman's departure. The situation is fast-moving. This article presents a timeline to make it easier to follow what's happening.

[### SpaceX launches Starship for the second time, going farther than ever before (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/18/spacex-launches-starship-for-the-second-time-ever-going-farther-than-ever-before/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX flew Starship for the second time on November 18. While both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship upper stage had to be blown up mid-air, the test was still a huge success for SpaceX. It appears that the new water deluge system successfully protected the launch infrastructure. The hot staging separation technique was also successful. A video of the test is available in the article.

[### Scientists 3D print a robotic hand with human-like bones and tendons (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/11/scientists-3d-print-a-robotic-hand-with-human-like-bones-and-tendons/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

One of the reasons robots seem to move differently from living creatures is due to their lack of bones and flexible tissues. Researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and US-based startup Inkbit have figured out how to 3D print a robotic hand with an internal structure composed of human-like bones, ligaments, and tendons. The technique can create robots that outperform hard robots in terms of flexibility and overcome the design and scale-related issues faced by soft robots. A picture of the 3D-printed robot hand is available in the article.

[### Why superconductor research is in a ‚Äògolden age‚Äô ‚Äî despite controversy (9 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03551-z?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Superconductivity research is enjoying somewhat of a renaissance fueled in part by the new capabilities of computer simulations to predict the existence and properties of undiscovered materials. Scientists have unearthed several families of materials over the past few years that could have revolutionary properties. This article covers some of the history behind superconductivity research and the current state of the field.

[### All of the writing I did in a week as a software engineer (7 minute read)](https://alexanderell.is/posts/writing-swe/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Empathy and communication are less obvious skills that are helpful for working as a software engineer. One of the ways software engineers communicate is through writing. This article takes a look at all of the writing that a software engineer working at the Cloud Gateway team at Netflix does in a single week. In a week, the engineer wrote zero emails, a few dozen lines of code, a handful of Jira tickets, a couple of investigation and debugging docs, a few technical docs, and hundreds of Slack messages. An ergonomic keyboard is a very worthwhile investment.

[### A Timeline of the OpenAI Board (7 minute read)](https://loeber.substack.com/p/a-timeline-of-the-openai-board?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's board has undergone numerous changes over the years, especially recently. These changes weren't big news, so they didn't spark the concerns that they maybe should have. This blog post goes through the Internet Archive and OpenAI's non-profit filings to try to make sense of OpenAI's governance. It attempts to chronicle the composition of OpenAI's board, point out conflicts, and show what led to Sam Altman being fired. It should be noted that the people involved in this act of corporate governance are roughly the same people trying to position themselves to govern policy on artificial intelligence.

The path to achieving artificial general intelligence remains a topic of debate among scientists. A team of scientists from Google DeepMind has proposed a new framework for classifying the capabilities and behavior of AGI systems and their precursors. It is critical for the AI research community to explicitly reflect on what it means when discussing AGI. This article explores the framework, which includes criteria for measuring artificial intelligence, a matrix that measures performance and generality, and another matrix for measuring autonomy and risk.
