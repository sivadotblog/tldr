[### China is running the EV playbook on humanoid robots — and it's working (5 minute read)](https://restofworld.org/2026/china-humanoid-robots-unitree-agibot-tesla-optimus/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nearly 90% of all humanoid robots sold globally last year were Chinese. The humanoid robot industry is still in its infancy, but China's progress will potentially lock it into a commanding position. Its early advantage is due to a combination of policy support, public investment, a mature supply chain, and advancements made in AI software and hardware. The global market for humanoid robots in 2035 is estimated to grow to $38 billion.

SpaceX and xAI signed a merger agreement at the end of last month. Merging the two companies is a level of risk-taking and ambition that is novel even for Elon Musk.

[### Death of Software. Nah (13 minute read)](https://x.com/stevesi/status/2019167552794948020?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Wall Street tends to run in herds, and the past couple of weeks have seen the herd collectively conclude that software is somehow dead. This is nonsense. There will be more software than ever before. AI-enabled or AI-centric software is simply moving up the stack of what a product is. Domain experience will become more important than it is today because every domain will become vastly more sophisticated than it is now.
