[### Anthropic's Haiku 3.5 surprises experts with an ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù price increase (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/anthropic-raises-eyebrows-with-haiku-price-hike-citing-increased-intelligence/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthropic launched the latest version of its smallest AI model, Claude 3.5 Haiku, with a 4x price increase on Monday. The company says that the price increase reflects the model's increase in intelligence. The new Haiku model costs users $1 per million input tokens and $5 per million output tokens. Anthropic's testing indicates that the new Haiku model surpasses Claude 3 Opus, which costs $15 per million input tokens and $75 per million output tokens.

[### World's 1st cloned ferret gives birth to healthy kits in a conservation milestone (4 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/worlds-first-cloned-ferret-gives-birth?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A cloned black-footed ferret has given birth to two healthy kits, a milestone that represents a significant step to securing the future of the endangered mammal. The cloned ferret was created from genetic material collected in 1988 and preserved at the San Diego Zoo's Frozen Zoo. The sample was unique in its genetic diversity, meaning its genes could strengthen the current population's health and resilience. All living black-footed ferrets, except for clones and the new kits, descend from seven wild ferrets. The limited gene pool makes the population highly vulnerable to diseases and less adaptable to environmental changes.

[### World's first wooden satellite launched into space (3 minute read)](https://www.dw.com/en/worlds-first-wooden-satellite-launched-into-space/a-70691359?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Japanese researchers launched the world's first wooden satellite into space yesterday. The satellite is made of honoki, a kind of magnolia tree traditionally used to make sword sheaths. The researchers believe that the material can be used to build structures in space. They plan to collect data on the satellite for six months, and if the experiment is successful, pitch the idea of wooden satellites to SpaceX. Pictures of the wooden satellite are available in the article.

[### New OpenAI feature: Predicted Outputs (2 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/4/predicted-outputs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The OpenAI API has a new feature called Predicted Outputs. It allows users to send content as a 'prediction' and have GPT-4o or GPT-4o mini use that content to accelerate the returned result. Any tokens provided in predictions that are not part of the final completion will be charged at completion token rates. This means the more an output differs from the prediction, the more it will cost. Using Predicted Outputs can reduce processing time.

[### Why software only moves forward (11 minute read)](https://swizec.com/blog/why-software-only-moves-forward/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Software only moves forward mostly because of data. Code needs to understand saved states, especially if that state leaves a system to become distributed. Developers can usually update code, but not the database. Distributed systems greatly increase the complexity of this problem. This article provides some tips on how to update software while keeping users happy.

[### Apple reportedly facing first-ever EU fine over App Store rules (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24289067/apple-eu-fine-digital-markets-act-app-store?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The EU Commission is planning to fine Apple over the company's 'anti-steering' practices, which harm competition in the App Store. It is unknown how much the EU plans to fine Apple, but the Digital Markets Act says companies can be charged up to 10% of annual global revenue and up to 20% for repeat offenses. The initial fine could be as much as $38 billion based on Apple's revenue last year. Apple is also facing an investigation over whether it is undermining alternative app stores in the EU.

[### Why the deep learning boom caught almost everyone by surprise (23 minute read)](https://www.understandingai.org/p/why-the-deep-learning-boom-caught?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1501429&amp;post_id=151220451&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=17m06t&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email)

The AI boom of the last 12 years was made possible by three visionaries who pursued unorthodox ideas in the face of widespread criticism. Geoffrey Hinton spent decades promoting neural networks despite near-universal skepticism. Jensen Huang recognized early that GPUs could be useful for more than just graphics. Fei-Fei Li created an image data set that turned out to be essential for demonstrating the potential of neural networks trained on GPUs. This article tells the story of how these figures contributed to the AI boom.
