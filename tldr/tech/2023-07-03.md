### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Microsoft unveils the world's first analog optical computer to solve optimization problems (5 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/first-analog-optical-computer-microsoft?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft's Analog Interactive Machine (AIM) uses both binary and continuous variables to solve problems of optimization at a lightning-fast pace. The system uses optics and electronics to process continuous value data and perform vector-matrix multiplications. Its components have been miniaturized to fit centimeter-scale chips - the AIM is no bigger than a rack enclosure. Optical computers could open up new fields of research while also reducing resources spent on performing complex calculations.

[### World's 1st 'tooth regrowth' medicine moves toward clinical trials in Japan (4 minute read)](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20230609/p2a/00m/0sc/026000c?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A Japanese research team is set to begin clinical trials in July 2024 on a medication that might allow people to grow new teeth. If everything goes to plan, the team plans to have the medication ready for general use in 2030. The medicine is intended for people who lack a full set of adult teeth due to a congenital condition called anodontia. It works by blocking a certain protein's function. If the drug works in humans, it will be a game-changer for the entire field of dentistry.
