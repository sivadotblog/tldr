The life expectancy of someone in the US infected with HIV is currently about the same as the rest of the population. This is largely due to antiretroviral therapy, a daily treatment regimen that decreases the level of HIV in a person's blood to the point it's no longer detectable or transmittable.

New universal cures are now on the horizon.
