[### Goodbye low test coverage and slow QA cycles (Sponsor)](https://www.qawolf.com?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=ACQ_All_Demo_Conversions__NewsletterAudience_-_Newsletter_GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_20251118-None_Experiment-FALSE&amp;utm_term=headline-GoodbyeLowTestCoverageAndSlowQACycles&amp;utm_content=GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_ScheduleADemoToLearnMore_None_Headline%3AGoodbyeLowTestCoverageAndSlowQACycles____Newsletter-PrimaryPlacement_20251118_v1_)

Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there) is hard and pricey for any team.

[QA Wolf's](https://www.qawolf.com?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ACQ_All_Demo_Conversions__NewsletterAudience_-_Newsletter_GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_20251118-None_Experiment-FALSE&utm_term=body-QAWolf&utm_content=GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_ScheduleADemoToLearnMore_None_Headline%3AGoodbyeLowTestCoverageAndSlowQACycles____Newsletter-PrimaryPlacement_20251118_v1_) AI-native solution provides high-volume, high-speed test coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organization's QA cycle to minutes.

They can get you:

* [80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks](https://www.qawolf.com/how-it-works?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ACQ_All_Demo_Conversions__NewsletterAudience_-_Newsletter_GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_20251118-None_Experiment-FALSE&utm_term=body-80PercentAutomatedE2ETestCoverageInWeeks&utm_content=GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_ScheduleADemoToLearnMore_None_Headline%3AGoodbyeLowTestCoverageAndSlowQACycles____Newsletter-PrimaryPlacement_20251118_v1_)—not years
* [Unlimited parallel test runs](https://www.qawolf.com/how-it-works?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ACQ_All_Demo_Conversions__NewsletterAudience_-_Newsletter_GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_20251118-None_Experiment-FALSE&utm_term=body-UnlimitedParallelTestRuns&utm_content=GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_ScheduleADemoToLearnMore_None_Headline%3AGoodbyeLowTestCoverageAndSlowQACycles____Newsletter-PrimaryPlacement_20251118_v1_)
* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The benefit? No more manual E2E testing. No more slow QA cycles. No more bugs reaching production.

[### Blue Origin No Longer Just a Rocket Company as Mars ‘on Radar' (1 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-17/blue-origin-no-longer-just-a-rocket-company-as-mars-on-radar?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzQ0NDczMCwiZXhwIjoxNzY0MDQ5NTMwLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVYyQ0hUOTZPU0cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.kog4dSYH6FvzPiBYUCGvX8cU6QR2IXdi_zkWiEcYguc&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Blue Origin is now a manufacturing company that can build rockets at scale. The firm's mission has grown beyond just launching payloads. To go to the Moon, the company must be able to build all of the hardware needed to get to orbit at a rate fast enough to sustain large-scale missions. Blue Origin successfully landed its New Glenn booster for the first time last week. It is looking to conduct another New Glenn launch next year.

[### Jeff Bezos Creates AI Start-Up Where He Will Be Co-Chief Executive (5 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/technology/bezos-project-prometheus.html?unlocked_article_code=1.2E8._8MO.rzmQzjywD6Jh&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Jeff Bezos' new company, Project Prometheus, is coming out of the gates with $6.2 billion in funding and nearly 100 employees, including researchers poached from OpenAI, DeepMind, and Meta. The company is focused on AI that will help engineering and manufacturing in a number of fields. It will create systems that can learn from the physical world in more complex ways than chatbots do. Bezos will be co-chief executive - this is the first time he has taken a formal operational role in a company since stepping down as chief executive of Amazon in July 2021.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### China is one step closer to perpetual energy independence (9 minute read)](https://huabinoliver.substack.com/p/china-is-one-step-closer-to-perpetual?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An experimental reactor built in the Gobi Desert has achieved thorium-to-uranium fuel conversion, bringing humanity one step closer to an almost endless supply of nuclear energy. Thorium is much more abundant and accessible than uranium and generates far less radioactive waste. The entire thorium-to-uranium process takes place inside the reactor core, eliminating the need for external fuel fabrication. The system, which uses molten salt, requires no water at all, allowing it to be built almost anywhere.

[### Today, Valar Atomics became the first startup in history to split the atom (2 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1990535382438719825.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Valar Atomics' Project Nova core achieved zero-power criticality for the first time yesterday morning. Zero-power criticality is a foundation milestone that precedes nuclear operation with power. The achievement will allow Valar to gain a greater understanding of the neutronic characteristics of the core and verify assumptions about fuel, moderators, active reactivity control, and burnable poisons. It marks a decisive step toward commercial-scale, factory-built nuclear reactors capable of powering heavy industry, hydrogen production, and AI-era data infrastructure with carbon-free energy.

[### 112 tools, $5,000 per employee: Forrester reveals the real costs of tool sprawl (Sponsor)](https://miro.com/events/webinar-forrester-beyond-tool-sprawl/?utm_campaign=glb-26-glb-wb-hi-tc_dsp-webinar_series_forrester&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Forrester%20Webinar&amp;utm_term=TLDR&amp;src=-newsletter_glb)

Large organizations spend nearly $5,000 per person annually on enterprise tools. But according to [Forrester's latest research](https://miro.com/events/webinar-forrester-beyond-tool-sprawl/?utm_campaign=glb-26-glb-wb-hi-tc_dsp-webinar_series_forrester&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Forrester%20Webinar&utm_term=TLDR&src=-newsletter_glb), cutting costs isn't about eliminating tools — it's about cutting friction. In this webinar with Miro, Forrester's Bobby Cameron breaks down why consolidation only focused on ROI fails and introduces the High-Performance IT framework for smarter tool consolidation decisions.

[### Human behavior is an intuition-pump for AI risk (29 minute read)](https://invertedpassion.com/human-behavior-is-an-intuition-pump-for-ai-risk/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It's wise to take a pause and look around when one faces uncertainties. Taking a temporary pause on training larger AI models isn't taking a Luddite stance. Leaders at AI companies have a probability of doom as high as 25% and yet keep racing to build bigger, more powerful AI models. Instead of racing towards something we don't understand and may not be able to control, we should pause and search for answers.

[### Europe Begins Rethinking Its Crackdown on Big Tech (9 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/technology/europe-big-tech.html?unlocked_article_code=1.2E8.5NFL.YWtUkeBxv4Ws&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The European Commission plans to unveil a 'digital package of simplification' tomorrow that will rewrite key aspects of the General Data Protection Regulation and delay parts of a law restricting certain uses of AI. The EU's tech laws have long been criticized for stifling economic growth. The digital simplification package is part of a broader deregulatory push.
