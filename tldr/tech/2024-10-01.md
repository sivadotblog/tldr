OpenAI's upcoming investment round includes a term where the company has two years to convert to a for-profit business or the funding will convert into debt. While convertible notes are common, this is essentially the opposite. This could be a very real problem for the company in a couple of years if it is neither a for-profit nor insanely profitable.

[### Y Combinator Traded Prestige for Growth (4 minute read)](https://unfashionable.blog/p/yc/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Reputation and prestige are everything. The reason Harvard doesn't accept a higher percentage of applicants isn't because it can't scale, but because it chooses not to. Its success lies in exclusivity. Y Combinator is trading its reputation capital for money - it now looks like it is willing to fund just about anything, which means that the accelerator isn't doing any real due diligence and doesn't care about its existing portfolio companies. It is no longer an exclusive club that signals legitimacy.

[### Epic Games Sues Google, Samsung Over Alleged App-Store Scheme (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/epic-games-to-sue-google-samsung-over-alleged-app-store-scheme-e1744d35?st=iaj4DT&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Epic is suing Google and Samsung, claiming that the tech giants colluded to place onerous restrictions on app stores. The lawsuit alleges that Google and Samsung made it too difficult for consumers to download app stores from outside software developers by making a feature called Auto Blocker active by default on Samsung's newest smartphones. The feature prevents users from downloading alternative app stores. Turning off the feature and installing a third-party app store requires 21 steps. The friction has caused 50% of users trying to install the Epic Games Store on Android to give up before they've gotten it installed.
