[### New kind of chicken lays eggs that don‚Äôt have allergy protein (2 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/health/egg-allergy?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Up to 2% of children experience egg allergies. They usually outgrow their egg allergy by the time they are 16, but until then, they have to avoid eating eggs and products that contain eggs, including flu vaccines. Researchers from Japan have used gene-editing technology to create chickens that lay eggs without the protein most likely to trigger an egg allergy. As even a small amount of the protein can be life-threatening to someone with a severe egg allergy, the researchers plan to perform more studies on these eggs before claiming that their eggs will not trigger reactions.
