[### Computer chip with built-in human brain tissue gets military funding (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/computers/human-brain-chip-ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

DishBrain is a semi-biological computer chip with human and mouse brains lab-grown into its electrodes created by Monash University scientists. The project attracted a $407,000 grant from Australia's National Intelligence and Security Discovery Research Grants program after the chips demonstrated the ability to learn to play the game Pong within five minutes. These types of chips may eventually become a new form of machine intelligence. The funds from the grant will be used to scale up the hardware and methods used to create the chips to the point where they become a viable replacement for silicon computing.
