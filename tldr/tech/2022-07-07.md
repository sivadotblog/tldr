[### Cloned mice created from freeze dried skin cells in world first (2 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/05/cloned-mice-created-from-freeze-dried-skin-cells-in-world-first?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have cloned mice from freeze-dried skin cells. Storing skin cells for cloning in liquid nitrogen can be expensive and risky. Freeze-drying the samples allows cells to be preserved cheaply and safely, even in developing countries. While the process can produce both males and females, it can be used to create only females to revive endangered species where only males survive. The resulting clones are fertile.

[### Tiny shapeshifting robots brush and floss your teeth, kill bacteria (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/shapeshifting-robots-brush-floss-teeth/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Engineers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a system of microrobots that can change shape to form bristles or floss and release antimicrobials to kill bad bacteria. The system is made up of iron oxide nanoparticles that can be controlled using magnetic fields. The iron oxide activates hydrogen peroxide, which produces free radicals that kill bacteria and biofilms. The system could allow people with reduced motor skills to still take care of their oral health.
