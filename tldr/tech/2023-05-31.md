[### Half of children given skinny jab no longer clinically obese US study (2 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/17/half-of-children-given-skinny-jab-no-longer-clinically-obese-us-study?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nearly half of children dosed with semaglutide in a study lost enough weight to no longer be classed as clinically obese. Almost three-quarters of the children assigned the drug had an improvement in at least one BMI category by the end of the study, compared with just under a fifth on the placebo. The study demonstrates the high degree of clinical effectiveness the drug has in adolescents with obesity. While the drug may have transformative effects for people living with obesity, doctors warn that it is not a quick fix and that it should be used in conjunction with lifestyle therapies and other anti-obesity measures.
