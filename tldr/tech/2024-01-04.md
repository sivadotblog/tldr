[### Meta's CTO calls its AR glasses prototype "the most advanced thing we've ever produced as a species" (3 minute read)](https://mixed-news.com/en/bosworth-orion-ar-glasses-2024/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta plans to possibly unveil an AR glasses prototype in 2024 that it claims is the most advanced piece of technology on the planet in its domain. The device is still prohibitively expensive to manufacture and there is still a lot of work to be done to reduce the price and form factor. Meta may be working on a version of the Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses with a small viewfinder display. AI breakthroughs and the integration of AI into the current Ray-Ban Meta smartglasses have significantly affected Meta's product roadmap.

Chinese labs working on replicating LK-99 findings have discovered a superconductor that works at -23 C. While it is not exactly a room-temperature conductor, it is still a significant discovery. Similar materials have been discovered previously, but they require high pressure to exhibit their superconducting properties. The labs' results have already been replicated.

[### SIEVE is simpler than LRU (8 minute read)](https://cachemon.github.io/SIEVE-website/blog/2023/12/17/sieve-is-simpler-than-lru/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Caching involves storing temporary data for quick access. Eviction algorithms determine what data to keep and what to discard. SIEVE is a simple and effective cache eviction algorithm with just one queue. It can also serve as a cache primitive for designing more advanced eviction policies. SIEVE is not scan-resistant, so it can sometimes show a higher miss ratio than other tools.

[### The protocol force (3 minute read)](https://glazkov.com/2024/01/02/the-protocol-force/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The protocol force encourages the layer between consumers of value and producers of value to be as thin as possible. IP, HTTP, and HTML are great examples of this effect. The protocol force minimizes the cost of reaching as many consumers or producers as possible. This force is present in any layered stack that has producers and consumers as outer layers. One of the key challenges of designing versatile tools is that this middle layer is constantly tested and often broken.
