[### New Wi-Fi Reflection Tech Could Send Signal Through Impenetrable Walls (2 minute read)](https://www.newsweek.com/new-wifi-reflection-tech-could-send-signal-through-impenetrable-walls-1732088?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Austrian scientists have developed a technique to eliminate wave reflections caused by physical interference. The technique involves covering walls with an anti-reflective coating. Walls scatter waves in different ways, so the scientists had to measure how each wall reflected waves and then create a custom coating for every wall. The technology could help improve Wi-Fi, imaging processes, and mobile communication technology.

[### Scientists hid encryption key for Wizard of Oz text in plastic molecules (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/scientists-encoded-the-wizard-of-oz-in-the-chemical-structure-of-ink/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from Austin, Texas were able to hide an encryption key within a special ink. They used sequence-defined polymers (SDPs), long chains of monomers that can carry a sequence of information, to store the encryption key. The SDPs were mixed with isopropanol, glycerol, and soot to create the special ink. Stored messages on SDPs can be decoded using depolymerization and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The technique was able to successfully store 256 bits of data.
