[### Apple Readies Pair of Headsets While Still Looking Ahead to Glasses (13 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-13/apple-vision-pro-2-details-low-latency-headset-ar-glasses-ipados-19-details-m9flf1fd?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NDU3NTI5OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1MTgwMDk4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVU5PMEZUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.-H6-hqA1CNYVsfNsDNhe8RzaOZectD0XFh0mDZNQJrU&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is developing two new Vision Pro headsets despite glasses being a bigger goal in the long run. The company is also preparing to overhaul iPadOS to make its tablets more like Macs. iPhones made in China have been exempted from tariffs. Apple will not move production back to the US - instead, it is going all-out on India as its US production source. It would be impossible to move iPhone manufacturing back to the US.

While OpenAI is still not yet profitable, it is currently valued at $300 billion. ChatGPT was the most downloaded app on app stores last month.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Experimental drug looks to be gastric bypass surgery in pill form (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/experimental-drug-looks-to-be-gastric-bypass-surgery-in-pill-form/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The popularity of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss has led to companies competing to make new and improved anti-obesity medications. Boston-based Syntis Bio has created a daily pill that mimics the effects of gastric bypass without actual surgery. The drug is designed to redirect the absorption of nutrients from the beginning of the small intestine to its end, changing how the body absorbs food and leaving people feeling fuller from eating less. Early data from animals and a small group of humans shows that the pill is safe and may be able to suppress hunger.

[### No code is dead. Long live vibe coding (1 minute read)](https://kenneth.io/post/no-code-is-dead-long-live-vibe-coding?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

No- and low-code abstractions promised to democratize software creation, but the technology didn't even come close to replacing code or traditional programming. A decade later, vibe coding is showing that prompt-to-code workflows are possible. Large language models allow people to create actual code not locked into proprietary runtimes. They can generate code written to open standards, leverage industry best practices, and deploy to open infrastructure.

[### Sam Altman at TED today (3 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1910820537783423078.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's user base has doubled in just the past few weeks. The company plans to release a powerful open-source model near the frontier in response to DeepSeek. It is becoming much less restrictive on speech harms and taking a more permissive stance due to feedback that people don't want censorship. Sam Altman says that having a child changed a lot in him - but he doesn't think his kids will ever be smarter than AI.

[### What's Wrong With Apple? (8 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/technology/apple-issues-trump-tariffs.html?unlocked_article_code=1._U4.oZ8W.8nZ3x6Y30CLa&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It's been a decade since the release of Apple's most recent commercial successes - the Apple Watch and AirPods. The company's services lag behind rivals in subscriptions and half of its sales still come from the iPhone. Vision Pro sales were disappointing, but it was the company's issues with Apple Intelligence that exposed the dysfunction within the organization. There seems to be a breakdown of leadership, communication, and internal processes at Apple.
