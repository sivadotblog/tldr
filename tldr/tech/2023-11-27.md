Tesla has started releasing its Full Self-Driving v12 update to employees. The biggest difference with the update is how vehicle controls will be taken over by neural nets rather than being hardcoded by engineers. Tesla may be able to push the update to customers by the end of the year. Elon Musk has previously said that he believes that Tesla will achieve true self-driving capability by the end of the year.

SpaceX plans to test Starship for the third time in December. There are now three ships in final production. SpaceX launched the second Starship test on November 18. The ship successfully performed a hot-stage separation, but it exploded after it completed a flap and boostback burn.

[### ‚ÄòTreasure trove‚Äô of new CRISPR systems holds promise for genome editing (3 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03697-w?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers used an algorithm to sort through millions of genomes to find new rare types of CRISPR systems that could eventually be adopted into genome-editing tools. Single-celled bacteria and archaea use CRISPR systems to defend themselves against bacteriophages. The algorithm helped scientists identify the code for an entirely unknown CRISPR system that targets RNA. Researchers will be able to use the algorithm to look for other types of protein across species.

[### Need a PRNG? Use a CSPRNG (10 minute read)](https://sortingsearching.com/2023/11/25/random.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Developers should always use a Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (CSPRNG) when choosing a Pseudorandom Number Generator. While people typically say to only use CSPRNGs when doing cryptography and need security against adversarial attackers, they are really the only thing that makes sense to use. This article talks about why developers should only use CSPRNGs by comparing them with other random number generation methods. CSPRNGs are better by definition as given the first n bits, there is no efficient algorithm that will predict the next bit with a success rate non-negligibly better than 50%.

RAGs is a Streamlit app that lets users create RAG pipelines from data sources using natural language. Users just have to describe the tasks and parameters they want from their RAG systems. The RAG can be queried and it will answer questions over the data.

[### The Failed Commodification Of Technical Work (10 minute read)](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-failed-commodification-of-technical-work/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

It's difficult to commodify technical work. Despite the crazy infrastructure that allows us to mass produce things, in many cases, individual people make the machine run. Society runs on commodification, but anyone who thinks that it can run on pure commodification, without any understanding of the human complexities of the people around them, is wrong.

[### The Bond villain compliance strategy (15 minute read)](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/bond-villain-compliance-strategy/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Binance and its CEO recently pleaded guilty to operating the world's largest criminal conspiracy to launder money and paid more than $4 billion in fines. This article looks at the history of Binance to see what led to this outcome. The ruling settles a long-running investigation involving the DOJ, CFTC, FinCEN, and assorted other parts of the US regulatory state. However, it importantly doesn't resolve the SEC's parallel action, which includes charges of operating an unregistered exchange, misrepresenting trading controls, and the unregistered offer and sale of securities.
