The large number of subreddits shifting to private to protest Reddit's new API pricing terms caused Reddit to crash. Reddit started experiencing issues on Monday morning. The outage was fully resolved by 1:28PM ET. More than 7,000 subreddits have gone private or read-only as part of the protest. Some subreddits will return to normal on June 14, but others have decided to continue the protest until changes are made. Reddit said on Sunday that it wasn't planning any changes to what's been announced.

[### A Developer's View of Vision Pro (8 minute read)](https://www.david-smith.org/blog/2023/06/12/new-post/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's Vision Pro justifies its expensive price tag by delivering an incredible user experience. Apps for the device will likely go the same way as apps for iOS, meaning there will probably be a rush to the bottom with pricing and then a general user expectation that software should be free. While there might not be the same gold rush for apps on visionOS compared to on iOS, there are still many reasons for developers to be excited about the platform.

[### Killing Community (4 minute read)](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/82_killing_community/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Online communities help people find a sense of belonging where they might struggle to do so in real life. When a community grows too fast, a stranger-culture emerges where people are more guarded. The sense of belonging to the community is eroded, and people feel more anonymous. Social media sites that are run like startups have to hit growth targets to impress investors. This unsustainable growth destroys communities and lowers the quality of interactions for users.
