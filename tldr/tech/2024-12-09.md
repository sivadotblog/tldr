[### Apple 'Investigating' Macs With Cellular Connectivity (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-cellular-mac-custom-modem/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is investigating the possibility of adding a modern chip to a future Mac, but a cellular Mac isn't likely to launch until 2026 or later. The company plans to introduce its custom-built 5G chip early in 2025. It will be added to the iPhone SE, low-cost iPad, and iPhone 17 Air. The chip will be expanded to other iPhones and iPads over a three-year period. The first-generation chip will be limited to sub-6GHz 5G speeds, but the second-generation version will support faster mmWave technology.

[### Appeals Court Upholds U.S. Ban of TikTok (8 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/tik-tok-congress-ban-court-ruling-1f0d6837?st=X7jsrY&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A federal appeals court has ruled that TikTok can be banned in the US over national security concerns. The ruling rejected arguments that the ban was an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. The ban was intended solely to limit a foreign nation's ability to gather data on people in the US. TikTok claims US security fears are speculative and overblown. It is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, but the justices are not obliged to hear the case.

[### Lower-cost sodium-ion batteries are finally having their moment (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/lower-cost-sodium-ion-batteries-are-finally-having-their-moment/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer, has announced its second-generation sodium-ion battery, which has an energy density of 200 watt-hours per kilogram. The company plans to start mass production of the battery in 2027. Sodium-ion batteries perform better than lithium-ion batteries in extreme cold and they carry a much lower risk of fire. The process for manufacturing sodium-ion batteries is similar to that of lithium-ion batteries, so existing assembly lines can be reused without having to spend heavily on retooling. Their biggest disadvantage is low energy density, but they have the potential to be cost-competitive with lithium-ion batteries.

[### Intel looks beyond silicon, outlines breakthroughs in atomically-thin 2D transistors, chip packaging, and interconnects at IEDM 2024 (6 minute read)](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-looks-beyond-silicon-outlines-breakthroughs-in-atomically-thin-2d-transistors-chip-packaging-and-interconnects-at-iedm-2024?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Intel's Foundry Technology Research team has announced technology breakthroughs in 2D transistor technology. It plans to unveil its research at the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting 2024 conference. The research includes enhancements in gate-all-around transistor scaling and performance both with silicon and with atomically-thin 2D transistors that use beyond-silicon materials. It also outlines Intel's subtractive Ruthenium technology, which improves interconnect performance and scalability, ultimately enabling smaller wires between transistors, and a chip packaging breakthrough that improves chip-to-chip assembly throughput by 100x.
