[### A.I. could open new routes to psychiatric treatments by mapping psychedelic trips in the brain (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/ai-psychiatric-treatments-mapping-brain?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=article&utm_content=19032022?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers used artificial intelligence to map people's subjective experiences while using psychedelics to specific regions of the brain. The study involved analyzing self-reported psychedelic drug experiences and linking the most commonly used words with receptors in the brain known to bind to each drug. It found new links and patterns that confirm existing research. The insights could lead to new ways to produce desired treatment effects for a range of psychiatric conditions.

[### Mice Study Reveals a New Method to Unlock The Blood-Brain Barrier (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-reveal-a-new-method-for-unlocking-the-blood-brain-barrier?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have found a way to control the blood-brain barrier at a molecular level and open it up for a couple of hours at a time. The absence of a molecule called Unc5B left the blood-brain barrier open in tests on adult mice. Researchers then developed an antibody to block the receptor that the molecule was binding to. This allowed the team to open up the blood-brain barrier for some time to promote drug delivery. The research could lead to better treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors.

[### A big bet to kill the password for good (8 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/a-big-bet-to-kill-the-password-for-good/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The FIDO Alliance, an industry association that specifically works on secure authentication, has published a white paper on its vision for solving the usability issues associated with passwordless features. It identifies the process for switching or adding devices as being the main thing preventing passwordless schemes from achieving mass adoption. The proposed solution involves operating systems developing a credential management system that can sync between devices. It would allow people to use existing hardware to physically authenticate new devices. Introducing passwordless schemes will make phishing a thing of the past.

[### Open Source Maintainer Sabotages Code to Wipe Russian, Belarusian Computers (3 minute read)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dypeek/open-source-sabotage-node-ipc-wipe-russia-belraus-computers?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A software developer who maintains a repository for a popular networking tool, node-ipc, recently updated the software to make it add a file containing a message of peace to users' desktops. While the developer claims that the update only added the file, users in Belarus and Russia reported that it overwrote files on their computers with a heart emoji. The reaction to the update was extremely negative. The developer is now being targeted by hackers.
