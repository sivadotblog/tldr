[### A Meta prototype lets you build virtual worlds by describing them (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22947217/meta-prototype-builder-bot-ai-world-creation-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mark Zuckerberg recently showed off a prototype of an artificial intelligence system that lets people build parts of virtual worlds by verbally describing them. Builder Bot can create 3D scenes with sound effects and background audio. It is unknown if it generates the designs or if it uses a library of human-created models. Many unique moderation problems will come with the tech, so it probably won't be available any time soon. A video from Meta with Zuckerberg demonstrating the technology is available in the article.

[### Quantum Sensor Opens ‚Äòa New Window into the Underground‚Äô (5 minute read)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyp5zz/quantum-sensor-opens-a-new-window-into-the-underground?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team of physicists and engineers have successfully tested a quantum gravity gradiometer. Quantum gravity gradiometers can map out underground spaces without physically digging into them. They have the potential to assess a wide range of environments. The sensors work by manipulating the quantum properties of atoms to measure minute variations in gravitational fields. In a real-world test, the sensor was able to detect a tunnel buried three feet beneath a road.

[### Meta announces plans to build an AI-powered ‚Äòuniversal speech translator‚Äô (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22947368/meta-facebook-ai-universal-speech-translation-project?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta has announced an AI research project to create translation software that works for everyone in the world. Roughly 20% of the world speaks languages not covered by current translation tools. Many of these languages don't have easily accessible texts in the quantity required to train AI systems. Meta will develop tools to train AI models using fewer training examples and a system to directly translate speech in real-time without the need for a written component to serve as an intermediary. There is no set timeframe for completing the project.

Balkanatolia is a landmass that existed 40 million years ago between the Balkan and Anatolian peninsulas. Fossil records suggest that it helped Asian mammals migrate into Europe. The temporary land bridge paved the way for an extinction event known as the Grande Coupure that reshaped the fauna of Europe around 34 million years ago. Scientists are still uncovering fossils to understand the wildlife and geographic significance of Balkanatolia.
