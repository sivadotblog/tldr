Android XR is a mixed-reality operating system that will power future headsets and glasses. The first headset powered by the OS will be Project Moohan, a mixed-reality headset built by Samsung available for purchase next year. Project Moohan seems to be aimed at the same use purposes as the Apple Vision Pro. Android XR is available for developers now.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Waymo's market share is now equal to Lyft within SF (2 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1867257473671082356.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

When Waymo launched in August last year, Uber and Lyft were at 66% and 34% market share in San Francisco. 15 months later, Waymo is at 22% market share, the same as Lyft, while Uber sits at 55%. Waymo's wait times are longer than Uber and Lyft because the company doesn't have enough cars on the road. It's possible that Waymo's market share will climb even faster as it puts more cars on the road and reduces wait times to be in line with its competition.

[### Those designer babies everyone is freaking out about – it's not likely to happen (7 minute read)](https://theconversation.com/those-designer-babies-everyone-is-freaking-out-about-its-not-likely-to-happen-103079?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Geneticists cannot read the genetic code and know who will be about average in intelligence and athleticism. Traits and diseases that result from multiple genes and lifestyle factors cannot be predicted using just DNA. Designer babies aren't possible now and will unlikely be possible in the future. The creation of designer babies is not limited by technology, but by biology.

[### Netflix's Extraordinary Parental Leave Was Part of Its Culture. That's Over (14 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/netflix-unlimited-parental-leave-roll-back-culture-a962f50e?st=8GcnRs&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Netflix made headlines nearly a decade ago when it pledged to give new parents unlimited time off in their child's first year. More staffers than expected took full advantage of the benefit, which Netflix found unsustainable. The company has spent the last few years walking back the policy. Netflix's new mindset of cost-consciousness has aided its recovery from a sluggish period. The long-term risk for Netflix is that the characteristics that made its workplace distinct will erode, making it harder to attract and retain talent.
