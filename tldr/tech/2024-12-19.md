[### U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear challenge to TikTok ban (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-will-hear-arguments.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on a law that would effectively ban TikTok if ByteDance doesn't sell it. TikTok is arguing that the law violates the US Constitution's free speech protections. Oral arguments are scheduled for January 10, nine days before the law is set to take effect. Congress passed the law due to concerns that TikTok's Chinese ownership presented a national security risk.

Apple has halted work on a project to build an iPhone hardware subscription service. The service would have allowed customers to pay a monthly fee and receive a new phone each year. It would have competed with Apple's wireless carrier partners, who rely on installment programs to sell devices and retain customers. Apple may have canceled the program due to stricter rules by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### First baby conceived via breakthrough fertility tech born (5 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/medical/fertility-tech-stem-cells-first-birth/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Gameto's Fertilo procedure differs from traditional IVF because it takes ovarian support cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and co-cultures them with an immature egg to mimic the natural egg maturation process in the lab. It significantly improves egg maturation and embryo formation. The procedure avoids 80% of the hormone injections that traditional IVF requires and reduces the duration of a treatment cycle to three days. The first live human baby conceived using the technique was recently born. Gameto has partnered with Australian IVF clinic chain IVFAustralia to make the procedure available to patients at select clinics throughout the country.

Seagate has been experimenting with heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) since at least 2002. The company is set to release HAMR hard drives based on its Mozaic 3+ platform in standard drive sizes. Getting from the theoretical concept of HAMR to an actual drive required countless engineering hours. Seagate has not released prices yet, but the product page for the Exos M shows 30 and 32TB capacities.

[### Amazon's RTO delays exemplify why workers get so mad about mandates (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/amazons-rto-delays-highlight-why-workers-get-so-mad-about-mandates/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Despite mandating that office workers start working in the office five days a week starting in January, Amazon still doesn't have enough office space to accommodate its employees. The company has delayed return-to-office dates for personnel in at least seven cities. Some offices won't have sufficient space until April or May. Amazon claims that most employees will have office space by January 2 and that most of the pushed-back return-to-office days are related to buildings being laid out differently for part-time workers rather than insufficient physical space.
