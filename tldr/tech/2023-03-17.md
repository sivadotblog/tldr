[### World’s first mRNA vaccine against deadly plague bacteria is 100% effective (2 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/health/mrna-vaccine-plague-bacteria-effective?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from Tel Aviv University and the Israel Institute for Biological Research have developed the world's first antibiotic-free vaccine that's 100 percent effective in preventing the plague. This mRNA-based single-dose vaccine was tested on mice and protected all vaccinated animals against the disease. Overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Although antibiotics are used to treat the plague, these drugs aren't effective against multiple antibiotic-resistant strains. The researchers are optimistic that their research will help produce safe and effective mRNA antibacterial vaccines for other diseases.
