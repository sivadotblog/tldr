[### Base Power Company (78 minute read)](https://www.notboring.co/p/base-power-company?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The power industry is bottlenecked by the grid - adding more renewables and electrifying more things will only make the grid less stable. The grid is buckling due to the increasing use of variable sources of electricity, decreasing grid reliability, increasing delays in building electrical infrastructure, and increasing demand for electricity. The Base Power Company is trying to fix this problem by deploying connected batteries across the grid. These batteries will store energy for use when needed, reducing strain on the grid.

[### Some cases of Alzheimer's caused by two copies of a single gene (5 minute read)](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/cases-alzheimers-caused-two-copies-single-gene-rcna150909?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have identified a genetic form of late-in-life Alzheimer's disease that occurs in people who inherit two copies of the APOE4 gene. The gene has been associated with the disease as a risk factor for Alzheimer's for years. A recent study suggests that having two copies of the gene is an underlying cause of Alzheimer's rather than just a risk factor. An estimated 15% of Alzheimer's patients carry two copies of APOE4. The gene can make symptoms begin seven to 10 years sooner than in other adults, but it also makes patients more prone to the dangerous side effects of some drug treatments. The discovery allows researchers to develop gene therapy or drugs specifically targeting the gene.

[### Deniable Encryption (27 minute read)](https://ayende.com/blog/200993-C/deniable-encryption?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Deniable encryption is a concept where messages are encrypted in such a way that using a different key would reveal a different message. Theoretically, it allows people to reveal their keys without spilling their secrets. This blog post proposes a method for building a deniable encryption scheme that allows multiple passwords and messages. The full code for the method is provided.

Search and recommendation have traditionally been kept separate, because while they occupy opposite ends of the same spectrum conceptually, they have different tooling, architectures, and machine learning goals. Large language models introduce expectations that need to be managed carefully because it is hard to guide customer intent in an open-ended solution space. This may be frustrating for consumers until specific LLM use cases are sorted out and made less general.

[### LPCAMM2 Is Finally Here, and It's a Big Deal (7 minute read)](https://www.ifixit.com/News/95078/lpcamm2-memory-is-finally-here?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

LPCAMM2 is a totally modular, repairable, and upgradeable memory standard for laptops. It allows consumers to buy laptops and then install more RAM as needed. LPCAMM2 supports the latest LPDDR chips for maximum speed and efficiency. This article presents a teardown of Lenovo's ThinkPad P1 (Gen 7), the first laptop to support LPCAMM2 technology. While the technology is arriving initially in a Lenovo product, it owes its existence to an alliance of tech companies working together over the course of several years.
