[### Boston Dynamics shows off another major leap in humanoid mobility (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/ai-humanoids/boston-dynamics-atlas-athletic/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Boston Dynamics has released a new video (available in the article) that shows its Atlas robot running, cartwheeling, and breakdancing. Atlas' walking now resembles walking rather than taking a bunch of steps - its other movements are starting to look less forced too. The current explosion in humanoid robotics is still at a very early stage, but it is looking clearer than ever that humans and androids will soon be interacting regularly in daily life. Chinese company Unitree has also been doing incredible work with its lightweight G1 humanoid, which has a starting price tag of $16,000.

Jed McCaleb, the serial entrepreneur who founded Mt. Gox and Ripple, has a new company, Vast, that is on track to launch a commercial space station into orbit by May 2026.

Vast is competing with Axiom Space, Voyager Space Holdings, Lockheed Martin, and Blue Origin to win the NASA contract.

[### Accelerating Large-Scale Test Migration with LLMs (7 minute read)](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/accelerating-large-scale-test-migration-with-llms-9565c208023b?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Airbnb recently completed its first large-scale large language model-driven code migration. It updated nearly 3,500 React component test files from Enzyme to use React Testing Library instead.

This blog post looks at the challenges the Airbnb team faced during the migration, how large language models helped solve this particular type of challenge, and how the team structured its tooling to run an AI-driven migration at scale.

[### Apple loses $1B a year on prestigious, minimally viewed Apple TV+ (5 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/apple-tv-reportedly-loses-1-billion-a-year-and-thats-okay-for-now/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Apple TV+ streaming service is losing more than $1 billion annually. The service's subscriber count reached around 45 million in 2024. Apple TV+ typically spends over $5 billion annually on content, but it cut its budget by about $500 million last year. It is reportedly the only part of Apple's services business that is not turning a profit. While its library boasts prestige, its viewership is scant, hindering its ability to make money.
