[### Experimental insulin implant uses electricity to control genes (2 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02461-4?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have generated cells that undergo a chain reaction that ultimately switches on a gene needed to make insulin when stimulated by a small electric current. The researchers implanted the engineered cells into mice and demonstrated that the cells released insulin when a current was applied using electrified acupuncture needles. They hope to adapt the system into wearable medical devices controlled by a computer or smartphone. The same technique could be used to target genetic diseases by implanting cells that deliver crucial proteins.

The next big thing in VR may be an experience augmented by physical sensations that trick senses into mistaking the virtual for reality. Several companies and research teams recently presented next-generation VR technologies at SIGGRAPH, a conference that shows off the latest in VFX, virtual production, and motion capture hardware and software. This article takes a look at some of the technologies presented at the conference, including an experimental VR headset by Meta that physically slides the device's displays closer to users' eyes when they look at closer objects, controllers that can shift their center of gravity, and a new method of simulating the feeling of touch in the fingertips.

[### Are reports of StackOverflow‚Äôs fall greatly exaggerated? (9 minute read)](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/are-reports-of-stackoverflows-fall-exaggerated/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A recent post by a machine learning engineer analyzed Stack Overflow's website data and concluded that the site had lost about 50% of its traffic. The data turned out to not account for a Google Analytics change, which if accounted for would have resulted in a drop of 35%. Stack Overflow says that it has seen an average of around 5% less traffic compared to 2022. Q&A traffic is definitely down. The company has an opportunity to compete against AI by offering tools for companies to utilize its internal knowledge bases.
