SpaceX is looking to add the 2GHz frequency to its Starlink license for use with mobile users. Starlink now has over 2,500 satellites and nearly half a million subscribers. Expanding to the 2GHz frequency would make its signals less affected by obstructing objects and make the service more friendly for smaller devices. Existing Starlink satellites are not capable of providing service to mobiles. SpaceX plans to attach new modules to its satellites and produce a small mobile device for users to connect to on the ground.

[### Low-energy fluidic cells could shade and cool buildings dynamically (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/materials/optofluidic-cells-building-shade-cool/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at the University of Toronto have designed a dynamic shading system inspired by the skin of krill. Krill are usually transparent, but they can move pigments around in the cells beneath their skin to turn darker and protect themselves from UV damage. The shading system is made up of optofluidic cells that can switch between transparent and opaque on demand while using relatively little energy. These cells can act as windows to provide a low-energy temperature regulation system. They could also be used to create large-scale works of art.
