[### TikTok said to be launching live shopping in the US (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/03/tiktok-said-to-be-launching-live-shopping-in-the-us/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

TikTok is in talks with TalkShopLive to provide a live shopping feature on TikTok in the US. The feature will allow creators and brands to sell goods through videos on the platform. Terms of the deal have yet to be finalized and there is no word on when the feature will go live. Tests of the live shopping feature in the UK failed to meet the company's expectations. Facebook recently announced that it was shutting down its live shopping feature to focus on Reels.

[### Apple‚Äôs ad business set to boom on the back of its own anti-tracking crackdown (8 minute read)](https://adguard.com/en/blog/apple-tracking-ads-business.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature wreaked havoc on the global ad market. The feature is projected to cost Meta $12.8 billion this year. It has affected even small businesses, as the cost of acquiring new customers has risen. Advertisers are now spending more money on Apple. The company is expanding its advertising offerings. Its tracking rules only apply to apps that use third-party data to track users, so Apple's native apps are excluded from the policy.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### A bionic pancreas could solve one of the biggest challenges of diabetes (3 minute read)](https://archive.ph/nd5Sj?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A Harvard Medical School team recently tested a bionic pancreas that automatically delivers insulin in a trial with 219 people that have type 1 diabetes. The results of the trial suggest that the device is more effective than pumps or injections at lowering blood glucose levels. The device uses an adaptive learning algorithm to deliver the right dosage of insulin automatically. This feature removes the need for people with diabetes to calculate the amount of carbohydrates they are consuming in a meal.

[### With orbital launch, Firefly takes an early lead in the 1-ton rocket race (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/with-orbital-launch-firefly-takes-an-early-lead-in-the-1-ton-rocket-race/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Firefly recently reached orbit with its Alpha rocket, a rocket capable of lifting one metric ton. The rocket delivered several small payloads into low Earth orbit on Saturday. Firefly has several programs in development, including a lunar lander, a rocket engine that will be used by Northrop Grumman's Antares rocket, and a medium-lift vehicle. The company aims to be able to launch an Alpha rocket every month by 2024. There is significant demand for launch services in the 1-plus ton class.

[### I come bringing good news about hydrogen (10 minute read)](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/i-come-bringing-good-news-about-hydrogen?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While clean hydrogen performs pretty uncompetitively in cars and domestic heating, it can make other things cheaper than ever before. Clean hydrogen could help decarbonize shipping, replace dirty hydrogen in the production of chemicals, and most promisingly, be used for long-term energy storage. Hydrogen appears to be on a learning curve, similar to solar, wind, battery, and electrolyzer technology. Technologies with learning curves tend to win out in the long term due to falling prices and rising capacity.

Automation promises to free humans from mindless, repetitive labor so they can pursue other things. Programmers have been writing code to automate their work for decades. This is mostly done in secret so that their employers are unaware of their gain in free time. Employees who reveal their automation flows to employers usually lose their jobs.
