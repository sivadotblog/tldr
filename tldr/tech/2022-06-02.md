[### Scientists May Have Found a Way to Inject Oxygen Into The Bloodstream Intravenously (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-device-could-intravenously-deliver-oxygen-to-the-bloodstream?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists have found a way to inject oxygen directly into the bloodstream. The new technique works by channeling an oxygen-laden liquid through a series of nozzles that get smaller and smaller. The bubbles end up smaller than red blood cells, so they won't block blood vessels. These bubbles are coated with a lipid membrane before being added to blood. The technique was able to lift blood oxygen saturation levels in mice from 15% to over 95% in just a few minutes. The technique is still a proof of concept and has yet to be tested on people.

The researchers took samples of seagrass shoots from the area and examined genetic markers and found that it was all a single plant. It is estimated to be around 4,500 years old. The giant seagrass meadow appears to be extremely resilient. It can survive in an environment that would be typically highly stressful for most plants.
