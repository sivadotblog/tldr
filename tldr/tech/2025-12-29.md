### Big Tech & Startups

[### The Memory Wars: Why the Future Karpathy, Musk, and Jim Fan See Requires 16-Hi HBM (15 minute read)](https://x.com/benitoz/status/2005349615823183897?s=12&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The infrastructure buildout happening right now may be a sign that the AI chip competition may already be over. Nvidia recently requested 16-Hi HBM deliveries from Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron by Q4 2026. This infrastructure layer could make AI inference effectively infinite and nearly free at the margin. The rollout of capability is arriving faster than our ability to conceptualize what to do with it.

[### Nvidia Groq Update: Everyone Gets Rich, Patent Warfare Begins (7 minute read)](https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/groq-update?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

All of Groq's VCs, employees, founders, and the whole cap table will get paid from the recent acquisition by Nvidia. 85% of the payment will be up front, with the rest coming by the end of 2026. Nvidia will likely weaponize the patents it gained from the acquisition to create a 'scorched-earth zone' around SRAM-based inference. GroqCloud has become a shell of its former self with no IP and no technical leadership.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Proposed Space Station Could Be Deployed in a Single Launch (2 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/proposed-space-station-could-be-deployed-in-a-single-launch-2000701443?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Max Space's Thunderbird is designed to host four astronauts in an expandable interior structure that can be reconfigured by the crew to support different activities. It can be used for research as well as orbital manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and other materials. The space station can be launched on a medium-lift vehicle such as the Falcon 9 rocket. The Thunderbird space station is set to launch as early as 2029.

[### Alzheimer's: from causes and risk factors to models and interventions (14 minute read)](https://nintil.com/alzheimers-cause?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is caused by multiple factors. Each individual factor doesn't necessarily guarantee an AD diagnosis in every situation, but it increases the odds of it all else being equal. Preventing AD and reversing or stopping the disease are two separate areas of research. Attempting to modify risk factors of the disease once it has already started is unlikely to lead to a cure. Targeting the underlying dynamics of the disease is a more likely pathway to a treatment.

[### A Guide to Claude Code 2.0 and Getting Better at Using Coding Agents (55 minute read)](https://sankalp.bearblog.dev/my-experience-with-claude-code-20-and-how-to-get-better-at-using-coding-agents/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Claude Code dominated the CLI coding product experience this year. This guide shows readers the thought processes and simple things to keep in mind to get the most out of Claude Code. Learning how things work in Claude Code directly transfers to other tools, both in terms of personal usage and production-grade engineering. The post will help users keep up with coding agents in general.

[### How I think about Kubernetes (6 minute read)](https://garnaudov.com/writings/how-i-think-about-kubernetes/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Kubernetes is often described as a container orchestration tool, but that mental model isn't always the most useful way to think about what's happening. It is more like a platform where developers declare the desired state of their infrastructure and let the system continuously work to match that intent. In that way, Kubernetes is more like a runtime for declarative infrastructure with a type system. Thinking this way results in very practical approaches to operating clusters.

[### Jevons Paradox for Knowledge Work (7 minute read)](https://x.com/levie/status/2004654686629163154?s=12&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tech-driven efficiency improvements tend to lead to massive growth because there are more use cases for the resources than previously contemplated. AI is going to lead to a lot more knowledge work by making it cheaper, as that allows people to take on tasks previously unimaginable. The vast majority of AI tokens in the future will be used on things that we don't even do today. AI will enable work that previously wouldn't have been considered, as it would have been too expensive or impractical.
