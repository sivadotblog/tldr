[### PayPal Applies to Establish Bank (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/paypal-applies-to-establish-bank-25172927?st=yFGy4k&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

PayPal has filed with the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to establish PayPal Bank. As a Utah-chartered industrial lone company, the bank will be able to lend money, hold FDIC-insured deposits, and be owned by a non-financial institution. The proposed bank would help make PayPal's lending to small businesses more efficient, as it would reduce reliance on third parties. PayPal also plans to offer interest-bearing savings accounts to customers through the proposed bank.

[### Tesla stock closes at 2025 high after Musk confirms driverless Robotaxi tests underway in Austin (5 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/15/tesla-tests-driverless-cars-in-austin-without-humans-on-board.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla is now testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas. The company still hasn't announced when it will be able to operate a ride-hailing service without human safety supervisors or drivers on board. Texas will require authorization from the DMV for commercial use of self-driving vehicles starting in May 2026. California's DMV and Public Utilities Commissions say that Tesla has yet to apply for the permits needed to conduct driverless testing in the state without a human at the wheel, or to operate a commercial robotaxi service.

[### Economics of Orbital vs Terrestrial Data Centers (35 minute read)](https://andrewmccalip.com/space-datacenters?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The economics of putting data centers in space are savage. While it is theoretically possible, it's definitely not a sure thing. Only one company, SpaceX, is positioned to even try due to its vertical integration - having to buy launches, buses, hardware, deployment, and pay margin at every interface will kill any other attempt. While building this infrastructure may be a mediocre trade on strict near-term unit economics, the second-order effects could be enormous.

[### Part 2: Design is a search for the opinions (4 minute read)](https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/2000451411696603437?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The deeper someone gets into a field, the more specific their tools get. Experts don't just use generic items. This applies to software as well. Everything in software is opinionated. The work is in choosing which opinions to embed and where to design something meaningful without dissolving into blandness.
