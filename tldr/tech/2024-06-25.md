[### Responsibility Over Freedom: How Netflix's Culture Has Changed (8 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/business/media/netflix-corporate-culture.html?unlocked_article_code=1.2U0.upEj.EIos50pozWp5&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While Netflix doesn't release a lot of its numbers to the outside world, the streaming giant has long been aggressively transparent internally. Netflix trusts its employees to act in the best interest of the company. Employees are encouraged to speak about what's going well and what's not on a regular basis. Netflix has a culture of trying to systematically think about what generates long-term excellence. Many more details about Netflix's internal culture are available in the article.

The European Commission has opened an investigation into Apple's support for alternative iOS marketplaces in Europe. The investigation is focused on Apple's Core Technology Fee, the multistep process required for users to install third-party marketplaces, and Apple's eligibility requirements for developers. Regulators say that Apple's App Store 'steering' policies violate the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple is the first company to be charged under the DMA rules - it can respond to the European Conformation's preliminary assessment ahead of its final ruling before March 2025. Apple could be fined up to 10% of its annual global revenue for infringement.

Singapore is the only country where cultivated meat can be purchased in shops. The country aims to produce 30% of its nutritional needs locally by 2030. Its approval of cultivated meat has attracted companies from all over the world to develop alternative proteins. Its regulatory structure makes it the perfect spot for companies to further the technology and help drive down costs.

[### World first epilepsy device fitted in UK boy's skull (5 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg33kgd81mvo?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A boy in the UK received a neurostimulator device in his skull to control seizures. The device has reduced his daytime seizures by 80%. The patient has a treatment-resistant form of epilepsy that sometimes causes him to suffer hundreds of seizures every day. He suffers a range of seizures, some of which require emergency medication to resuscitate him. The device, which can be recharged wirelessly, emits a constant pulse of current that aims to block or disrupt abnormal signals. While the device is not a cure, it has improved the patient's life significantly.

[### What are some custom tools you've built/seen internally that has helped your team succeed in automation? (4 minute read)](https://softwareautomation.notion.site/What-are-some-custom-tools-you-ve-built-seen-internally-that-has-helped-your-team-succeed-in-automat-2473acb906b74c0185befb7a0527b781?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

[### The Future of Streaming (28 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/22/technology/netflix-amazon-disney-sony-streaming.html?unlocked_article_code=1.2E0.7QqP.ywQE05OhhoT9&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Stocks of legacy media companies are at a fraction of their former highs, while shares of their disruptors are close to record highs. Netflix commands the leading territory right now and is essentially in a position of dictating policy. Streaming services need at least 200 million subscribers, possibly more, before becoming competitive and profitable. The cost of attracting and keeping those millions of customers isn't cheap - Netflix will spend about $17 billion this year on programming. Almost no other competitor will be able to match that spending level, except maybe Amazon.
