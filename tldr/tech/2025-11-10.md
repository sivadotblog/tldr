[### Tesla is launching a crazy new Rental program with cheap daily rates (4 minute read)](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-launching-crazy-new-rental-program-cheap-daily-rates/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla's in-house Rental program lets people rent vehicles for between three to seven days, starting at $60 per day. It includes free Supercharging and free Full Self-Driving for the duration of the rental. There are no limits on mileage or charging, but renters are not allowed to leave the state from which they rented the vehicle.

[### Apple Plans Major New Satellite-Powered Features for iPhones (17 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-09/apple-iphone-satellite-plans-image-texting-third-party-apps-low-cost-macbook-mhrq10p2?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjczMDQwNywiZXhwIjoxNzYzMzM1MjA3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUdNU0NHUTdMMDUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIwOThFNzNDQTE5QTA0RDkxODEyQzQ4MjcwRDZERTI0QiJ9.ZZ_BnQk7tTplO0ZZCmj8FAqtAG-uv8-Rv-GLIe5QRb4&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is working on new satellite features, including a satellite framework for third-party apps, satellite-powered maps, richer messaging capabilities, 'natural usage' improvements, and satellite over 5G. Bringing most of these new features to market will require major upgrades to Globalstar's satellite infrastructure. SpaceX acquiring Globalstar would force Apple to rethink its business model and long-term strategy for satellite services. However, it could also bring opportunities - Apple could collaborate with SpaceX on premium satellite features.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Riding in a Chinese Robotaxi Is Pretty Smooth—That's a Problem for Waymo (8 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/china-robotaxi-self-driving-waymo-254ce0a1?st=BCZFqE&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Baidu, Pony AI, and WeRide each have hundreds of robotaxis on the road in China operating commercial paid services without a human safety driver. Their technology and rider experience are generally similar to the driverless taxis operated by Waymo in the US. China's robotaxi fleet is projected to grow to tens of thousands of vehicles by the end of next year. The Chinese companies are testing autonomous vehicles in around half a dozen countries - Waymo is only testing its vehicles in one country outside of the US.

[### Genetically Engineered Babies Are Banned. Tech Titans Are Trying to Make One Anyway (20 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/biotech/genetically-engineered-babies-tech-billionaires-6779efc8?st=PwkEK8&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Preventive, a startup backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and his husband, as well as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, is working toward creating genetically engineered human children. Editing gene embryos with the intention of creating babies is banned in the US and many countries, so the company has been searching for places to experiment where the practice is allowed. Preventive is part of a growing number of startups funded by powerful people in Silicon Valley that are pushing the boundaries of fertility and working to commercialize reproductive genetic technologies.

[### Valdi (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Snapchat/Valdi?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework that compiles TypeScript directly to native views on iOS, Android, and macOS. It delivers native performance without sacrificing developer velocity with automatic view recycling, optimized component rendering, an optimized layout engine, and viewport-aware rendering. Valdi eliminates the traditional compile-test-debug cycle that slows native development with instant hot reload, full VSCode debugging, and a familiar syntax. It integrates easily into existing apps and can be scaled as needed.

[### You Need To Become A Full Stack Person (20 minute read)](https://den.dev/blog/full-stack-person/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Work is much messier today than when roles were somewhat rigid and handoffs were clean. Loops are now tighter, and the fast path from idea to impact crosses multiple disciplines. It is now better to have cross-domain fluency along with product sense and engineering craft. AI doesn't lower the cost of choosing the right thing, shaping it well, and operating it in the wild. Models can accelerate execution, but developers still own intent, architecture, and accountability.

China has a million people working on AI 24/7, while the US has maybe 20,000 in Silicon Valley. US export controls are producing precisely the opposite of their intended effects and accelerating China's development. They have triggered a national mobilization. China is predicted to have more AI compute than the rest of the world combined by 2027.
