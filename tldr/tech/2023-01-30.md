[### Apple's Headset Will Reportedly Let Customers Create AR Apps via Siri (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/27/apple-headset-ar-apps-via-siri/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is reportedly developing new tools that will enable both developers and customers to create augmented reality apps for its anticipated AR/VR headset. The tools would allow users to easily create AR apps without the need for coding. Apple already offers some AR creation tools on the iPhone and iPad that could be expanded to the headset. The headset is expected to be released later this year. The software tools for the headset could be revealed at Apple's WWDC in June.

[### OpenAI has hired an army of contractors to make basic coding obsolete (2 minute read)](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/27/2023/openai-has-hired-an-army-of-contractors-to-make-basic-coding-obsolete?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI has hired around 1,000 remote contractors over the past six months from areas such as Latin America and Eastern Europe. Of these contractors, around 60% are responsible for data labeling and the other 40% are programmers creating data for OpenAI's models to learn software engineering tasks. It appears that OpenAI is building a dataset that includes not only lines of code, but also human explanations behind them written in natural language. The company's headcount is currently at 375 people, not including contractors.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### AI has designed bacteria-killing proteins from scratch ‚Äì and they work (2 minute read)](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2356597-ai-has-designed-bacteria-killing-proteins-from-scratch-and-they-work/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An AI-designed anti-microbial protein was tested in real life and shown to work. ProGen works similarly to other AIs that can create text. It was trained on the amino acid structure of 280 million existing proteins. Of the 100 molecules researchers synthesized, 66 reacted in ways that suggest that they could be effective in killing bacteria. The same approach could be used to create new medicines.

[### Smaller, Cheaper Flow Batteries Throw Out Decades-Old Designs (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/flow-battery?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Flow batteries are a promising technology for making solar and wind power a regular part of the grid. They could theoretically be scaled up to megawatt-hours by increasing their tank size. Flow batteries have longer lifetimes and are safer than lithium-ion batteries. However, their capital cost is more than twice that of lithium-ion batteries, making them expensive. Researchers have managed to reduce the size of a flow battery cell by 75 percent by replacing flat electrodes and membranes with wire electrodes and tubular membranes. The new design could decrease the cost of flow-battery power modules by around half.

[### Start coding at the point of least certainty (4 minute read)](https://swizec.com/blog/start-coding-at-the-point-of-least-certainty/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

If there is a risk that a project cannot be done, you should start the project by addressing that risk. Build a quick and dirty prototype of the riskiest part of the project first. It is easy to build a platform, but it would be a waste of time if the actual task can't be accomplished.

[### Mark Zuckerberg reportedly said he doesn't like seeing 'managers managing managers,' fueling speculation of more layoffs (2 minute read)](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-might-cut-metas-middle-management-report-2023-1?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly stated that he is not a fan of multiple layers of management. The company's Chief Product Officer wrote a post earlier this month about the need to 'flatten' the organization's structure. All of this implies that further layoffs are likely. Meta made one of the largest staff reductions in its history in November, laying off more than 11,000 people. It is among the many tech companies that have reduced their workforces in the last few months.

[### Bryan Johnson's Blueprint (9 minute read)](https://nintil.com/bryan-johnson-blueprint/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Bryan Johnson, the founder of Braintree, recently began a program called 'Blueprint' with the goal of slowing down (and potentially reversing) the aging process. Blueprint is a combination of diet, exercise, and supplements that may be beneficial to health and longevity. The evidence behind some of the supplements is not definitive. Johnson has made the entire program open source. People can view Johnson's dietary and exercise habits, as well as his biomarkers and how they have changed over time on the Blueprint website.
