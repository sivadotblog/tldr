Right now, 1 in 10 people worldwide are trying to figure out how to make it through the day without access to clean and safe water. Dirty water makes existing challenges harder than they need to be. It creates cycles of poverty, sickness, and lack of opportunity that ruthlessly repeat for generations.

[### Apple's 'unprecedented' engineering snafu reportedly spoiled plans for more powerful iPhone 14 Pro chip (2 minute read)](https://www.engadget.com/apple-a16-chip-ray-tracing-mistakes-180839937.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple wanted to add a next-generation GPU with support for ray tracing in its A16 Bionic chip but scrapped its plans due to crucial design mistakes late in development. While software simulations suggested that the implementation was feasible, hardware tests showed that the chip drew more power than expected, hurting battery life and overheating the device. Apple then canceled its plans for the chip and opted for one with a similar architecture to the A15 chip used in the iPhone 13 Pro.

[### A New Computer Proof ‚ÄòBlows Up‚Äô Centuries-Old Fluid Equations (4 minute read)](https://archive.ph/Epj7G?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Euler equations describe the flow of an ideal, incompressible fluid. Almost all nonlinear fluid equations are derived from Euler equations, but much remains unknown about them, including whether they're an accurate model of ideal fluid flow. A 177-page proof posted online in October shows that a particular version of the Euler equations does sometimes fail. Other mathematicians have had difficulty verifying the groundbreaking proof as it made significant use of computers, but many experts believe the new work will turn out to be correct.

[### Turn Your Best Programmers into Managers (3 minute read)](https://levelup-edu.com/turn-your-best-programmers-into-managers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Programmers should have the option to progress their careers without leaving the code face. Moving them away from coding can take a huge toll on motivation and morale, especially if they love to code. If they're good at coding, it's better to let them continue coding. Many teams waste a lot of resources relearning the same lessons that experienced coders learned decades ago. There is no reason that a coder shouldn't have an equal say in how a company is run.
