Apple is supposedly getting very close to launching its rumored ring wearable. The company has consistently released smart ring-related patents for several years. A patent from November details a system that lets users control their smartphones and other devices through the use of an external band on the ring. The idea of an Apple smart ring started from rumors in 2007. While the company is apparently considering a launch date for the device, it hasn't indicated how close the launch date will be.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Mind-reading devices are revealing the brain‚Äôs secrets (15 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00481-2?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has allowed scientists to learn lessons about the brain that are overturning assumptions about brain anatomy. BCIs allow scientists to record single-neuron activity for a lot of brain areas that were previously not accessible. They also allow for longer measurements compared to classical tools. Advances in artificial intelligence, decoding tools, and hardware have propelled the field forward. This article discusses some of the findings that BCI technology has enabled.

Mark Zuckerberg says that Meta's finger-tracking neural wristband will ship as a product in the next few years. The wristband uses a technique called electromyography to sense the neural electrical signals passing through users' wrists, potentially providing zero or even negative latency and perfect accuracy, even in poor lighting conditions. The device could enable low-effort precise manipulation in any scenario, similar to a computer mouse but more versatile and with an extra dimension. Videos of the device are available in the article.
