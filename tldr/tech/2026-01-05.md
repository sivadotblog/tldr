Free trials help AI apps grow, but [bots and fake accounts exploit them](https://workos.com/blog/what-is-free-trial-abuse?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q12026). They steal tokens, burn compute, and disrupt real users.

Cursor, the fast-growing AI code assistant, uses [WorkOS Radar](https://workos.com/radar?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q12026) to detect and stop abuse in real time. With device fingerprinting and behavioral signals, Radar blocks fraud before it reaches your app.

[### OpenAI Is Taking On Apple's App Store. It's Got a Long Way to Go (6 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-apple-app-store-sam-altman-7a9b08ca?st=71N4m8&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is aiming to create an app store that rivals Apple's, but early tests suggest that the company still has a long way to go. ChatGPT's more than 800 million users can now perform various tasks, such as order groceries from Instacart or create a playlist with Spotify, using ChatGPT instead of opening an app. However, the current system requires too many extra steps, making it more complicated to use than traditional apps. Also, many ChatGPT apps only have very basic functionality, steering users back to more capable apps or sites.

The peptide scene exposes regulatory theater, economic desperation, and a philosophical tension about bodily autonomy. While there is some evidence that these compounds work, people are taking on a lot of risk by using untested substances on themselves. The peptide gray market has matured, making it likely unregulatable. This article looks at some of the peptides available on the market and the evidence behind their effectiveness.

Boris Cherny created Claude Code. In this thread, he details his setup and how he works with Claude Code. Claude Code was created to be very customizable, but Cherny uses a surprisingly vanilla setup. Each person on the Claude Code team uses the IDE very differently.

[### The disappearing middle of software work (3 minute read)](https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/2007534281011155419?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The center of software work is moving. Previously, the model of software work - turning intent into something real - absorbed most of the time, attention, and craft of software teams. AI agents can now produce working code from goals, context, and tasks. As systems improve, the middle will get thinner, and less time will be spent manually translating intent into implementation. Developers will still need to understand the problem, gather the right context from customers and internal teams, and shape the work. Directing and managing agent work will become the craft in this era.

[### My thoughts on Waterloo's co-op program (7 minute read)](https://nicholaschen.me/blogs/waterloo-coop?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The University of Waterloo has a co-op program that is famous for the opportunities offered and the different countries you could work in. All of the students in every graduating class always have jobs lined up due to the over two years of work experience they gained in the program. This post, written by a student who has been in the co-op for a bit longer than a year, discusses how the program has changed them and helped them. While the program gives students a massive head start on their careers, financial independence, and the chance to live in a new city every four months, it creates a lot of pressure, and students are forced to grow up fast.
