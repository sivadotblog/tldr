Kidney cells housed within the Kidney Project's bioreactor can survive inside the body of a pig and mimic several important kidney functions for at least one week. The Kidney Project aims to create a device that can improve on dialysis. A bioartificial kidney would make treatments for kidney disease more effective, tolerable, and comfortable.

[### Mustafa Suleyman on getting Washington and Silicon Valley to tame AI (55 minute read)](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/mustafa-suleyman-getting-washington-and-silicon-valley-to-tame-ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This page contains highlights from an hour-long podcast with Mustafa Suleyman, one of the three co-founders of DeepMind, where he discusses ways to limit the negative and unforeseen consequences of emerging technologies and many other AI-related topics. Suleyman thinks that AI and biotechnology will soon enable small groups to cause harm on previously unimaginable scales.

This may become a legitimate concern within the next 12 years.
