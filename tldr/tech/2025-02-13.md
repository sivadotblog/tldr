[### The missing tier for query compilers (17 minute read)](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/the-missing-tier-for-query-compilers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

These days, a cheap NVME SSD can supply data much faster than a query interpreter can process it. Depending on the query, removing the interpreter bottleneck can yield several orders of magnitude speedup. The article looks at different options for compiling queries and their pros and cons. Queries might only be run once, so it's only worth spending time on optimization at compile-time if doing so will save even more time at runtime.

[### Understanding the trade-offs of using Tailwind CSS (12 minute read)](https://measured.co/blog/tailwind-trade-offs?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article explores the benefits and trade-offs of building web pages with Tailwind. Tailwind is a CSS framework that uses a utility-first approach that involves styling elements directly without needing to leave HTML. It promises developers the ability to build modern web pages quickly and simply, but there can be significant impacts on maintenance and scaling. Tailwind's utility-first approach can work well for small-to-medium projects where speed and cost-efficiency are top priorities, but for larger projects or teams with established CSS practices, it introduces challenges around readability, maintainability, and scalability.

[### The Economics of Being a Founding Engineer (6 minute read)](https://www.greptile.com/blog/founding-engineer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Working at a large technology company has been an excellent financial decision for technically capable people over the last few years. Joining a rocketship startup - at the right time - can also be an excellent decision. Early-career cash pay at YC startups is often similar to big tech firms. Founding engineers can receive equity that, vested over four years, could potentially be not too different from an offer from Facebook. The median startup fails, making the equity worthless, but there is the potential for extraordinary returns. Being a founding engineer essentially means taking a pay cut and accepting illiquid equity in exchange for a lottery ticket - it's a high-stakes game of calculated risk-taking where due diligence can help tilt the odds in your favor.
