[### Microsoft Cracks Down On Low Performers With New Exit Strategy: Check Details (3 minute read)](https://in.mashable.com/tech/93024/microsoft-cracks-down-on-low-performers-with-new-exit-strategy-check-details?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft has rolled out stricter internal policies to reinforce its performance management system. The new guidelines help managers address underperformance more decisively while rewarding high achievers more clearly. Changes include a tougher exit policy for employees consistently rated in the lowest performance bracket and the introduction of performance-related tools aimed at increasing transparency and consistency in evaluations and rewards. Microsoft is developing AI-powered training tools that simulate real-life feedback scenarios to help improve confidence and communication during performance discussions.

[### OpenAI wants to buy Chrome and make it an ‚ÄúAI-first‚Äù experience (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/chatgpt-head-tells-court-openai-is-interested-in-buying-chrome/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

When asked if OpenAI would join in the bidding if Google had to sell Chrome, OpenAI's head of product for ChatGPT Nick Turley said unequivocally that the company would. OpenAI has reportedly been considering building its own Chromium-based browser to compete with Chrome. Having a browser would give OpenAI a massive install base of users and the user data flowing through the browser would be invaluable in training agentic AI models that can operate browsers on users' behalf. There's a lot of discussion about who should buy Chrome, but relatively little about spinning it off into an independent company - despite Google's claims, the existence of its multibillion-dollar search placement deals indicates the browser can survive on its own.

Earlier this month, an international crew of four private astronauts took a journey into space aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. Chun Wang, a Chinese-born cryptocurrency billionaire, paid SpaceX an undisclosed sum for the mission to fly into orbit with three of his friends. The mission was named Fram2 after the Norwegian exploration ship Fram used for polar expeditions at the turn of the 20th century. It orbited over Earth's pole for a perspective on the planet that no human eyes had seen before. This article details what happened on the mission - footage from the mission is available.

Lab-grown chocolate could rival traditional chocolate in several ways. The process can grow cells that multiply swiftly and mature within a week, as opposed to the six to eight months usually required for a conventional cocoa crop. The resulting product can also contain higher levels of health-promoting chemicals and fewer contaminants such as heavy metals or pesticides. The price of cocoa is skyrocketing as the industry deals with drought and other problems.

[### The Future of Compute: NVIDIA's Crown is Slipping (30 minute read)](https://mohitdagarwal.substack.com/p/from-dominance-to-dilemma-nvidia?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia has become the fastest-scaling hardware company in history, and with an immediate lack of alternatives, it will continue to print cash. However, the company's long-term durability may be affected by hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta developing competitive, highly-credible chip efforts. The sheer scale of compute needs is driving an enormous shift towards distributed, vertically-integrated, and co-optimized systems. This means that even though Nvidia has the highest-performing GPUs, it can still lose.
