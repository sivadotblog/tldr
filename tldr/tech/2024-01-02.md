Many teams at Amazon have been in a hiring freeze for over a year and the employees that were left after the layoffs in 2023 are now leaving. The changes in the organization will likely result in a major AWS outage in 2024. There has already been an increase in large-scale events throughout Amazon. While Amazon is operationally strong, these operational practices depend on people, and when people are eliminated to increase stock prices, operational practices suffer.

Scientists have discovered a way to combat cancer cells using vibrating molecules. The molecules vibrate synchronously to rupture the membranes of cancer cells. They are activated with near-infrared light, which allows for deeper penetration into the body than visible light. The technique demonstrated 99% efficacy in destroying cultured cancer cells in laboratory tests. When tested on mice models, half of the animals became cancer-free.
