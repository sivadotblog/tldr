### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists Actually Did It: They Built a Real Working Tractor Beam (2 minute read)](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a42676079/scientists-build-working-tractor-beam/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese scientists have developed the first-ever tractor beam that is strong enough to move macroscopic objects. In their experiments, they demonstrated that it is possible to use flexible light manipulation on macroscopic objects by controlling the interactions between the light, object, and medium. The experiments were conducted in a highly controlled lab that had a rarefied gaseous environment with a lower pressure than Earth's atmosphere. The technique provides a non-contact and long-distance pulling approach that could be useful for various scientific experiments.

[### Precision Neuroscience, co-founded by Neuralink alum, is creating a brain implant thinner than a human hair (4 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/25/capoot-precision-neuroscience-12523.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Precision Neuroscience's Layer 7 Cortical Interface is a brain implant that aims to help patients with paralysis operate digital devices using neural signals. The Layer 7 is an electrode array that resembles a piece of scotch tape and is thinner than a human hair. Implanting the device requires a surgical procedure to create a slit less than a millimeter wide in the skull. As the device isn't inserted directly into the brain tissue, the resolution of the brain signals is not as strong as it is in some other similar devices. The device has been successfully used to decode brain signals in animals.

Infrastructure code deployments often fail due to mismatched constraints over resource fields between the infrastructure code, the deployment engine, and the target cloud. precloud is a command line interface that contains rules that check for names, quotas, and resource-specific constraints to make sure that infrastructure code is deployed successfully. It can be used to harden deployments, enforce organizational resource patterns, and maintain security standards.
