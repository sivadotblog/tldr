### Big Tech & Startups

[### Meta tried to buy Ilya Sutskever's $32 billion AI startup, but is now planning to hire its CEO (4 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/19/meta-tried-to-buy-safe-superintelligence-hired-ceo-daniel-gross.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mark Zuckerberg's AI hiring spree has now turned to Daniel Gross, the CEO of Ilya Sutskever's startup Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. Meta tried to acquire Safe Superintelligence earlier this year, but its efforts were rebuffed. Zuckerberg started negotiating with Gross soon after those talks ended. Both Gross and Friedman will join Meta and work on products under Alexandr Wang. Meta will get a stake in NFDG, a venture capital firm run by Gross and Friedman.

[### Elon Musk's X to offer investment and trading in ‚Äòsuper app' push (4 minute read)](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/topstories/elon-musk-s-x-to-offer-investment-and-trading-in-super-app-push/ar-AA1H1N63?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

X users will soon be able to make investments and trades on the social media platform. The company is also exploring the introduction of an X credit or debit card. Elon Musk aims to change X into an 'everything app' - a one-stop shop for messaging, payments, and shopping. X Money, a digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment service, is launching later this year. The push into financial services will open X up to regulatory challenges, such as compliance with licensing and money laundering regulations.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### SpaceX's next Starship just blew up on its test stand in South Texas (14 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/starships-rough-year-gets-worse-after-a-late-night-explosion-in-south-texas/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during a ground test late Wednesday. The explosion destroyed the upper stage that was slated to launch on the next Starship test flight. Preliminary data suggests that the incident was caused by the failure of a high-pressure nitrogen tank inside Starship's payload bay. SpaceX had set June 29 as a tentative launch date for the next Starship test flight, but that won't happen now. The extent of the damage at the site is unclear, so it is unknown how long the test site will be out of commission. Videos of the explosion are available in the article.

[### FDA approves powerful HIV drug that nearly eliminated spread in clinical trials (10 minute read)](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-hiv-prevention-drug-prep-lenacapavir-rcna208387?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved a new HIV-prevention medication called Yeztugo. The drug nearly eliminated the spread of HIV in clinical trials. It is the first in a new class of antiretrovirals that block HIV from infecting and making new copies of itself inside the immune cells it targets. It costs $14,109 per injection, so health insurers will likely decline to cover the treatment in favor of other forms of PrEP, which can cost as little as $30 per month.

[### The Brute Squad (27 minute read)](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-brute-squad?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Software development tools are getting killed off and replaced by agentic coding. The typical agentic coding workflow doesn't involve using traditional IDEs - it is console-based. This lets developers work faster, be more ambitious, and have more fun. Developers should start learning how to use these tools or start thinking about other career options.

[### What Would a Kubernetes 2.0 Look Like (27 minute read)](https://matduggan.com/what-would-a-kubernetes-2-0-look-like/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Kubernetes is a massive force multiplier, but it has a steep learning curve. A decade after its release, there is still a lot of churn inside the ecosystem and people stepping on well-documented landmines. This post looks at what can be added to Kubernetes to make the great tool even more applicable to more people and problems.

[### I feel open source has turned into two worlds (2 minute read)](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/OpenSourceTwoWorlds?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There's an increasingly sharp distinction between corporate use of open source software and people's cooperative use of it. While open source licenses allow corporate use of open source software, it is qualitatively different than the personal cooperative sphere of open source. This means that the social rules are different. Existing open source licenses, practices, and culture don't draw this distinction. The current system for corporate use of open source is an increasingly bad deal for the open source people involved.

[### Can A.I. Quicken the Pace of Math Discovery? (9 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/19/science/math-ai-darpa.html?unlocked_article_code=1.QU8.ZxwT.rsTb6HHqJgEf&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

DARPA is enlisting researchers to find out ways to conduct high-level mathematics research with an AI 'co-author'. It has created a grant-making program called Exponentiating Mathematics to speed up to pace of progress in pure math. Pure math is a domain where visionary theoreticians make audacious observations about how the world works. Progress in the field can take decades or centuries to solve.
