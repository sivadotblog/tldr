[### Google reveals Nano Banana 2 AI image model, coming to Gemini today (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/google-releases-nano-banana-2-ai-image-generator-promises-pro-results-with-flash-speed/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nano Banana 2, also known as Gemini 3.1 Flash Image, delivers results similar to Nano Banana Pro but with the speed of the non-pro Flash variant. The new image generator has more advanced world knowledge, which gives it the necessary information to render objects with greater fidelity and create more accurate infographics. Nano Banana 2 will replace both the standard and Pro variants of Nano Banana across the Gemini app, Search, AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Flow. Example images generated with the model are available in the article.

[### Tomorrow's Smart Pills Will Deliver Drugs and Take Biopsies (11 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ingestible-electronics?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Doctors may soon prescribe pills that can travel through the digestive system and check for tissue health. Diagnosis for gastrointestinal diseases is often complicated, and treatment can bring serious side effects. Capsules are able to handle much of that work and could even release drugs exactly where they're needed or snip biopsy samples for analysis. The technology could transform care and make screening for disease less invasive and more accessible.

[### What Claude Code Actually Chooses (3 minute read)](https://amplifying.ai/research/claude-code-picks?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

As more developers let Claude Code handle tool selection, the stacks that the AI chooses become 'the stack'. The model's training data may shape market share more than a marketing budget or conference talk. This study looks at what tools Claude Code actually picks. Claude Code would rather build from scratch than use existing tools - custom implementations are its single most common recommendation.

[### Open Source in the age of AI (3 minute read)](https://john.onolan.org/open-source-in-the-age-of-ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The dynamics of the software industry are rapidly changing. Some of the foundations that open source was built on are looking increasingly shaky. Open source maintainers have been fighting companies taking their work and creating competing products for years by using increasingly restrictive licenses or keeping certain parts of the development stack private. However, AI is making it easier to clone codebases into entirely new products. Software licenses may become meaningless as AI becomes adept enough to rewrite open source codebases from scratch without using any of the original code.

[### Anthropic CEO Amodei says Pentagon's threats ‘do not change our position' on AI (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/26/anthropic-pentagon-ai-amodei.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, says that the company cannot, in good conscience, agree to allow the Department of Defense to use its AI models in all lawful use cases without limitations. The Department of Defense wants to be able to use Anthropic's models without restrictions on fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance. Anthropic has refused to change its stance despite threats by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to label it as a 'supply chain risk' or invoke the Defense Production Act to force it to comply with the department's demands. Discussions between the two parties are still ongoing.
