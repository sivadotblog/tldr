[### Nintendo‚Äôs Switch successor is already in third-party devs‚Äô hands, report claims (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/report-nintendos-next-console-ships-late-2024-still-supports-cartridges/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nintendo is planning to launch its next console in the second half of 2024. Development hardware for the console is already in some third-party developers' hands. The console will be usable in a portable mode, just like its predecessor, but it will likely go with an LCD screen to keep costs down. There is a need to keep costs down due to other internal upgrades. The device will have a cartridge slot. It is unclear whether the device will feature backward compatibility with Switch games.

[### Viral room-temperature superconductor claims spark excitement ‚Äì and skepticism (3 minute read)](https://theconversation.com/viral-room-temperature-superconductor-claims-spark-excitement-and-skepticism-210700?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A claim by a group of South Korean physicists last week may open up a new era for humankind. The team created a purportedly room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor. Such a material could have huge implications for energy generation and transmission, transport, computing, and other technologies. There are now several efforts to replicate the work. This article explains the finding, why it is so significant, the controversies around the studies' publication, and the process that the papers need to go through before the findings are verified.

[### SpaceX tested ‚Äòmega-steel pancake‚Äô water deluge system for Starship (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/31/spacex-tested-mega-steel-pancake-water-deluge-system-for-starship/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX ran a full-pressure test for its new water deluge system for Starship on Friday. The previous system was not able to handle the orbital flight test in April and the launch pad ended up as a crater. The new system is composed of a very thick perforated steel plate and multiple huge water jets that continually cool it with water. It is unclear how much water is discharged during a full-pressure spray or whether SpaceX will have to apply for an environmental permit for disposing of industrial process wastewater.

[### Tesla created secret team to suppress thousands of driving range complaints (20 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-batteries-range/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many Tesla drivers have reported getting much less driving range than expected. However, when booking in for a service, Tesla employees would tell them that remote diagnostics indicated their batteries were fine and their bookings were refused. Tesla had deployed a team instructed to thwart customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service as its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners with the same issue. The company had reportedly inflated its in-dash range-meter projections as a lack of range is a primary obstacle for customers looking to purchase an electric vehicle.

[### SEC Reportedly Asked Coinbase to Halt All Trading‚ÄîExcept for Bitcoin (2 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/sec-asked-coinbase-to-halt-trading-except-for-bitcoin-1850691411?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Coinbase accuses the exchange of trading 13 cryptocurrencies identified as securities and operating as an unregistered securities exchange. It alleges that Coinbase is failing to protect its users with regulatory inspections, required record keeping, and protections against conflicts of interest. The SEC says that Coinbase‚Äôs staking program is also an unregistered security. The lawsuit did not include a formal request for companies to delist crypto assets. Coinbase‚Äôs CEO Brian Armstrong opted to handle the matter in court as complying would have meant the end of the crypto industry in the US.
