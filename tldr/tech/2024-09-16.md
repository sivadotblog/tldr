[### SpaceX Polaris Dawn crew returns home after history-making mission (4 minute read)](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/15/science/spacex-polaris-dawn-splashdown-landing/index.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

[### TikTok is about to get its day in court (11 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/14/24243794/tiktok-ban-bytedance-court-oral-arguments-lawsuit-explainer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

On September 16, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will hear oral arguments for TikTok's First Amendment challenge to legislation that it claims amounts to a ban. The US government argues that TikTok is a clear national security threat but says that revealing why would be a threat. Its claims rely on dozens of pages of redacted classified material that likely focus on the potential that the Chinese government could compel ByteDance to hand over the data of US users or push specific content onto US users. These risks are reportedly so significant that they override TikTok's First Amendment claims.

The results from a landmark pair of major clinical trials of lenacapavir, an injectable HIV-prevention drug that only requires dosing every six months, show that it is 89% more effective at preventing HIV than daily oral preventative medication among gay, bisexual, and transgender people. It could be a game changer if rolled out broadly and equitably, but the drug is extraordinarily expensive. Its current list price for use as an HIV treatment is $3,450 per month. It is unclear whether it will have a different list price for use as a preventive.
