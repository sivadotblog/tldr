[### iOS 17 to Support App Sideloading to Comply With European Regulations (1 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

iPhone users will be able to download apps outside of the official App Store in iOS 17. The change will mean that developers will no longer have to pay Apple's 15-30% fees. The EU's Digital Markets Act requires gatekeeper companies to open up their services and platforms to other companies and developers. The law will have a big impact on Apple's platforms. Apple has previously claimed that sideloading apps will create privacy and security issues for users. The company must comply with the new law or risk fines of as much as 20% of its global revenue.

[### OpenAI‚Äôs CEO Says the Age of Giant AI Models Is Already Over (3 minute read)](https://archive.ph/CJyMw?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that the research strategy that birthed ChatGPT is played out and that further progress will not come from making models bigger. There are diminishing returns on scaling up model size and physical limits on how many data centers the company can build and maintain. It is unclear what research strategies or techniques OpenAI will use instead for its next-generation models. New model designs, architectures, and further tuning based on human feedback are promising directions that many researchers are already exploring.

[### The Future of Fertility (35 minute read)](https://archive.ph/QQ9vr?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Some scientists believe that sex may no longer be the method by which most people will make babies within the next few decades. While life expectancy has increased over the century, the age at which women lose their fertility has stayed the same. As populations are aging and fewer people are having children at a young age, most countries can no longer take a passive approach to fertility issues. This article takes a deep look at a technology called in-vitro gametogenesis which can create gametes outside of the body using non-reproductive cells.

AI technology can now create convincing copies of people's voices and music. This article explores the value of music when anyone can just use someone else's voice. Stars in the future may be able to license their voice and likenesses for people to use in their creations. The value in many songs is that it comes from the artist - it's not all about the music. Keeping track of user-generated content will be a major issue for platforms like YouTube in the coming years.

The Free Software Foundation says that Google's decision to remove support for JPEG XL is a sign of the disturbing amount of control the company has over browsers and the web. JPEG XL was introduced as an experimental feature in Chrome version 91 and removed in version 110. Widespread adoption of the format could have resulted in an estimated 25-30% reduction in global bandwidth, but many companies didn't want to adopt it as they had their own standards they wanted to use.
