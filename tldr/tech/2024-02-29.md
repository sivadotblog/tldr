[### Elon Musk‚Äôs bold claim: Tesla‚Äôs Roadster to hit 0-60 mph in less than one second (4 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/transportation/elon-musks-bold-claim-teslas-roadster-to-hit-0-60-mph-in-less-than-one-second?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk claims that the Tesla Roadster, which he plans to unveil by the end of 2024, can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in less than a second. The current record holder for a production car's fastest 0-60 mph is the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170, which can do it in 1.66 seconds. If Musk's claims are true, the Tesla Roadster will be faster than the speed of sound. Tesla aims to ship the car in 2025, four years after its original 2020 target.

The tool isn't available to the public yet and no release date has been announced.

[### Apple Spent More Than $10 Billion on Apple Car Before Canceling Project (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-car-10-billion-spent/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple spent more than $10 billion working on the Apple Car since the project first launched in 2014. The money was spent on research and development, with thousands of engineers and car experts working on the project. Apple was never able to find the right leader for the project - the project had four different leads over its course of 10 years. Most of the more than 2,000 employees who worked on the car project will be redistributed, while some will be laid off. Apple will apply its learnings from the car project to other devices.
