[### Blue Origin makes a big lunar announcement without any fanfare (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/blue-origin-makes-a-big-lunar-announcement-without-any-fanfare/?uuid=JUzM2vRCCytYNO7g2752?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Blue Origin's 'Blue Alchemist' program has created solar cells and electricity transmission wires from simulated lunar soil. Simulated lunar soil is a material that is chemically and mineralogically equivalent to lunar regolith. The solar cells and wires were created using an engineering process called 'Molten Regolith Electrolysis', a technique that can also be used to produce metals for construction, oxygen, and other resources. Blue Origin hopes to market the technology to NASA for use in the Artemis program.

[### Swallowing this pill-shaped sensor could help you avoid invasive procedures (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/13/swallowing-this-pill-shaped-sensor-could-help-you-avoid-invasive-procedures/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team from Caltech and MIT have developed a new pill-shaped ingestible module containing sensors. The module‚Äôs progression through the GI tract can be monitored using electromagnetic fields generated from an external coil. It has been tested in large non-human animals where the accuracy of the system was within 5 to 10 millimeters. Potential applications of the technology include the early identification of constipation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and gastroparesis. The system can be used at home without needing to go to a doctor or hospital.
