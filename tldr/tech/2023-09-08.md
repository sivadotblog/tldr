Cruise, a company backed by GM, is set to soon begin mass production of its fully autonomous vehicle, pending regulatory approval. The vehicle will not have a steering wheel or pedals. Its lack of traditional human controls means that Cruise requires an exemption from the federal government's motor vehicle safety standards. The government body responsible for processing the exemption is expected to make a decision on the matter soon, maybe even before the end of the month.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists grow whole model of human embryo, without sperm or egg (5 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-66715669?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists from the Weizmann Institute have grown embryo models that resemble real early human embryos without using sperm, eggs, or a womb. The embryo models look like a textbook example of a real 14-day-old embryo. They release hormones that turn pregnancy tests positive in the lab. Realistic embryo models could provide an ethical way for scientists to study the earliest moments of life. The scientists claim that it would be impossible to achieve a real pregnancy using their embryo models.

Researchers have created human-pig chimeric embryos that, when transferred to surrogate pig mothers, were shown to have kidneys that contained mostly human cells. This is the first time that scientists have grown a solid humanised organ inside another animal. The kidneys are not able to be used for transplantation in their current form as they are not entirely human. There are still plenty of legal and ethical challenges to overcome before this work will see any clinical applications.

ŒºDSV is a JavaScript library for parsing well-formed CSV strings. It is mostly RFC 4180 compliant. ŒºDSV supports quoted values containing commas, escaped quotes, and line breaks. It will eventually be able to handle 99.5% of use cases without adding complexity or performance trade-offs to support the remaining 0.5%.
