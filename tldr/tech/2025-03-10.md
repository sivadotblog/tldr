[### Manus, a New AI Agent From China is Going Viral‚ÄîAnd Raising Big Questions (4 minute read)](https://www.maginative.com/article/manus-a-new-ai-agent-from-china-is-going-viral-and-raising-big-questions/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Manus is an autonomous agent that can analyze, plan, and execute tasks on its own. It is currently only accessible through invitation codes, which are in short supply - demand is through the roof as the AI community is raving about its capabilities. Many are now asking whether China has leapfrogged the US in AI. Manus likely achieved its impressive capabilities through innovative fine-tuning rather than core model innovation. A video introducing Manus is available in the article.

[### Apple Delays Siri Upgrade Indefinitely as AI Concerns Escalate (4 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-07/apple-confirms-delay-of-ai-infused-personalized-siri-assistant?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MTU1NzQwMywiZXhwIjoxNzQyMTYyMjAzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTU1JNOVVEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFQTExNDNDNTM4NEE0RUY5QTg5RjJEN0IxMTg2MzcwOSJ9.r0spdPdq9dwFBPLKp66cUfi8NWSVnf1Do-1_4PpNyr0&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is delaying updates to Siri for the foreseeable future. The company's engineers believe that the features introduced last June won't be released until next year at the earliest. Several executives have voiced strong concerns as the features didn't work as advertised in their personal testing. Apple may have to rebuild the features from scratch.

[### Starship Flight 8: SpaceX nails Super Heavy booster catch but loses upper stage (3 minute read)](https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-starship-flight-8-results-super-heavy-booster-catch-video/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX's eight Starship test flight last Thursday aimed for the third successful booster recovery and the deployment of a satellite simulator. While the Super Heavy booster returned successfully to Starbase's launch tower, the mission's upper stage disintegrated during its flight. SpaceX has been reviewing the data from the flight to better understand the incident's root cause. Video of the explosion is available in the article.

[### Natural alternative to Ozempic brings results without side effects (3 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/disease/obesity/brp-natural-alternative-ozempic/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Stanford scientists have identified a naturally occurring molecule that works like semaglutide, producing weight loss and improved glucose and insulin tolerance, when tested in mice and minipigs. The peptide, named BRP, only works in the brain, as opposed to semaglutide, which has widespread effects. It specifically acts in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism, which could be an improvement over semaglutide. The scientists intend to move to human clinical trials for BRP.

[### Microsoft's Relationship With OpenAI Is Not Looking Good (3 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/microsofts-relationship-with-openai-is-not-looking-good-2000573293?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

More evidence has surfaced that Microsoft is looking to split with OpenAI. Microsoft is developing its own in-house reasoning models and has been testing models from xAI, Meta, and DeepSeek to replace ChatGPT in Copilot. Copilot has so far been received poorly in enterprise due to its high cost and limited results. OpenAI and Microsoft are quickly becoming competitors, so it makes sense that the companies would want to detach from each other. Microsoft has an interest in controlling the technologies and writing its own destiny.

[### Meta Takes Another Hit After Reports That It Blacklists Ex-Employees (6 minute read)](https://www.inc.com/bruce-crumley/meta-takes-another-hit-after-reports-that-it-blacklists-ex-employees/91157853?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta reportedly maintains a de facto blacklist of ex-employees - even some former workers with sterling track records have been blocked. The company uses multiple systems to track rehire ineligibility, but the exact mechanisms and number of affected employees are unclear. While the blacklist may not sit well with outsiders, it is not illegal. The routine banishment of ex-workers isn't exclusive to Meta, with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and many other companies purportedly maintaining similar lists.
