[### Meta and AMD Agree to AI Chips Deal Worth More Than $100 Billion (4 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-and-amd-agree-to-ai-chips-deal-worth-more-than-100-billion-9c7fd06b?st=npusxH&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta has agreed to buy 6 gigawatts' worth of AI computing power from AMD in a deal valued at more than $100 billion. AMD has agreed to give Meta warrants to buy up to 160 million AMD shares, roughly 10% of the company, for $0.01 apiece, as long as certain milestones are met. Meta said last week that it would buy several million of Nvidia's GPUs as well, a deal expected to cost tens of billions of dollars. The company plans to deploy tens of gigawatts of data center computing power this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time.

[### Pentagon Gives Anthropic Ultimatum and Deadline in AI Use Standoff (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/pentagon-gives-anthropic-ultimatum-and-deadline-in-ai-use-standoff-40915a8a?st=5SCfby&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthropic has until Friday to comply with the Pentagon's demands to use its AI models for all lawful use cases, including mass domestic surveillance or autonomous weapons, which Anthropic doesn't allow its models to be used for. Failing to comply will mean the cancellation of Anthropic's contract. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said he could also label the company a supply-chain risk or invoke the Defense Production Act to essentially force Anthropic to work more collaboratively with the Pentagon. Designating a company as a supply-chain risk would mean that businesses working with the Pentagon would have to certify that they don't use Anthropic's models in any of their work with the military.

[### Google moonshot spinoff looks to ship city-scale laser Internet (4 minute read)](https://www.thestack.technology/google-moonshot-spinoff-looks-to-ship-the-internet-as-light/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Taara, a Google moonshot spin-off, plans to create urban data highways made out of light. Taara Photonics is a wireless communication platform based on optical phased arrays. The Taara Beam transmits data wirelessly with Class 1M eye-safe lasers in the unlicensed infrared band 193 THz. It can support speeds of up to 25 Gbps over a claimed range of up to 10 kilometers. The Taara Lightbridge Pro can do double that distance.

[### Data centers are racing to space — and regulation can't keep up (5 minute read)](https://restofworld.org/2026/orbital-data-centers-ai-sovereignty/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Over the past month, six American companies and a Chinese firm have expressed interest in building data centers in space. Experts warn that the projects could open governance loopholes, especially for countries with little say in how they are run. Orbital data centers could place critical infrastructure beyond regulatory reach for many developing countries and deepen digital dependence. New frameworks need to be built to prevent orbital compute from becoming an extension of existing terrestrial monopolies.

[### Tech Firms Aren't Just Encouraging Their Workers to Use AI. They're Enforcing It (8 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/tech-firms-arent-just-encouraging-their-workers-to-use-ai-theyre-enforcing-it-d43ebf84?st=tC5Bx3&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Some tech firms have started tracking their workers' use of AI tools with an eye on productivity gains, and in certain cases, factoring it into performance reviews. There are jobs that aren't even considering candidates unless they demonstrate AI fluency. AI adoption hasn't been easy, as tech workers have many of the same feelings about AI as the broader population, including skepticism about how much time it is actually saving them. There's also the added anxiety about adopting a technology that will cause them to eventually lose their jobs.
