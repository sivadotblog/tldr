[### Figma's journey to TypeScript (20 minute read)](https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-journey-to-typescript-compiling-away-our-custom-programming-language/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article discusses how the team at Figma automatically migrated Skew, a custom programming language, to TypeScript without disrupting a single day of development. Figma created Skew to squeeze additional performance out of its playback engine. Using Skew made it difficult to onramp new hires.
