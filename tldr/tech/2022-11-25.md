[### Semaglutidonomics (15 minute read)](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/semaglutidonomics?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Semaglutide is a weight loss medication that causes people to lose more weight than any safe drug has ever caused people to lose before. At $15,000 per year, if only a quarter of the obese population got the drug, it would cost almost twice as much as all other drug spending in the US combined. This article looks at why so few people are using the drug and whether that will change. People are unaware of the drug and it has high costs, but the introduction of competing drugs and other factors will make it more affordable in the future.

[### New CRISPR-based tool inserts large DNA sequences at desired sites in cells (5 minute read)](https://news.mit.edu/2022/crispr-gene-editing-dna-1124?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

MIT researchers have designed a new tool that can cut and replace genes safelt and efficiently. PASTE (Programmable Addition via Site-specific Targeting Elements) can deliver genes as long as 36,000 DNA base pairs to several types of human cells. It works by combining the precise targeting of CRISPR-Cas9 with enzymes that viruses use to insert genetic material into bacterial genomes. In tests, the researchers were able to insert genes with a success rate ranging from 5% to 60% with very few unwanted changes.

The deal is also being investigated in the EU and UK.

[### We could run out of data to train AI language programs (3 minute read)](https://archive.ph/YL3wK?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team of AI forecasters say that we might run out of data to train models on as early as 2026. More data is needed as models become more powerful and develop greater capabilities. These models require text that is often produced by professional writers. Data shortages may push AI researchers to use lower quality text or train models on the same dataset multiple times.
