Android's Quick Share now works with Apple's AirDrop system. Apple devices will now appear in the Quick Share interface on Android, and Android devices will appear on macOS devices. The two-way sharing works for photos, videos, and other files. The connection is direct and peer-to-peer - data is never routed through a server, and shared content is never logged.

[### Glass, Not Ice (20 minute read)](https://www.untillabs.com/blog/glass-not-ice?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cryopreservation is a technology that brings tissue into a temporary glassy state to pause biological time so that patients can have more time. It is used in IVF and to help people recover from chemotherapy through hematopoietic stem cell transplants. The technology uses controlled-rate freezers, perfusion systems, novel cryoprotectants, and rewarming devices to preserve complex biological systems. The field is aiming for whole-body medical hibernation, but there are many fundamental questions that must be answered before we can start heading toward that goal.

[### Tinkering with prompts can only get you so far. (Sponsor)](https://you.com/landing/the-evolution-of-agent-management?utm_campaign=26337115-TLDR%20tech%20Q4&amp;utm_source=external-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=tldrtech_secondary_1121&amp;utm_content=tldrtech_secondary_1121)

Most companies get stuck tinkering with prompts and wonder why their agents fail to deliver dependable results. [This guide from You.com](https://you.com/landing/the-evolution-of-agent-management?utm_campaign=26337115-TLDR%20tech%20Q4&utm_source=external-newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=tldrtech_secondary_1121&utm_content=tldrtech_secondary_1121) breaks down the evolution of agent management, revealing the five stages for building a successful AI agent and why most organizations haven't gotten there yet.

[### How to write a great agents.md: Lessons from over 2,500 repositories (12 minute read)](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-write-a-great-agents-md-lessons-from-over-2500-repositories/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

GitHub's agents.md feature allows developers to create agents with custom instructions. agents.md is where developers define all of the specifics, provide code style examples, and set clear boundaries of what not to do. Most agent files fail because they're too vague. The best files provide agents with a clear job or persona, exact commands to run, well-defined boundaries to follow, and clear examples of good output for the agent to follow.

[### hl (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/pamburus/hl?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

hl is a high-performance log viewer and processor that transforms logs in JSON and logfmt formats into a human-readable output. It enables quick parsing and analysis of large log files with minimal overhead. hl features automatic pager integration, field-based filtering, level filtering, time-stamp range filtering, field visibility control, and more. It currently doesn't provide a built-in pager - users are recommended to install 'less'.

Cognitive design stitches memory, intuition, and prediction into something that feels like a partnership. The best companies design for anticipation. Mastering this balance results in products that feel simultaneously reliable and almost alive. The future belongs to companies that understand their users deeply and produce products that already know what customers need.
