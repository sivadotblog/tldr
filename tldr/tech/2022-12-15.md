[### Moderna‚Äôs mRNA cancer vaccine reduces risk of recurrence or death by 44% (3 minute read)](https://www.freethink.com/health/mrna-cancer-vaccine?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Moderna's new mRNA cancer vaccine reduced skin cancer patients' risk of recurrence or death by 44% compared to using only Merck's FDA-approved cancer treatment, Keytruda. The vaccine instructs patients' bodies to make up to 34 proteins found on tumor cells. The immune system learns to identify and target cancer cells as they are covered in the proteins. The process requires doctors to send samples of a patient's tumor to Moderna, who then manufactures a personalized mRNA vaccine. It takes several weeks to produce each vaccine.

[### Antihelium Offers Hope in the Search for Dark Matter (4 minute read)](https://archive.ph/aqmpJ#selection-489.41-495.150?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Antihelium, the antimatter twin of the helium atom, may be the key to discovering the nature of dark matter. No one has ever conclusively found a naturally occurring antihelium particle on Earth, but it could be abundant in our galaxy. It was first observed in 1970 after scientists produced the antiparticle in a collider. A team at the Large Hadron Collider recently generated around 18,000 antihelium nuclei. The data has been used to calculate the odds of Earth-based detectors capturing antihelium from space.
