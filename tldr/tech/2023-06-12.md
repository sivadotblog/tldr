[### GM follows Ford in adopting Teslas EV charging standard (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754470/gm-tesla-ev-supercharger-nacs-elon-musk?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

General Motors CEO Mary Barra announced on Thursday that the automaker will adopt Tesla's electric vehicle charging standard early next Spring. This will make thousands of Tesla Superchargers available to owners of GM electric vehicles. The first GM-produced electric vehicle to feature a Tesla charging port will arrive in 2025. GM temporarily suspended advertising on Twitter in October 2022 after Elon Musk's acquisition, but it posted a tweet to promote the announcement.

[### Apple still aiming to release a more affordable version of Vision Pro by the end of 2025 (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/11/apple-more-affordable-version-of-vision-pro/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is working on a more affordable version of the Vision Pro and aims to release it by the end of 2025. The lower-cost version will probably use lower-quality screens, a lower-spec processor, a smaller array of cameras and sensors, and a simpler headband design. It will likely still have the external EyeSight external screen and the same eye- and hand-tracking system. Apple is also working on a new version of the Vision Pro with a faster processor for even better performance.

[### Robot can rip the data out of RAM chips with chilling technology (5 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/09/cold_boot_ram_theft/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A cold boot attack is a way of extracting data, including encryption keys, from cooled memory chips. It involves literally freezing memory chips so that the data persists on them for several minutes even when powered down. The attack was first demonstrated back in 2008. Cold boot attacks can be countered with physical memory encryption. Red Balloon Security has developed a device that improves and automates the attack for around $2,000. Details about how the device and attack works are available in the article.

[### First mission to ‚Äòtouch‚Äô the sun catches the solar wind (4 minute read)](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/07/world/parker-solar-probe-solar-wind-scn/index.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Parker Solar Probe has discovered the source of solar wind. Solar wind is a continuous outflow of plasma from the Sun's outer atmosphere toward Earth. As magnetic fields pass each other on the Sun's surface, they break and reconnect, sending charged particles flying out of the Sun. The probe detected highly energetic particles traveling 10 to 100 times faster than the solar wind, leading researchers to believe that fast solar wind is created by the reconnection of magnetic fields. Understanding the source of solar winds can help scientists better predict solar storms, which can impact satellites and electrical grids.

[### Major Reddit communities will go dark to protest threat to third-party apps (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Some of Reddit's biggest communities are planning to set themselves private on June 12. These communities will be inaccessible for 48-hours or more to protest the site's new pricing for third-party app developers to access its APIs. Many third-party app developers have said that they will no longer be able to operate under the new pricing. One of Reddit's employees has argued that the new pricing would be affordable if the apps were more efficient with the API calls they make.

[### The Vision Pros biggest advantage isn't Apple's hardware (5 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/10/23755285/apple-vision-pro-developers-key-apps?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's developer ecosystem is a strong advantage. Developers can easily plug their existing apps into visionOS using familiar tools and frameworks. Other headsets so far have mostly relied on apps made in Unity or OpenXR, and key app offerings are limited. The Meta Quest Store has only released about 400 games and apps since opening several years ago. Apple is promising hundreds of thousands of apps on day one.
