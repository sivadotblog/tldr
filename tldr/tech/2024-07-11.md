[### OpenAI board shake-up: Microsoft out, Apple backs away amid AI partnership scrutiny (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/openai-board-shakeup-microsoft-out-apple-backs-away-amid-ai-partnership-scrutiny/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft and Apple will no longer have representatives in non-voting observer roles on OpenAI's board. Microsoft withdrew from the role while Apple opted not to take the position. OpenAI plans to update business partners and investors through regular meetings instead of board representation. The changes are likely a reaction to regulators in the EU and US increasing their scrutiny of Big Tech's investments in AI startups due to concerns about stifling competition.

Neuralink plans to implant its system into a second patient within the next few weeks. The company is aiming to implant its device in 'high single digits' of patients this year. While only around 15% of the channels in the first patient are still functional, the patient is still about to use the device to watch videos, read, and play chess or other video games, sometimes up to 70 hours per week. Neuralink will be making changes to address the hardware problems it encountered with its first participant, with a focus on mitigating retraction.

[### New HIV Prevention Drug Shows 100% Efficacy in Clinical Trial (7 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-hiv-prevention-drug-shows-100-efficacy-in-clinical-trial?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A twice-yearly injection of a new pre-exposure prophylaxis drug was shown to provide young women total protection from HIV infection in a large clinical trial performed in South Africa and Uganda.

[### Big tech jobs are not what they were (2 minute read)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1811058580704911757.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Today's big tech job options offer great compensation, incredible platforms for scale and impact, and slow but consistent growth over time. However, the kind of growth most companies experienced over the last few decades simply cannot happen again, rocket-ride careers are largely over, and there is increasing bureaucracy in the industry. Most of big tech is still laying off or not hiring and there is increasing return to office pressure. Working with big tech would suit people looking for stability, new graduates, and those looking for a path to retirement. Those who can afford higher risk, people who have already received credentials from a big tech job, and anyone who cannot stand being part of a large, slow system should look elsewhere.
