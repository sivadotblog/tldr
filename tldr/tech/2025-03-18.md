[### iPhone sales at risk, but Apple's first foldable in 2026 will change that (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/17/iphone-apple-first-foldable/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple plans to launch its first foldable in 2026. Market expectations for iPhone sales are lower due to the delay of the new Siri experience, but the launch of a foldable may help the company recover from weak demand for iPhones. At least one new foldable is targeted to enter mass production in the second half of 2026. The first foldable iPhone may cost more than $2,000 and look like an iPad mini when unfolded. Apple is also working on a foldable device with an 18-inch screen that could end up becoming a new Mac or iPad.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Researchers engineer bacteria to produce plastics (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/researchers-engineer-bacteria-to-produce-plastics/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team of Korean researchers has engineered a bacterial strain that can make useful polymers starting with nothing but glucose for fuel. The system can be tweaked to incorporate a huge range of chemicals into a variety of polymers. The resulting plastic can be tuned across many properties. There are still some issues, as the process doesn't allow complete control over what gets added into the polymer - the scientists couldn't stop enzymes from mixing random chemicals from the cells' metabolism into the polymers - and the polymers still need to be purified from the rest of the cell components before being used in manufacturing.

[### BYD confirms new 1,000V ‚ÄòSuper E-Platform' capable of fast charging 400km in 5 minutes (3 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2025/03/17/byd-confirms-1000v-super-e-platform-fast-charging-400km-5-minutes/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

BYD has a new EV architecture that will enable charging parity with gas station visits. The Super E-Platform promises 1,000 kW charge speeds - double the current industry leaders. Most fast chargers on the market can only reach about 350 kW and many of them are usually more in the 200s. BYD has launched new Han L and Tang L models that use the new fast-charging platform. The company plans to implement over 4,000 ultra-fast charging stations around China.

[### Verifiability is the Limit (7 minute read)](https://alperenkeles.com/posts/verifiability-is-the-limit/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There are many beliefs about the limits, usefulness, and potential of large language models. Every piece of software needs to be 'correct', which means that the software conforms to the intent of the creator. The creator has to verify such conformance - it cannot be offloaded. Verifiability is the limit that tells us what we can't implement via large language models, and it cannot be solved with agentic approaches.

[### Discord launches SDK to help developers enhance social experiences in their games (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/discord-launches-sdk-to-help-developers-enhance-social-experiences-in-their-games/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The new Discord Social SDK is a free toolkit that allows developers to enhance their games' social and multiplayer experiences by leveraging Discord's social infrastructure. Developers will be able to improve their in-game experiences for players regardless of whether they have a Discord account. The social integrations include a unified friends list and deep-linked game invites that enable players to invite their friends to directly join their party or lobby. The SDK is compatible with C++, Unreal Engine, and Unity and supports Windows 11+ and macOS - support for console and mobile is coming.
