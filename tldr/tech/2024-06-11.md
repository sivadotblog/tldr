[### Solar-Powered Planes Take Flight (8 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/solar-powered-aircraft-planes-research-e551596c?st=zzcvqkkbi3g3t6t&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Solar-powered planes could lead to new alternatives for aerial surveillance and telecommunications. Aviation giants, telecommunication companies, venture investors, and the military are already spending millions of dollars developing the technology. These planes never need refueling and can stay in the air as long as the sun is shining. Advances in battery technology have finally made it feasible to power a solar plane through the night.

[### We just broke ground on America's first next-gen nuclear facility (5 minute read)](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Wyoming-TerraPower-groundbreaking?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Kemmerer, Wyoming, will soon be home to the most advanced nuclear facility in the world. It will hopefully come online in 2030. There is still a review process to be completed - TerraPower will build out the non-nuclear parts of the facility in the meantime. Started by Bill Gates in 2008, TerraPower is leading the country and the world in developing safe, next-generation nuclear technology.

[### The Functional Programming Hiring Problem (20 minute read)](https://blog.janissary.xyz/posts/hiring-functional-programming?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

When hiring for functional programming languages, you primarily pick from either resume spammers, bright undergraduates, or senior engineers who only want to work with that particular language. Resume spammers can be safely ignored. Bright undergraduates can be a source of great potential. Senior engineers who only want to work with a particular language may look like the best candidates, but they may be too focused on the tool to see the goals of the business.

[### Study finds a quarter of bosses hoped RTO would make employees quit (4 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/09/rto_quit_study/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A study of more than 1,500 employees found that a quarter of executives and a fifth of HR professionals hoped that return-to-office (RTO) mandates would result in staff leaving. While people did quit when RTO mandates were enforced at many of the largest companies, it wasn't enough - many of the layoffs in the past 12 months were believed to be a result of too few people leaving in protest of RTO mandates. Many employees feel that management wants them back in the office to monitor them more closely. This has resulted in the growth of an office culture that is even more performative, suspicious, and divisive than before the COVID-19 pandemic.

[### Apple's AI promise: ‚ÄúYour data is never stored or made accessible to Apple‚Äù (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/apples-ai-promise-your-data-is-never-stored-or-made-accessible-by-apple/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's new Apple Intelligence system will use Private Cloud Compute to ensure any data processed on its cloud servers is protected in a transparent and verifiable way. Many of Apple's generative AI models can run entirely on a device powered by an A17+ or M-series chip. When a bigger model is required to fulfill a generative AI request, Apple Intelligence only sends relevant data to complete the task to special Apple silicon servers. Customer data will not be saved for future server access or used to further train models. The server code used for Private Cloud Compute will be publicly accessible.
