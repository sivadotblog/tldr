[### In a world first, perovskite-silicon solar cells break the 30% efficiency barrier (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/in-a-world-first-perovskite-silicon-solar-cells-break-the-30-efficiency-barrier?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_content=13072022?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team of researchers has smashed the efficiency record for tandem silicon-perovskite solar cells. The team produced cells with over 30% efficiency while using low-cost materials and processes. It achieved the feat by creating tandem solar cells that absorb the sun's higher-energy visible light in one area and the lower-energy infrared light in another. The potential of tandem silicon-perovskite technologies has long been theorized, but this is the first time it has been demonstrated.

[### Functional programming is finally going mainstream (9 minute read)](https://github.com/readme/featured/functional-programming?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Functional programming is a paradigm that emphasizes writing programs using stateless functions that always return the same value when given the same input. These functions don't change any existing data or modify other parts of an application's logic. The paradigm emphasizes a separation of data and logic. It creates reusable software that is easy to write and debug. This article discusses functional programming, the rise of functional programming in mainstream languages, and the future of functional programming.
