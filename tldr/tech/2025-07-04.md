[### Apple looked into building its own AWS competitor (3 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/03/report-apple-looked-into-building-its-own-aws-competitor/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple's Project ACDC (Apple Chips in Data Centers) would have provided developer cloud services running on Apple's own chips. Apple executives believed that Apple silicon could offer better AI inference performance at a lower cost. It already uses its own chips inside its data centers for Private Cloud Compute, Siri, and services like Photos and Apple Music. The status of the project is unclear as the executive who championed the idea left the company in 2023.

OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever will assume the CEO role at Safe Superintelligence, the artificial intelligence startup he launched last year, as the previous CEO, Daniel Gross, was poached by Meta. Safe Superintelligence co-founder Danielle Levy will now serve as president. The company's technical team will continue to report to Sutskever. Sutskever plans to keep running the company as an independent organization.

[### Scientists spot mystery object believed to come from beyond solar system (4 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jul/03/nasa-interstellar-comet-solar-system-a11pl3z-3i-atlas?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Astronomers have discovered a new object hurtling through the solar system. Known as 3I/Atlas, the object is about 416 million miles away from the Sun and believed to be traveling at about 37 miles per second relative to the Sun. If confirmed, it will provide more evidence that such interstellar wanderers are relatively common in our galaxy. The comet poses no threat to Earth. It will reach its closest approach to the Sun - within about 130 million miles - around October 30.

Germany's Wendelstein 7-X, an advanced fusion reactor, set a record last May by magnetically 'bottling up' superheated plasma for 43 seconds. The large Joint European Torus (JET) fusion reactor near Oxford, England, achieved even longer containment times of up to 60 seconds in final experiments before its retirement in December 2023. These results, among other recent advances in the field, are bringing fusion power closer and closer to reality. This article presents an overview of the current field of fusion to show how the elusive dream of controlled nuclear fusion may soon be within reach.

[### Introducing tmux-rs (12 minute read)](https://richardscollin.github.io/tmux-rs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This developer ported tmux to Rust - they recently reached the milestone of having the code base being 100% unsafe Rust. This post discusses the process of porting the original code base from around 67,000 lines of C code to around 81,000 lines of Rust, excluding comments and empty lines. The post covers interesting bugs, C patterns in Rust, development tools, and more. The developer's next goal is to convert the code base to safe Rust.

[### Caching is an Abstraction, not an Optimization (5 minute read)](https://buttondown.com/jaffray/archive/caching-is-an-abstraction-not-an-optimization/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Caching is best understood as a tool for making software simpler rather than as a tool to improve performance. It resembles an abstraction rather than an optimization. Understanding this makes it possible to come up with designs that work and satisfy the functional requirements of systems from the perspective of 'having adequate, fast access to the data it needs'. The problem should be figuring out how to get data into fast storage as often as possible instead of gaming a system that is holding data access storage.

[### Samsung seems to have leaked its own trifold phone design (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/news/697395/samsung-galaxy-trifold-foldable-leaks-one-ui-8?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Samsung's latest One UI 8 build update contains animations that show what the trifold Samsung flagship might look like. While it is labeled the ' Multifold 7' in the files, the device is speculated to be called the 'Galaxy G Fold'. The animations reveal how the device will likely fold - there are two differently sized hinges, with the left-hand display folding inward, suggesting the right-hand display is designed to sandwich over the top. Samsung is expected to reveal the latest generation of its Z Fold and Z Flip devices at its next Unpacked event on July 9.

[### Tesla Optimus is in shambles as head of program exits, production delayed (2 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2025/07/03/tesla-optimus-shambles-head-of-program-exits-production-delayed/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla's humanoid robot program is reportedly in disarray due to the departure of the senior vice-president in charge. Production has been delayed due to a new redesign. The robot has yet to prove useful in Tesla's factories. Elon Musk's goal for Tesla to produce 5,000 to 10,000 Optimus humanoid robots this year has been delayed - Tesla has informed suppliers of a two-month halt on orders. The company is likely to unveil a new generation of Optimus robots at its shareholders' meeting this year.
