[### Goodbye low test coverage and slow QA cycles (Sponsor)](https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=ACQ_All_Demo_Conversions__NewsletterAudience_-_Newsletter_GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_20251111-None_Experiment-FALSE&amp;utm_term=headline-GoodbyeLowTestCoverageAndSlowQACycles&amp;utm_content=GoodbyeLowTestCoverage_ScheduleADemoToLearnMore_None_Headline%3AGoodbyeLowTestCoverageAndSlowQACycles____Newsletter-PrimaryPlacement_20251111_v1_)

Bugs sneak out when less than 80% of user flows are tested before shipping. However, getting that kind of coverage (and staying there) is hard and pricey for any team.

### Big Tech & Startups

[### Anthropic Is on Track to Turn a Profit Much Faster Than OpenAI (7 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-anthropic-profitability-e9f5bcd6?st=2AqtKX&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthropic expects to break even for the first time in 2028. OpenAI's operating losses for 2028 are forecasted to swell to about $74 billion - it doesn't expect to turn a profit until 2030. OpenAI is investing far more into its chips and data centers to turn OpenAI into a multitrillion-dollar tech giant. The strategy requires near-constant fundraising, which could backfire if markets cool on the technology or its near-term profitability.

[### iPhone Air Sales Are So Bad That Apple's Delaying the Next-Generation Version (3 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/10/next-generation-iphone-air-delayed/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple will delay the launch of the next-generation iPhone Air that was scheduled to be released with the iPhone 18 Pro. The iPhone Air has faced poor sales and manufacturing cuts. The novel look of the device failed to spark interest, despite its substantial design update. Apple is planning a split launch for the iPhone 18 models - the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and foldable iPhone are planned for the fall of 2026, while the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e will be released in early 2027.

[### Here's how orbital dynamics wizardry helped save NASA's next Mars mission (13 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/heres-how-orbital-dynamics-wizardry-helped-save-nasas-next-mars-mission/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NASA's ESCAPADE mission is set to launch tomorrow at 2:50 PM EST on Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket. The mission was delayed last year as its rocket wasn't ready to send it to Mars during its appointed launch window. Mars is now more than 220 million miles away from where it was during last year's launch window - this isn't a big deal, as the mission will follow a 'kidney-bean' shaped trajectory to reach the planet. Such techniques are necessary if humans are to send hundreds of spacecraft to Mars, as it would be difficult to launch only within certain timeframes for direct flights.

Louis Andre, a 27-year-old who grew up in Europe, recently revealed a new company backed by Sam Altman called Episteme. Episteme is an effort to attract the world's top scientists and have them work on a wide range of breakthrough products. It will allow scientists to do away with fundraising pressures and grant writing and spend most of their time on research. The company will also help scientists deal with intellectual property concerns, tax issues, hiring, and other day-to-day support functions to help them turn their ideas into blockbuster products.

[### Becoming a compiler engineer (16 minute read)](https://rona.substack.com/p/becoming-a-compiler-engineer?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Compiler engineers are software engineers who implement programming languages. There is very little information online about how to break into this niche - this post aims to help those interested in the field understand what working in the role is like and how to get a job working with compilers. Compiler engineer roles are relatively rare due to limited demand - once a compiler is built, the work is mostly maintenance and optimization, and most companies don't build their own compilers. The job market can be brutal, but it's possible to stand out even without a preexisting network.

The twenty-first century is starting to build machines and systems that don't need as many humans. Automation is a slow and uneven pressure that makes jobs appear as well as disappear. Right now, the good jobs at the center of the curve are thinning out, and junior entry points are being quietly closed. Graduates are being told to become outliers while competing with systems that learn from everything they do.

Smartphones have become humanity's second cognitive organ, but using the devices harshly disconnects users from the world around them. The only form factor that seems to have a chance to replace the smartphone is AR glasses. Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are still highly dependent on mobile devices, and they only provide a small display visible to one eye, but they give users a glimpse into what the future may look like. This article provides a detailed review of the device along with the Meta Neural Band that pairs with it. The technology is still very much a first-generation product, but it shows promise.
