[### Apple Planning to Launch Vision Pro by February (2 minute read)](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/vision-pro-february-launch/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple has ramped up production of the Vision Pro to meet its goal of launching the device by February. Sales of the device will be limited to the US to begin with. Customers will need to purchase or pick up their devices in-store as Apple wants to ensure customers have the right headband size and Light Seal for an appropriate fit. Apple plans to do headset assembly for customers who need custom Zeiss prescription lenses in its retail locations. There probably won't be a launch event for the device.

[### Tesla removes stock-based compensation this year (2 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2023/12/20/tesla-removes-stock-based-compensation-this-year-report/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla has reportedly decided not to give stock-based compensation to employees as part of their annual performance reviews this year. Some employees who were reaching the end of their four-year vesting cycles were given stock refreshers to keep their total compensation competitive. Tesla is still doing modest cost-of-living increases and adjustments to its base salaries. It is unclear whether this will be a new policy going forward. Tesla regularly changes its employee compensations, and not always in a straightforward way.

[### Waymo finds that its driverless cars ‚Äòsignificantly outperformed‚Äô humans (2 minute read)](https://9to5google.com/2023/12/20/waymo-driverless-humans/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A safety study from Waymo found that its driverless cars led to a significant reduction in the rates of police-reported and injury-causing crashes compared to human drivers. There were 85% less injuries for crashes involving the Waymo Driver and 57% fewer police reports. The accidents covered in the study included all crashes, regardless of the vehicle's role in the crash. Waymo is pushing broadly for international standardization for valid analysis of autonomous vehicle crash data.

[### The Brain-Implant Company Going for Neuralink‚Äôs Jugular (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/synchron-bci?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Synchron has a brain-computer interface that promises to provide an invaluable communication method to people with severe paralysis without open brain surgery. The device is delivered like a stent, inserted into the jugular vein in the neck and then moved to a blood vessel near the brain's motor cortex. It allows people who suffer from brain-stem stroke or degenerative diseases to do basic computer tasks like sending messages and accessing digital health services without moving a muscle. The company is now in the middle of a US-based feasibility study, which, if successful, could lead to a larger study that will determine whether the device gets approved for clinical use.

[### My jaw hit the floor when I watched an AI master one of the world's toughest physical games in just six hours (4 minute read)](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/my-jaw-hit-the-floor-when-i-watched-an-ai-master-one-of-the-worlds-toughest-physical-games-in-just-six-hours?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI can master the game Labyrinth in just six hours. Labyrinth is an incredibly difficult physical board game that challenges players to navigate a metal ball through a hole-riddled maze by changing the orientation of the game platform using twistable knobs on the side of the game's box frame. It takes fine motor control, dexterity, and a lot of real-time problem-solving to complete the game. The AI was exponentially better than humans at completing the game, with a best time of 14.8 seconds - without cheating.
