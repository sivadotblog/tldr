[### Apple‚Äôs Plans for the DMA in the European Union (26 minute read)](https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/apples_plans_for_the_dma?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple has announced a broad, wide-ranging, and complex set of new policies regarding its intended compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). This article looks at Apple's proposed changes. Anti-big-business regulation and pro-consumer results often go hand-in-hand, but the DMA exposes issues with these types of regulations. The DMA will likely not change much for the better for iOS users in the EU. Its practical effects will likely make things worse for users.

[### The Rooftop Solar Industry Could Be On the Verge of Collapse (11 minute read)](https://time.com/6565415/rooftop-solar-industry-collapse/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Solar panel salespeople obscuring the specific terms of financial agreements and clouding the value of their products are causing a storm in the solar panel industry. Law firms across the US are claiming to receive multiple calls every week from potential clients with stories of dodgy salespeople causing them to sign up for deals that they can't afford. Some of the nation's biggest public solar companies are struggling to stay afloat as questions arise over the viability of the financial products they sold to both customers and investors. These factors could topple the residential solar industry: more than 100 solar dealers and installers in the US declared bankruptcy in late 2023 alone.

[### A new AI model called Morpheus-1 claims to induce lucid dreaming (4 minute read)](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/would-you-let-ai-into-your-mind-a-new-model-called-morpheus-1-claims-to-induce-lucid-dreaming?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Prophetic, a neurotechnology startup, has a new AI model called Morpheus-1 that it claims can help people enter a lucid dream state. The model takes the current brain state as a prompt and generates ultrasound holograms that can be sent to the brain to start the lucid dream state and keep it stable. Lucid dreaming is a type of dream state where the dreamer is aware they are asleep and can control the dream. Prophetic plans to release a headband product called The Halo in beta in the Spring. The device sends sound waves into the brain to connect with the current brain state and put the mind into a lucid state.

[### Simon Willison interview: AI software still needs the human touch (16 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/24/willison_ai_software_development/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

[### Ask HN: Those who've joined a friend's startup as an employee, how did that go? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39171079&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The dynamics of joining a friend's startup as an employee aren't widely discussed. This Hacker News thread provides many personal anecdotes of what the experience is like. While some people report positive experiences, many replies tell the story of how the decision to work at a friend's startup ultimately cost them the friendship. Working with friends may be more enjoyable, but the decision to join a startup should be based on the startup itself rather than the friendship - is the opportunity good, does it progress your career, does it pay you well, and is the equity fair?
