[### Florida Startup Moves Closer to Building Data Centers on the Moon (3 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/startup-moves-closer-building-data-centers-moon-1850192177?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Lonestar Data Holdings, a cloud computing startup, has raised $5 million to build data centers on the lunar surface for secure data storage and edge processing. Storing data remotely on the Moon will alleviate energy consumption and digital pollution problems caused by Earth-based data centers. Lonestar's lunar data centers will initially be used for remote data storage and disaster recovery, as well as support for commercial and private exploration of the Moon. The company aims to launch a miniature data center box, which weighs about 2 pounds and has a capacity of 16 terabytes, to the lunar surface this year.

[### Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models (17 minute read)](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/emergent-abilities-of-large-language-models/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article explores the concept of emergence and its relationship with Large language models (LLMs) and AI. LLMs are probabilistic models that can learn and generate natural language patterns. As LLMs are scaled and trained on more data, their ability to learn these patterns improves as observed by quantitative metrics. However, the scaling process also unlocks new and unexpected qualitative behavior, such as the ability to perform arithmetic and summarize passages, which LLMs learn through natural language observation. These emergent abilities appear suddenly and unpredictably, leading to questions about their cause and significance.

[### Why the floppy disk just won‚Äôt die (9 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/why-the-floppy-disk-just-wont-die/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The world‚Äôs reliance on floppy disks continues to linger years after their manufacturers stopped producing them. Machines across industries, from medical equipment to aircraft, are still dependent on them. Many of the companies using them are small to medium businesses or those constrained by costs. The supply limitations will eventually force people to upgrade or replace their equipment. The disks once manufactured have a finite supply, and a portion of that supply is being consumed every day. No one knows the exact size of this inventory, but it is believed to be dispersed among many small collections.
