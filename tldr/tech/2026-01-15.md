AI agents are reshaping digital experiences, but securing them requires rethinking identity and access controls built for a human-first world. That's why we built [Auth0 for AI Agents](https://auth0.com/signup?onboard_app=auth_for_aa&ocid=701KZ000000cXXxYAM_aPA4z0000008OZeGAM?utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=amer_namer_usa_all_ciam_dev_dg_plg_auth0_native_tldr_native_aud_jan_2026_placements_utm2&utm_medium=cpc&utm_id=aNKWR000002mh1V4AQ), now GA.

Connect your AI agents to apps and data more securely, give users control over the AI agents' actions and data access, and enable human confirmation for critical agent actions. Auth0 for AI Agents is the complete auth solution for building AI agents more securely.

### Big Tech & Startups

[### 2026 May Be the Year of the Mega IPO (5 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/14/technology/ai-ipo-openai-anthropic-spacex.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ElA.fCyc.ZIEkxhEltK43&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

At least three of the most valuable and highest-profile tech companies are currently preparing to list their shares on the public market. Anthropic, OpenAI, and SpaceX have all taken early steps to go public. Any of these companies would be among the most valuable ever to go public. The listings could create an enormous bonanza for Wall Street, which has seen a slump in IPOs since 2021.

[### Musk says Tesla is moving Full Self-Driving to a monthly subscription (3 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/musk-tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-fsd.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla will stop selling its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software for a flat rate and instead only offer it as a monthly subscription after February 14. The feature will start at $99 per month. It was previously priced at a one-time payment of $8,000. The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel ready to steer or brake at any time.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Genetic Therapy Aims To Bring Hearing To Those Born Deaf (3 minute read)](https://hackaday.com/2026/01/14/genetic-therapy-aims-to-bring-hearing-to-those-born-deaf/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OTOF-related hearing loss results from a genetic change in a single critical protein. The auditory nerve fails to receive the proper signals from the hair cells in the ear due to the lack of the proper protein, resulting in profound deafness. DB-OTO is a virus-based gene therapy that can deliver a working version of the OTOF gene. It uses a non-pathogenic virus to carry the proper genetic code that produces the protein. In an early trial of the DB-OTO treatment, eleven out of twelve patients developed improved hearing within weeks, and nine patients no longer required cochlear implants.

[### Elon Musk surprises everyone: SpaceX will attempt to reach Mars by the end of 2026 (4 minute read)](https://www.msn.com/en-ie/money/other/elon-musk-surprises-everyone-spacex-will-attempt-to-reach-mars-by-the-end-of-2026/ar-AA1TZA2z?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX has announced plans for a potential uncrewed mission to Mars as early as late 2026. The proposed schedule coincides with a rare planetary alignment between Earth and Mars that offers a narrow but valuable launch opportunity. Several core technologies essential to deep space travel remain in development. Starship Version 3 is expected to debut this year. It will feature upgrades that may prove pivotal to long-duration missions beyond Earth orbit.

[### Feel like you're working more, but getting less done? Inside the hidden productivity crisis (Sponsor)](https://miro.com/events/hidden-productivity-crisis-research-it-leaders/?utm_campaign=TLDR&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=Momentumatwork&amp;utm_term=second&amp;src=-tldr_glb)

55% of knowledge workers are putting in more hours but delivering less. The culprit? Well over half say that fragmentation is a productivity killer. Miro's [2025 Momentum at Work Report](https://miro.com/events/hidden-productivity-crisis-research-it-leaders/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_content=Momentumatwork&utm_term=second&src=-tldr_glb) lays out the costs of tool sprawl and the solutions that get teams back on track.

[### Junior Developers in the Age of AI (8 minute read)](https://thoughtfuleng.substack.com/p/junior-developers-in-the-age-of-ai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The most compelling reason to hire juniors is AI itself. The biggest barrier to AI transformation has been workforce buy-in. Gen Z leads in AI adoption, and they act as an accelerant, helping colleagues learn AI tools and workflows. AI has lowered the cost of onboarding. If the infrastructure already exists, hiring juniors may be one of the highest-leverage AI bets available today.

[### Scaling long-running autonomous coding (6 minute read)](https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Model choice matters for extremely long-running tasks. GPT-5.2 models perform better at extended autonomous work compared to Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.1-codex. Many improvements come from removing complexity rather than adding it. The best system is often simpler than you'd expect. The harness and models matter, but the prompts matter more.

[### 2026: This is AGI (10 minute read)](https://sequoiacap.com/article/2026-this-is-agi/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Long-horizon agents allow models to take actions and iterate over time. The rate of progress in this area of research is exponential. It is estimated that agents will be able to work reliably to complete tasks comparably to human experts by 2028. People will soon be able to hire agents - one of the litmus tests for AGI.

[### When Will They Take Our Jobs? (12 minute read)](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2026/01/14/when-will-they-take-our-jobs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Humans will lose control over the future if AI capabilities continue to advance. However, if we manage to avoid that, there's a good chance humans will retain a lot of employment during the Cyborg Era, which might last around 10 to 20 years. It is implausible that AI capabilities and available compute continue to increase indefinitely. This is a transitional state.
