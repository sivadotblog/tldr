üö®Open AI reached a valuation of $340 billion this year, all on the back of your data.

The big data gold rush is here, but profits have been hoarded by AI and tech giants‚Ä¶ Until now.

Instead of hoarding data, Mode Mobile is sharing the profits from it, all by [turning your smartphone into an income-generating asset.](https://invest.modemobile.com/?utm_source=dmrregahome&utm_medium=Partner82-01&utm_campaign=Newsletter_ID3650&utm_content=&tnames=Partner82-01) Here's what that looks like:

[### Inside Google's Investment in the A.I. Start-Up Anthropic (4 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/technology/google-investment-anthropic.html?unlocked_article_code=1.3U4.dmFQ.aISUjy27ohZe&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google owns 14% of Anthropic. Its investment gives it little control over the AI startup - Google holds no voting rights, no board seats, and no board observer rights at Anthropic. Google is set to invest an additional $750 million in Anthropic in September through a convertible debt - it has invested more than $3 billion into the AI company in total so far. It is only allowed to own up to 15% of Anthropic.

[### OpenAI says it has trained an AI that's ‚Äòreally good' at creative writing (1 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/openai-says-it-has-trained-an-ai-thats-really-good-at-creative-writing/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman claims that his company has trained a new model that is 'really good' at creative writing. It is unknown how and when the model will be released. OpenAI has previously focused on challenges in the fields of math and programming rather than creative writing. The company experimenting with writing suggests that the latest generation of models has vastly improved on the wordsmithing front.

SPHEREx and PUNCH lifted off from the Vandenburg Space Force Base at 11:11 PM ET on Tuesday. SPHEREx is a space telescope that will take images of the entire sky in more than a hundred colors that are invisible to the human eye. PUNCH is a suite of satellites that will study the Sun's outer atmosphere and solar wind. This article gets into the specifics of what the missions aim to do.

[### Australian man survives 100 days with artificial heart in world-first success (4 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/12/australian-man-survives-100-days-with-artificial-heart-in-world-first-success?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

An Australian man lived with a totally artificial heart for 100 days before receiving a donor heart transplant in early March. The BiVACOR total artificial heart uses magnetic levitation technology to replicate the natural blood flow of a healthy heart. The implant is still in the early stages of clinical study, but it looks to be a promising alternative for patients who are unable to wait for a donor heart or when a donor heart is simply not available. There is still a long way to go before the artificial heart could be considered a replacement for a heart transplant - the functioning time span of the device is still significantly less than that of a donor heart.

[### OpenAI pushes AI agent capabilities with new developer API (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/openai-pushes-ai-agent-capabilities-with-new-developer-api/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's new Responses API is designed to help software developers create AI agents that perform tasks independently using the company's AI models. It will eventually replace the Assistants API, which OpenAI plans to retire in the first half of 2026. The Responses API can access the same models that power ChatGPT Search. The technology still has significant limitations, such as issues navigating websites and models making factual mistakes. OpenAI has also released the Agents SDK to provide developers tools to integrate models with internal systems, implement safeguards, and monitor agent activities.

[### Here's how I use LLMs to help me write code (30 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/#atom-everything?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Using large language models (LLMs) to write code is difficult and unintuitive and there's little guidance to help people figure out how best to apply them. The patterns that work well do not come naturally to everyone. This post guides readers on how to achieve great results when programming with LLMs. One of the biggest advantages of LLMs is speed of development - LLMs enable developers to ship projects that they previously wouldn't have been able to justify spending any time on.

[### Y Combinator founders raising less money signals a ‚Äòvibe shift,' VC says (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/y-combinator-founders-raising-less-money-signal-a-vibe-shift-vc-says/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There has been a 'vibe shift' from and of the founders in Y Combinator's current batch - people want to achieve their dreams with as little VC as possible. This wasn't due to a lack of interest by VCs - the round was oversubscribed. It's becoming more common for YC startups to raise less capital than was offered to them by investors. Raising less means founders maintain a larger ownership stake in their companies, giving themselves more ongoing business and exit options.

Sphere Entertainment is working on a design for mini-Spheres with a capacity for about 5,000 people. Smaller investigations of the Sphere could potentially attract a wider range of artists. Designing and producing the custom video content required for the venue requires a hefty investment from performers. There are no details on where or when the mini-Spheres would be built. The company plans to build a second full-sized Sphere in Abu Dhabi.
