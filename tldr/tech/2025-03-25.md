[### Google Is Searching for an Answer to ChatGPT (32 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-03-24/google-s-ai-search-overhaul-racing-chatgpt-for-the-web-s-future?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0Mjg3MTEyMiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNDc1OTIyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVE5CT0lEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.VWc3Cr6SiRPg3amxHY-RHxI_MITOvXjwZ5NgH0fUUys&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google's search engine is one of the most profitable technologies ever developed, and there's little evidence that this is changing, but the company is acting with urgency, focusing on generative AI efforts. Multiple independent web publishers say their traffic has been falling as Google's AI overviews present information directly on Google's own results pages. The relationship between Google and publishers is tense - Google is framing it as a broad conversation about the changing nature of search. Big changes are coming to Search, and the web may never be the same.

[### Genetic testing company 23andMe declares bankruptcy (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/genetic-testing-company-23andme-declares-bankruptcy/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

23andMe has entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy and has asked a court to arrange its sale. The company's entire board resigned back in September due to a conflict between its board about future directions - the company has been losing money for years. There is enough funding to continue operations until a buyer is found. The pending sale has raised significant privacy concerns. The US prevents the use of genetic data for use in health insurance and employment decisions, but plenty of other uses are still legal, and customers outside of the US may have far fewer protections.

[### Eli Lilly will soon release key data on its weight loss pill. Here's why it could be a game-changer (13 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/eli-lilly-to-release-weight-loss-pill-orforglipron-trial-data-.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Eli Lilly expects to unveil data from several late-stage clinical trials on its experimental once-daily obesity pill this year. Orforglipron is predicted to be as effective, safe, and tolerable to take as semaglutide. The pill targets GLP-1 to suppress appetite and regulate blood sugar. It is unclear whether the pill will have a hefty price similar to current GLP-1 injections, which cost roughly $1,000 per month. The pill could receive US regulatory approval as soon as early 2026.

[### New CRISPR tool enables more seamless gene editing ‚Äî and improved disease modeling (3 minute read)](https://news.yale.edu/2025/03/20/new-crispr-tool-enables-more-seamless-gene-editing-and-improved-disease-modeling?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at Yale have developed a series of sophisticated mouse models using CRISPR technology that can simultaneously assess genetic interactions on a host of immunological responses to multiple diseases, including cancer. The new tool, CRISPR-Cas12a, can induce and track changes in a variety of immune system cells in response to gene editing and fine-tune sets of genes in different directions simultaneously. It enables the rapid generation of new disease and treatment models. The tool will be valuable to researchers creating therapies for a host of pathologies, including cancer, metabolic disease, autoimmune disease, and neurological disorders.

[### Ledger Implementation in PostgreSQL (4 minute read)](https://www.pgrs.net/2025/03/24/pgledger-ledger-implementation-in-postgresql/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

pgledger is a financial ledger implementation implemented entirely in PostgreSQL. It makes it easy to view the history to understand why an account balance is at its current value and query for a historical value at a given time. pgledger uses just functions and tables so users can have the full power of PostgreSQL and avoid integrating with any new APIs or run any new services.

[### Recruiter accidentally emailed me her secret internal selection guidelines üëÄ (Reddit Thread)](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/1jhitoc/recruiter_accidently_emailed_me_her_secret/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A job recruiter accidentally included their secret internal selection guidelines when contacting a potential job candidate. The guidelines listed specific educational institutions candidates must have attended, types of candidates to avoid (visa candidates, job hoppers, graduates from coding boot camps, people with experience limited to big companies, and more), and other qualifications. The listing disqualified candidates who have ever worked at Intel, Cisco, HP, Dell, Capgemini, and several other companies. The listing indicates that top-tier CS schools are the primary path to early career jobs right now.

[### It Wasn't the Apple TV+ Spend, It Was the Apple TV+ Strategy (8 minute read)](https://spyglass.org/apple-tv-plus-strategy/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple made a series of strategic blunders with regard to Apple TV+. The company clearly thought it could use its clout to bully its way into making massive Hollywood hits, but the move was miscalculated - even the marketing was bad. Netflix is the only real tech company that has bent Hollywood to its will and that's largely because it had a great strategy from the beginning and stuck to it, while also being malleable enough as needed. Expectations and strategy have seemingly reset within Apple - the company is now changing to meet the market it arrogantly walked into.

[### Why Anthropic's Claude still hasn't beaten Pok√©mon (18 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/why-anthropics-claude-still-hasnt-beaten-pokemon/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Claude Plays Pok√©mon has been struggling to make consistent progress in Pok√©mon, but even this sub-human level of performance could hold significant lessons for the quest toward artificial general intelligence. The AI model has been struggling to interpret the game's pixelated world as well as a human would, but it performs better in the text-based portions of the game. It has trouble remembering some of the information that it has learned and making sense of what it knows, sometimes inserting incorrect information into its knowledge base. The system's progress can vary quite a bit between runs. There are some signs it can tell when it doesn't know what it is doing and that it needs to be doing something different.
