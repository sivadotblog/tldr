[### Experimental fentanyl vaccine stops the drug from entering the brain (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/fentanyl-vaccine/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new vaccine developed by a team led by the University of Houston blocks fentanyl's effect on the brain. It uses a fentanyl-like molecule which elicits the production of antibodies that bind to it when combined with a larger carrier protein.

The antibodies leave all other molecules alone, making other types of opioids still effective for pain relief.
