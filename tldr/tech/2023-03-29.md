[### Apple Pay Later is finally launching (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23660128/apple-pay-later-buy-now-launches?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple has launched its buy now, pay later service. Apple Pay Later allows users to apply for loans between $50 to $1,000 via the Apple Wallet with no fees or interest. Users will have six weeks to repay the loan amount through four payments. Although Apple claims Pay Later loans won't affect users' credit, the fine print warns that loan and payment history may be reported to credit bureaus and could impact credit. The service is currently available for randomly selected users in the US for in-app and online purchases on iOS 16.4 and iPadOS 16.4.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Scientists Created a New Recyclable Plastic Not Made From Crude Oil (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-created-a-new-recyclable-plastic-not-made-from-crude-oil?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at Boise State University have developed a new plastic called PECA made from the same monomer used to make Super Glue. Small-scale lab experiments suggest that 93% of the plastic can be recycled into clean starter materials, even if mixed together with other types of plastic waste, paper, or aluminum. PECA plastic thermally 'cracks' at 210 ¬∞C. The resulting monomers can be distilled for reuse. If introduced on an industrial scale, PECA plastic could replace polystyrene plastics that are typically non-recyclable.

[### These scientists are probing secrets of squid camouflage by hacking human cells (6 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/these-scientists-are-probing-secrets-of-squid-camouflage-by-hacking-human-cells/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, have replicated the properties of squid skin cells in human cells in the lab. The team introduced squid-derived genes that encode reflectin into human cells. Reflectin is a protein that clumps together into nanoparticles to scatter light. The study focused on understanding the characteristics of the protein and its ability to self-assemble into structures. The resulting human cells were able to create reflectin structures that were very similar, and with comparable refractive indices, to those in squid cells.

It feels like everyone is building something on OpenAI. If you're already using or plan to use GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or the ChatGPT APIs at scale, it's important to monitor metrics like [average request time, total requests, and total cost](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/new-relic-integration-with-gpt-3?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=global-fy23-q4-new-relic-integration-with-gpt-3).

Research by Goldman Sachs suggests that AI could automate a quarter of the work done in the US and eurozone. The technology could spark a productivity boom that could raise annual gross domestic product by 7% over a 10-year period. It will likely bring significant disruption to the labor market and affect an estimated 300 million full-time workers. Around 7% of workers in the US are in jobs that could be completely replaced by AI.

ChatGPT may have started out as a demo, but it is now on its way to being the next major consumer tech platform. The integration of plugins last week signaled a major shift in ambition. It could mean that OpenAI may eventually kill its API in favor of the ChatGPT platform. While this is unlikely, startups building on OpenAPI's API should consider alternatives.
