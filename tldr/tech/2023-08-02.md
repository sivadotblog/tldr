Meta is developing a range of AI personas that mimic human-like conversations to increase user engagement. The company envisions AI agents acting as assistants and coaches, helping users interact with businesses and creators. AI personas could provide search, recommendations, and a fun and interactive element for Meta's platforms. Meta plans to roll out the personas as early as September.

[### Meta Reveals New Prototype VR Headsets Focused on Retinal Resolution and Light Field Passthrough (3 minute read)](https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-prototype-vr-retinal-resoltion-light-field-passthrough/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta unveiled two new VR headset prototypes at SIGGRAPH 2023. One prototype has a display system that provides visual clarity closely matching the capabilities of the human eye, and the other is an experiment in creating a more realistic passthrough by using light fields. This article takes a detailed look at both prototypes. Videos demonstrating the capabilities of both headsets are available in the article.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Superconductor Breakthrough Replicated, Twice (4 minute read)](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/superconductor-breakthrough-replicated-twice?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Two separate sources have confirmed that a compound called LK-99 can enable the fabrication of room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductors. A superconductor that could work in everyday devices would improve most aspects of those devices without any electricity waste in the form of heat. While the material is now confirmed to be real, the manufacturing process still needs further refinements to produce more consistent and higher quality results. A link to a video from Chinese researchers showing proof of LK-99's superconducting capabilities is available in the article.

[### A Room-Temperature Superconductor? New Developments (10 minute read)](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/room-temperature-superconductor-new-developments?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Korean scientists claiming to have created a well-above-room-temperature superconducting material at ambient pressure may have achieved one of the most sought-after goals in all of materials science and condensed matter physics. The preparation for the material was not very complicated and it didn't require any particularly exotic materials or equipment, so it was expected that many labs would immediately try to reproduce it. This article covers the latest developments from groups that have replicated the process and analyzes their results. The material may be the most believable shot at room-temperature-and-pressure superconductivity the world has seen yet.

Generative AI is going to change the way educators assess students. It will still be possible to assess students through essays and assignments, but teachers will have to focus on the process rather than the finished result. Assessing how students arrive at an answer makes it harder for students to cheat and it also helps with learning. Teachers may need to devise questions where the answering process can't be simulated.

[### Nvidia H100 GPUs: Supply and Demand (28 minute read)](https://gpus.llm-utils.org/nvidia-h100-gpus-supply-and-demand/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI may be being bottlenecked by the supply of GPUs. The shortage is causing all kinds of limits on product rollouts and model training. Things will accelerate once supply meets demand. This article looks at what is causing the bottleneck, how long it will last, and what would help resolve it.
