The Crew Health Performance Exploration Analog (CHAPEA) is an experiment to see what it will be like for four crew members to live on Mars for a year. The crew will live in a housing unit constructed using a massive 3D printer and conduct experiments, grow food, exercise, and be tested regularly. The first mission to Mars, which NASA is hoping will happen as early as the 2030s, could be a nine-month trip one way and it would take astronauts two and a half years before they start their trip home. The four crew members will start the CHAPEA experiment in June. Pictures of the habitat are available in the article.
