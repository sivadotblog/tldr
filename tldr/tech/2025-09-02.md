### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Teaching AI How Science Actually Works (18 minute read)](https://ifp.org/teaching-ai-how-science-actually-works/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Current AI for science consists of specialized tools built on curated data sets, but much of science is hands-on experimentation and unrecorded tacit knowledge. AI scientists will need multimodal datasets that capture that tacit knowledge for them to become truly capable. The IFP has proposed an effort to generate and use the multimodal data necessary to unlock the full potential of AI for science. The program involves creating a lab that would simultaneously conduct research while recording everything and then using that data to make the whole process more productive.

[### The largest project in the history of humanity is about to enter a key phase: the final assembly of the reactor core, led by an American giant (7 minute read)](https://evidencenetwork.ca/the-largest-project-in-the-history-of-humanity-is-about-to-enter-a-key-phase-the-final-assembly-of-the-reactor-core-led-by-an-american-giant/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Westinghouse Electric Company has secured a ‚Ç¨168 million contract to lead the assembly of the core of ITER's fusion reactor. The critical operation will involve the precise installation and welding of nine massive steel sectors to form the tokamak's vacuum vessel, the heart of the fusion reactor. Each 400-ton sector must be positioned and welded with millimeter precision to create a perfectly circular, hermetically sealed chamber. ITER's primary technical goal is to demonstrate fusion power at a commercial scale. If successful, the project is expected to spawn multiple approaches to commercial fusion.

[### Ripple (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/trueadm/ripple?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Ripple is a TypeScript UI framework that combines the best parts of React, Solid, and Svelte into one package. It was designed to be a JavaScript/TypeScript-first framework, rather than HTML-first. Ripple has its own superset language that plays nicely with TypeScript and JavaScript, but with an interesting touch that leads to a better developer experience for both humans and large language models. It is still in an early development stage.

[### Lessons on building an AI data analyst (12 minute read)](https://www.pedronasc.com/articles/lessons-building-ai-data-analyst?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

[### Thoughts on (Amazonian) Leadership (6 minute read)](https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2025-09-01-Thoughts-on-Amazonian-Leadership.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon's Leadership Principles are famous in the tech world. They're generally sensible rules by which to run a company. The principles include Customer Obsession, starting with the customer and working backwards; Ownership, thinking long term that not sacrificing long-term value for short-term results and acting on behalf of the company, not just your own team; and Bias for Action, making fast decisions and being aware that many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. This article provides some commentary on these principles.

[### Where are all the trillion dollar biotechs? (28 minute read)](https://www.ladanuzhna.xyz/writing/trillion-dollar-biotechs?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The drug development industry addresses the most tractable diseases with the biggest outcomes first. However, unlike with other industries, reinvesting capital from early wins back into the ecosystem hasn't accelerated the industry's progress - it has been on a reverse trend for a while now. For the industry to advance, manufacturing and trials need to get cheaper with each run, regulations should become more adaptive, approval frameworks should increase and not decrease in variance, and new therapeutic modalities should focus on unlocking new biology. Until these new paradigms take hold, it will be difficult to build a trillion-dollar biotech.
