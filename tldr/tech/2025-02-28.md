[### OpenAI unveils GPT-4.5 ‚ÄòOrion,' its largest AI model yet (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/openai-unveils-gpt-4-5-orion-its-largest-ai-model-yet/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is now rolling out GPT-4.5 to ChatGPT Pro subscribers and developers on paid tiers of the company's API. Other users should get the model sometime next week. GPT-4.5 is so expensive to run that OpenAI is evaluating whether to continue serving the model on its API in the long term. It currently costs $75 for every million input tokens and $150 for every million output tokens. This article looks at how the new model compares to OpenAI's other offerings.

Meta intends to debut a standalone Meta AI app during the second quarter. The service is currently only available to users via a website and the company's other apps. Users could potentially interact more deeply with the digital assistant if it were available as a standalone app. Meta also plans to test a paid subscription for Meta AI.

[### Anti-Aging Pill for Dogs Certified as 'Effective' by FDA. But Could It Work for Humans, Too? (3 minute read)](https://people.com/anti-aging-pill-for-dogs-one-step-closer-to-being-on-the-market-11687470?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Biotech startup Loyal has received a certification from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) saying its anti-aging pill for dogs has a reasonable expectation of efficacy. The pill still needs to be certified by the FDA that it is safe for use and can be manufactured at a greater scale before it can be prescribed by veterinarians. Loyal plans to earn conditional approval from the FDA by the end of the year.

Figure plans to begin alpha testing its Figure 02 robot in the home later this year. The project's timeline was accelerated thanks to the company's 'generalist' Vision-Language-Action model, Helix. Helix is designed to process both visual data and natural language input to accelerate learning. It can orchestrate two robots working on a single task in tandem.

[### Dear Student: Yes, AI is here, you're screwed unless you take action... (21 minute read)](https://ghuntley.com/screwed/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

AI will soon start having a large impact on software engineering. Students should start learning fundamentals that universities typically don't teach and obtain skills that are going to be highly desirable to every employer. Developers need to learn how their work directly translates to business value and build a public profile. Software engineers will be fine, as long as they take action now.

superglue is a self-healing open source data connector that can be deployed as a proxy so developers always get the data they want in the format they expect. Developers just define their desired data schemas and provide basic instructions about an API endpoint - superglue automatically generates the API configuration, handles pagination, authentication, and error retries, transforms response data into the exact schema developers want using JSONata expressions, and validates that data, fixing transformations when they break.
