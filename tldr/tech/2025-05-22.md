[### Tesla posts Optimus' most impressive video demonstration yet (2 minute read)](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-optimus-most-impressive-demonstration-video/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Tesla Optimus team's latest video demonstration shows the humanoid robot performing a variety of tasks, including household using a broom and vacuum cleaner, tearing a paper towel, stirring a pot of food, opening a cabinet, closing a curtain, and picking up a Model X fore link and placing it on a dolly. The robot completed all these tasks through a single neural network. It learned its actions using data from first-person videos of humans performing similar tasks. The system could pave the way for Optimus to learn and refine new skills quickly and reliably. The video is available in the article.

[### Jony Ive to lead OpenAI's design work following $6.5B acquisition of his company (4 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/jony-ive-to-lead-openais-design-work-following-6-5b-acquisition-of-his-company/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI is acquiring Jony Ive's startup, io, in an all-equity deal that values the startup at $6.5 billion. Ive and his design firm, LoveFrom, which will continue to operate independently, will now lead creative and design work at OpenAI. He could help OpenAI directly compete with Apple in the consumer hardware space - Apple has struggled to develop AI features that keep up with the latest technology. io's staff of around 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists, and product development specialists will join OpenAI. They will be tasked with developing AI-powered consumer devices and other projects.

[### For Algorithms, a Little Memory Outweighs a Lot of Time (27 minute read)](https://www.quantamagazine.org/for-algorithms-a-little-memory-outweighs-a-lot-of-time-20250521/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Ryan Williams, a theoretical computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recently posted a proof online on the relationship between time and memory in computing. The proof, which showed that memory was more powerful than computer scientists had previously believed, established a mathematical procedure for transforming any algorithm, no matter what it does, into a form that uses much less space. It also implies there are calculations that can't be computed in certain amounts of time, offering a new way to attack one of the oldest open problems in computer science.

[### The small robot company with big global ambitions (6 minute read)](https://restofworld.org/2025/colombia-robotcom-global-robotics-expansion/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feeds)

Robot.com is a Colombian robotic company with a fleet of over 500 robots working in warehouse logistics, advertising displays, security, inspection, and deliveries. The company signed a multi-year partnership with Amazon Web Services last year, catapulting it into the big league of the global service robots market. The steady growth of the company underscores the potential of the robotics industry in Latin America, but it also highlights the challenges of regions with high production costs, limited investor confidence, and minimal public investment.

[### Tesla's head of self-driving admits ‚Äòlagging a couple years' behind Waymo (4 minute read)](https://electrek.co/2025/05/21/tesla-head-self-driving-admits-lagging-a-couple-years-behind-waymo/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla's head of AI and self-driving, Ashok Elluswamy, recently admitted in an interview that the automaker's autonomous program is lagging a couple of years behind Waymo's. However, Tesla's approach is much cheaper, and its cost advantage will allow the company to scale faster. Tesla produces over a million cars a year, versus Waymo's few hundred units, and it plans to use the same vehicles for its autonomous riding service. The company is still limited to a level 2 advanced driver system, which requires constant supervision from the driver, while Waymo has been providing customers with level 4 autonomous driving rides for years. It plans to start offering level 4 autonomous rides to customers in Austin next month.

Google is getting back into the smart glasses game. The company has announced a partnership with Warby Parker - they plan to launch a series of smart glasses built on top of Google's Android XR as soon as next year. The rise of generative AI has allowed Google to revisit the idea of Google Glass, a wearable it launched in 2013 that failed partly due to a technology gap. The company has learned many lessons since the failed launch. Other companies, like Meta and Apple, are also reportedly working on smart glasses.
