Up to 18 children from the UK, Spain, and the US are being recruited for the world's first trial of a gene therapy to cure auditory neuropathy, a condition caused by the disruption of nerve impulses traveling from the inner ear to the brain. The condition can be caused by a variation in a single gene that produces a protein that allows inner hair cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve. The study aims to deliver a working copy of the gene using a modified non-pathogenic virus. Participants will be monitored for five years to gauge whether the treatment works.

[### What to expect from IEDM 2023 this December (5 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/iedm?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The 69th Annual IEEE International Electron Device Meeting is set to start on December 9. This article presents a teaser of some of the technologies that will be presented at the conference. Chip companies can no longer keep on increasing transistor density by scaling down chip features in two dimensions, so they are now stacking chips on top of each other and building transistors on top of each other within chips. Many of these technologies will likely serve machine learning, an application with an ever-growing need for more processing power.

[### CSS relative color syntax (17 minute read)](https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/css-relative-color-syntax/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Relative color syntax is a powerful color feature from CSS Color Level 4 in Chrome 119. It creates a smooth path for color manipulation within CSS and offers ways to lighten, darken, saturate, desaturate, and more. Relative color syntax can be used to create a brand color with any color space or syntax and create half opacity variants with much less code. It makes it easy to read the intent of styles and systems. This post helps readers learn the syntax by demonstrating common color manipulations.
