[### StabilityAI announced AI Music Generator Harmonai based on Dance Diffusion Model (2 minute read)](https://mpost.io/stabilityai-announced-ai-music-generator-harmonai-based-on-dance-diffusion-model/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Harmonai is an organization that publishes open-source generative audio tools to make music production more approachable. Its tools use a process called diffusion, which refines random white noise into sounds based on a pre-trained model with millions of parameters. Harmonai's publicly available Dance Diffusion model can generate up to three seconds of audio. Users can supply their own audio files to train the model or use one of the six pre-trained models available. Examples of audio generated with the model are available in the article.

[### Meta‚Äôs flagship metaverse app is too buggy and employees are barely using it (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23391895/meta-facebook-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-too-buggy-leaked-memo?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Meta's Horizon Worlds, its flagship metaverse app, has too many quality issues and even its building team isn't using it very much. The team has been put on quality lockdown for the rest of the year to fix the problems before the app is opened up to more users. The platform was released in VR in December last year and a web version is supposed to be coming soon. Mark Zuckerberg will share major updates to Horizon and its avatar graphics at Meta's annual Connect conference on October 11.

[### How Open Source is eating AI (16 minute read)](https://lspace.swyx.io/p/open-source-ai?utm_source=twitter&amp;sd=pf?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While researchers and well-funded teams are very good at producing new foundational models, it is the open source community that has come up with the best use cases and optimization for these models. Open sourcing AI models is accelerating development. Stable Diffusion, which required 48GB VRAM to run just over a month ago, has now been optimized to run on a mobile device. Open sourcing improves documentation, UI, and accessibility and creates new use cases. The future of open-sourced AI will depend on economic incentives, licensing, and infrastructure.

Remote work has given rise to new types of working patterns. Some workers are breaking up their work days into smaller blocks, doing tasks whenever works best for them. They are crafting their work schedules around their personal lives. Non-linear workdays are set to take a more prominent role in some jobs and sectors. Experts believe there are many benefits to working asynchronously, as long as certain measures are in place.
