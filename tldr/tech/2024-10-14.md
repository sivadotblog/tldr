[### SpaceX's Starship test completes with a remarkable ‚Äòchopstick' booster catch (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/13/24269029/spacex-starship-launch-super-heavy-chopstick-launch-tower-return-fifth-flight-test?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SpaceX's Super Heavy booster was caught by a launch tower using arms that the company has nicknamed the 'chopsticks' at the completion of Starship's fifth flight test yesterday. The remarkable catch was an important step towards making the Super Heavy booster a fully reusable launch system. Starship splashed down in the Indian Ocean a little over an hour after launch. A short clip of the booster being caught by the launch tower is available in the article.

[### WordPress.org's latest move involves taking control of a WP Engine plugin (1 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/12/24268637/wordpress-org-matt-mullenweg-acf-fork-secure-custom-fields-wp-engine?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

WordPress.org has taken over the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin, a popular WP Engine plugin. It claims the move was intended to remove commercial upsells and fix a security problem. WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg claims that the move was related to WP Engine's recently-filed lawsuit against him and Automattic. Those who aren't WP Engine, Flywheel, or ACF Pro customers will need to go to the ACF site and download the genuine 6.3.8 version to keep getting updates.

Lucid dreams could unlock new dimensions of communication. Researchers at REMspace recently demonstrated that people can communicate in their dreams. Participants in REMspace's study were able to send and receive messages through a server that recorded their brain waves and other polysomnographic data during REM sleep. The company plans to release a device that accurately tracks all sleep stages for customers to view on a mobile app by 2025.

Waves tend to flow equally in both directions. This can cause interference, garbling signals or reducing efficiency. Researchers at ETH Zurich have figured out how to direct sound waves so that they only travel forward without weakening the sound's strength. This feat could have vast implications for future technologies, from communications systems to radar.

[### Machines of Loving Grace (2 hour read)](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

In this post, Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, talks about how AI could transform the world for the better. He sketches out what the world might look like with a powerful AI if everything goes right. The effects of powerful AI are likely to be even more unpredictable than past technological changes. The list of positive applications of powerful AI is extremely long - this post focuses on a small number of areas that have the greatest potential to directly improve the quality of human life.

[### Have We Reached Peak Human Life Span? (4 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/well/live/average-human-life-span.html?unlocked_article_code=1.R04.P5PG.mqt5_ilnfWPg&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While life expectancies have generally increased in the last few decades, the rate at which they are increasing is slowing down. This suggests that humans could be closing in on the limits of what's possible for average life span. The only thing that might radically lengthen life expectancy may be an intervention that slows the aging process itself, something some scientists are optimistic about.
