[### Tesla has been testing a robotaxi service in the Bay Area for most of the year (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24278056/tesla-robotaxi-ride-hailing-test-employees?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Elon Musk revealed during Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday that the company has been testing a robotaxi service in the Bay Area. Tesla employees have been able to summon an autonomously operated Tesla vehicle for trips using the company's prototype ride-hailing app for the past few months. The vehicles are operating using the latest version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving software, which Musk claims will be 1,000 times better than human driving by the second quarter of 2025. Musk says that he expects to roll out a paid ridehailing service in California and Texas starting next year, pending regulatory approval.

The New Glenn launch vehicle will be able to lift up to 45,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit, double that of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. It is designed to be partly reusable. New Glenn's first launch attempt is slated for November. The company aims to land New Glenn on its very first launch.

[### Using Rust in Non-Rust Servers to Improve Performance (22 minute read)](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/blob/master/posts/rust-in-non-rust-servers.md?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article discusses different strategies for incrementally adding Rust into a searcher written in another language. Developers may want to do this if they identify functions not meeting their performance requirements because they're being bottlenecked by the CPU and the usual techniques of memoizing the function or improving its algorithm aren't feasible or effective. Sometimes, it's worth investigating swapping out the function implementation for something written in a more CPU-efficient language - like Rust.

[### You Should Probably Pay Attention to Tokenizers (14 minute read)](https://cybernetist.com/2024/10/21/you-should-probably-pay-attention-to-tokenizers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tokenization is the process of breaking down a piece of text into smaller pieces called tokens. These tokens are then assigned an integer value for identification within the tokenizer vocabulary, a set of all possible tokens used in the tokenizer training. There are different types of tokenizers. It's a good idea to be aware of which one is used by the large language model you are trying to use. This article discusses the different types of tokenizers and how they can influence processing.

[### Arm cancels Qualcomm's architecture license, endangering its chip business (2 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/report-arm-cancels-qualcomms-architecture-license-endangering-its-chip-business/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Arm has canceled Qualcomm's license for making Arm chips as part of an escalation of a fight that began in late 2022 when Arm sued Qualcomm over its acquisition of Nuvia in 2021. Qualcomm has 60 days before it will be forced to stop manufacturing and selling its Arm chips. It bought Nuvia to assist with developing high-performance Arm chips, but Arm claimed the acquisition caused Nuvia to breach its Arm licenses. Arm demanded that Qualcomm and Nuvia destroy any designs that Nuvia had created pre-acquisition, but the companies didn't comply. Qualcomm's shift to using Nuvia's designs means that Arm could make less money from the partnership than it used to.

[### Former OpenAI Staffer Says the Company Is Breaking Copyright Law and Destroying the Internet (2 minute read)](https://gizmodo.com/former-openai-staffer-says-the-company-is-breaking-copyright-law-and-destroying-the-internet-2000515721?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Suchir Balaji, a former researcher at OpenAI, recently wrote in his personal blog that he believes the company is not complying with US copyright law, adding to the growing number of voices that say the company's giant data scraping business is based on shaky legal ground. Balaji worked at OpenAI for four years before leaving this summer. He says that AI companies are destroying the commercial viability of the individuals, businesses, and internet services that created the digital data used to train AI systems. OpenAI claims it builds its AI models using publicly available data in a legal and fair way. The company is currently dealing with multiple lawsuits for its use of copyright material.
