Manual testing on mobile devices is too slow and too limited. It forces teams to cut releases a week early just to test before submitting them to app stores. And without broad device coverage, issues slip through.

### Big Tech & Startups

[### OpenAI's new open weight (Apache 2) models are really good (15 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/5/gpt-oss/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's long-awaited open weight models have been released. The 120B model achieves near-party with OpenAI o4-mini on core reasoning benchmarks while running efficiently on a single 80 GB GPU. The 20B model delivers similar results to OpenAI o3-mini on common benchmarks and can run on edge devices with just 16 GB of memory. Both models are mixture-of-experts. It is likely that OpenAI now offers the best available open weights models.

[### Anthropic Unveils More Powerful AI Model Ahead of Rival GPT-5 Release (2 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-05/anthropic-unveils-more-powerful-model-ahead-of-gpt-5-release?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NDQ1NTczMiwiZXhwIjoxNzU1MDYwNTMyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMEo0SVdHUFdDTDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBOEExRDhFQTI5OTc0OTRGQTQ1QUE2REJBMjAwNTM3MSJ9.aCDToBLIm5AdB2ObtvcpoxYTv2QLHTA5BOos29cOYjc&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Anthropic's new model, Opus 4.1, is more capable at coding, research, and data analysis and better at fielding complex multistep problems than previous versions. It can better navigate large codebases and make more precise modifications to code. Opus 4.1 scores two percentage points higher than its predecessor on SWE-Bench Verified, a popular coding evaluation benchmark. Anthropic is currently finalizing a deal to raise as much as $5 billion in a new funding round at a valuation of $170 billion.

[### Ozempic Shows Anti-Aging Effects in First Clinical Trial, Reversing Biological Age by 3.1 Years (3 minute read)](https://trial.medpath.com/news/5c43f09ebb6d0f8e/ozempic-shows-anti-aging-effects-in-first-clinical-trial-reversing-biological-age-by-3-1-years?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Ozempic demonstrated remarkable anti-agent effects in a randomized controlled trial involving 108 people with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy, a condition characterized by excess fat accumulation and accelerated cellular aging. The researchers used epigenetic clocks to assess biological aging and found that those on semaglutide became 3.1 years biologically younger on average by the end of the study. The anti-aging effects weren't uniform across all body systems - the most dramatic improvements occurred in the inflammatory system and brain. The researchers believe that the anti-aging properties of semaglutide stem from its effects on fat distribution and metabolic health.

[### First Evidence of Microplastic Mobilization in a Human Subject ‚Äì A Self-Experiment (17 minute read)](https://jonbrudvig.substack.com/p/first-evidence-of-microplastic-mobilization?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microplastics are everywhere. Studies show that microplastic burden strongly correlates with negative health outcomes. This post presents an experimental protocol that tricks cells into releasing microplastics back into the blood, where they can be transported to the liver for biliary excretion or actively removed with plasma exchange. It involves using a compound derived from broccoli as a microplastics mobilizer.

[### stagewise (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/stagewise-io/stagewise?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

stagewise is a frontend coding agent for production codebases. Developers just have to tell the agent what they want to change, click on elements to let the agent know where a change should happen, and then stagewise does the rest. stagewise can be customized with plugins, and it is compatible with all kinds of frameworks. It features a dedicated frontend agent, but developers can use any other compatible agent through stagewise's open agent interface.

[### Adopting Claude Code: Riding the Software Economics Singularity (12 minute read)](https://preset.io/blog/adopting-claude-code-riding-the-software-economics-singularity/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Programming is quickly changing. Claude Code fundamentally changed what is possible when working at scale. AI has removed a lot of friction in the development process, allowing tasks that weren't worth tackling before to be completed. However, when coding speed stops being the limiting factor, new bottlenecks emerge. The constraint now isn't how fast features can be implemented, it's how quickly decisions can be made about what to build.

Google DeepMind's Genie 3 model can create interactive worlds from prompts or images. It can create continuously generated environments that can be changed on the fly. The ability to create alterable 3D environments could make games more dynamic for players and offer developers new ways to prove out concepts and level designs. Examples of environments generated by the model are available in the article.
