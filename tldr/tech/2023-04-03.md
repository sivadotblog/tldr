[### Today's old folks set to smash through longevity records (3 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/31/age_longevity_records/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A new study suggests that people born between 1910 and 1950 have the potential to expand the 'human mortality plateau', the point at which life expectancy typically levels off, by a decade. The plateau has been relatively unchanged for centuries. The first increase was observed in the second half of the 19th century, when the plateau jumped by five years, likely due to improvements in public health and medical technology. The study indicates that the human body's true biological limit has still not been reached.

[### He who submits a resume has already lost (10 minute read)](https://www.residentcontrarian.com/p/he-who-submits-a-resume-has-already?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The resume-first hiring process primarily benefits the employer. All of the obligations are on the applicant's side and there are no guarantees of any benefit. Applicants are often left waiting, uncertain, and without even a rejection email. The normal resume-first process is a lottery, with resumes functioning as raffle tickets to access the actual hiring process. Many people take networking seriously as it is often the best way to find a good job.

[### GPT-4 Is a Reasoning Engine (8 minute read)](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-4-is-a-reasoning-engine?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The key components of thinking are reasoning and knowledge. Without reasoning, knowledge is useless, and without knowledge, reasoning can become a confident fabrication. The AI models we have today are limited by their lack of knowledge, even though they are trained on vast amounts of data. They are primarily reasoning engines, not knowledge databases. The progress of AI will likely be driven by its ability to access relevant knowledge in real-time.
