[### Elon Musk's Neuralink Joins Study Working Toward a Bionic Eye (1 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-25/elon-musk-s-neuralink-joins-study-working-toward-a-bionic-eye?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MzY1NDI2MCwiZXhwIjoxNzU0MjU5MDYwLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWllWUzhHUEwzWE8wMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBOEExRDhFQTI5OTc0OTRGQTQ1QUE2REJBMjAwNTM3MSJ9.IlmD0ekOvE4Y1KTgHE1nXZh011fYOtUNdPrGMDQi2Uw&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Neuralink is collaborating with researchers in California and Spain on a clinical trial to study visual prosthetics. The study, sponsored by the University of California at Santa Barbara, aims to address the fundamental questions that will allow the development of a Smart Bionic Eye. Such a device would use AI to help blind people identify faces, navigate the outdoors, and read, among other things. The study's description says that researchers will use Neuralink patients 'once available'. Neuralink is developing a brainchip called Blindsight that aims to restore vision to blind people and grant superhuman vision.

[### The first 100% effective HIV prevention drug is approved and going global (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/infectious-diseases/hiv-prevention-fda-lenacapavir/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The US Food and Drug Administration has approved lenacapavir, a drug that offers 100% protection against HIV with twice-yearly injections. Sold under the brand name Yeztugo, lenacapavir is a capsid inhibitor. It stops the virus from entering cells and copying itself. Gilead has made moves to ensure the drug is affordable - eligible uninsured individuals will likely be able to access the drug free of cost through its Advancing Access medication assistance program. üíª

Unitree Robotics's R1 bot has a starting price of 39,900 yuan, or around $5,900. Weighing just 25 kilograms, it has 26 joints and is equipped with multimodal artificial intelligence, including voice in image recognition. If it works as advertised, the new robot marks a milestone for the robotics industry. Chinese companies are pushing ahead with humanoids for factories, households, and even military use - pricing is crucial to their proliferation.

[### An Engineer's Guide to AI Code Model Evals (30 minute read)](https://addyosmani.com/blog/ai-evals/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A crucial part of the process of improving a coding-capable AI model is evaluation (evals). Evals are structured tests or benchmarks used to measure model performance on specific tasks. They are analogous to unit tests or integration tests in software. This post explores what evals are, how they're constructed, what 'hill climbing' means in model development, and how all these pieces connect to the continuous training and improvement of coding models.

The estimated growth in energy required for AI is currently unsustainable. Several startups and companies are experimenting with new kinds of chips that have the potential to be much more energy efficient than current industry leaders at the all-important task of inference. While Nvidia chips will continue to be used for AI training for the foreseeable future, more efficient inference could collectively save companies tens of billions of dollars. The intensity of these chip development efforts shows how desperate the tech world is to provide AI to customers without paying the 'Nvidia tax'.
