[### Vision-based AI drones outfly world-class human pilots (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/zurich-autonomous-drone-race?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A trio of champion drone racers recently faced off against vision-based AI drones in a race and lost. The drones used onboard vision systems and their own computers to fly. They did not have the aid of motion-capture systems or off-board computers. Motion capture systems can provide near-perfect state estimation, making a race between humans and AI completely unfair. Several drone racing clips are available in the article.

[### Electron whirlpools: Scientists witness electricity behaving like water (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/physics/electron-whirlpools-fluid-flow-electricity/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at MIT have observed electron whirlpools for the first time in crystals of tungsten ditelluride. Electricity is made up of discrete particles, and it can flow with the viscosity of honey under the right conditions. Tungsten ditelluride is a new quantum material that allows electrons to strongly interact and behave as quantum waves rather than particles. The study confirmed a long-standing prediction and it could lead to more efficient electronics designs.
