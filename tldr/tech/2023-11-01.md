[### Virtual Superlensing Made a Reality (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/virtual-superlensing?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Superlensing is a way to see things that are smaller than the wavelength of light. Two researchers from the University of Sydney Nano Institute recently developed a superlensing technique that doesn't require any actual lenses. They achieved this by using calculations on electromagnetic field recordings. While the method is not the first nor the highest resolution technique available, it is much faster and less costly than other techniques.

[### Open-access reformers launch next bold publishing plan (11 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03342-6?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A group of influential funding agencies called cOAlition S has been pushing for change in the scholarly publishing world over the past five years by pressuring journals to allow immediate open-access publishing. Its most recent proposal puts forward an even broader transformation in the dissemination of research. The group's new goal is to make all versions of an article and its associated peer-review reports be published openly from the outset without the authors paying any fees and for the authors to decide when and where to first publish their work.

YouTube has recently ramped up its anti-adblock efforts. This article looks at how YouTube is doing this and the efforts from Redditors and adblock extension developers to bypass them. While developers are able to still bypass YouTube's anti-adblocking methods, YouTube will likely win this war through attrition - there is a limit to how much adblock developers can take and YouTube has the resources to continue on forever.
