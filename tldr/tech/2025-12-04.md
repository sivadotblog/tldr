[### Failed software projects are strategic failures (27 minute read)](https://deadsimpletech.com/blog/failed_software_projects?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

You need to know how to formulate a strategy to avoid strategic failure. Decide what your basic goals are, consider your positioning in your environment, and look at your strengths and weaknesses as a strategic entity. As a business, your first sweeping goal is continued survival, followed by maximizing total profitability. Consider different things that you can do in your circumstances to achieve your strategic goals. Organizations can usually only pursue a few goals at once, so set objectives that provide the maximum amount of impact with the available resources.

[### Everyone in Seattle Hates AI (6 minute read)](https://jonready.com/blog/posts/everyone-in-seattle-hates-ai.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tech workers in Seattle tend to react negatively when the topic of AI is brought up. This is due to several reasons, like layoffs due to AI, the proliferation of AI in software, and being forced to use AI tools whether they work or not. The result is that engineers are no longer trying because they think they can't, and companies aren't empowering them because they assume they shouldn't. Bad products are only reinforcing the belief that AI is doomed.
