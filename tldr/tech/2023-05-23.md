[### OpenAI leaders propose international regulatory body for AI (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/22/openai-leaders-propose-international-regulatory-body-for-ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's leadership believes that the world needs an international regulatory body to govern AI. They say that the pace of innovation is so fast that existing authorities are unable to adequately rein in the technology. While an AI-governing body may not be able to flip the switch on a bad actor, it can at least establish and track international standards and agreements. Companies are unlikely to self-regulate - even OpenAI plans to continue developing the technology due to its enormous potential.

[### Amazon employees plan to walk off the job as tech worker tension rises (8 minute read)](https://archive.ph/uvMQ9?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Some employees at Amazon's Seattle headquarters are planning a walkout on May 31. The protest was organized in response to the frustration over layoffs and the return-to-office mandate. There are also some concerns over Amazon's climate commitments. Walkout organizers are hoping to draw at least 1,000 participants to the protest. Employees report that morale in the company is at an all-time low.

[### Hypersensitive robot hand is eerily human in how it can feel things (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/hypersensitive-robot-hand-is-eerily-human-in-how-it-can-feel-things/?comments=1&amp;comments-page=1?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team of researchers at Columbia University has developed a robot hand with a level of sensitivity and dexterity high enough to feel and handle things as humans do. The team integrated multiple types of machine learning to give the robot hand its abilities. The robot hand is able to feel what it is touching and it can easily reposition its fingers to hold objects better. It can complete tasks in the dark using proprioceptive sensing, something many organisms are capable of. A picture of the robot hand is available in the article.

[### New nontoxic powder uses sunlight to quickly disinfect contaminated drinking water (4 minute read)](https://news.stanford.edu/2023/05/18/new-technology-uses-ordinary-sunlight-disinfect-drinking-water/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists at Stanford University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have invented a powder that can quickly disinfect water when exposed to sunlight. The low-cost, recyclable powder could be a significant advance for nearly 30% of the world's population. It disinfects water in under a minute and can be removed from water using an ordinary magnet and reused. The powder can be used in wastewater treatment plants to save energy.

[### Changing my mind on remote, moving the team back to San Francisco (5 minute read)](https://flocrivello.com/changing-my-mind-on-remote-about-being-in-san-francisco/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

While remote work is more comfortable for workers, it makes it harder for startups to succeed or find product/market fit. Working remotely raises coordination costs. It makes it harder for people to align their thoughts. Building community with workers is important as it creates trust. Network effects drive success for both employees and their companies.

[### The End of Screens? (4 minute read)](https://calnewport.com/the-end-of-screens/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Sightful's Spacetop augmented reality laptop could be the start of a new trend that may lead to a future with no more screens. The laptop is still currently in a beta testing phase and it will likely take years before the technology is ready for mainstream use. Creating virtual monitor space is something that AR could convincingly solve. Once the technology is sufficiently developed, other companies will likely want to create their own versions.
