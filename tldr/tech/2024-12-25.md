[### Google is using Anthropic's Claude to improve its Gemini AI (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/24/google-is-using-anthropics-claude-to-improve-its-gemini-ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google contractors working to improve Gemini are comparing its answers against outputs produced by Anthropic's Claude. It is unknown whether Google has permission for its use of Claude in testing against Gemini. Anthropic's terms of service forbids customers from accessing Claude to build competing products or services or train competing AI models without approval. Google is a major investor in Anthropic.

[### Apple joins Google antitrust fight to protect $20B search partnership (4 minute read)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-joins-google-antitrust-fight-protect-20b-search-partnership?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is seeking to intervene in Google's US antitrust trial over online search, saying that Google can no longer adequately represent its interests in the case. The company has concerns over its multi-billion dollar revenue-sharing agreement with Google. Apple received an estimated $20 billion from Google in 2022 for making Google the default search engine on Safari. The trial could potentially force Google to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system to restore competition in the online search market.

[### NASA spacecraft just plunged into the sun and broke stunning records (6 minute read)](https://mashable.com/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-breaks-record-speed-closest-approach?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The Parker Solar Probe swooped through the Sun's atmosphere early on Christmas Eve. Flying around 3.8 million miles above the solar surface, the probe was designed to explore how solar storms are formed. It is fitted with instruments to measure and image solar winds, which may enable us to better forecast when and where a potent coronal mass ejection or solar flare may hit. Solar storms have huge implications for energy grids and communications systems on Earth.

The Unitree B2-W robot dog can now do handstands thanks to a few upgrades, including high-powered wheel motors, M107 joint modules, and replaceable wheel/foot legs. It is equipped with a 32 wire automotive-grade LiDAR, a depth camera, and an ultra large 2200Wh battery, and can achieve a top speed of 12.4 miles per hour. It can travel 31 miles with an 88 pound load and pull up to 220 pounds. A video of the robot dog performing tricks is available in the article.

[### Ask HN: Programmers who don't use autocomplete/LSP, how do you do it? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42492508&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Many IDE features, like autocomplete, language servers, and Copilot, can be taken for granted today. However, not every developer uses these tools. Some developers work in environments where they aren't able to access IDEs (for example, on remote servers that only have Vim), so they have had to learn different ways of doing things. Organizing software in a way where every piece of code has a clear and logical place is a skill - tooling that helps with code navigation can result in code that lacks structure.

[### How to (hopefully ethically) make money off of AGI (38 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CTBta9i8sav7tjC2r/how-to-hopefully-ethically-make-money-off-of-agi?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article contains an interview with Will Eden from Cosmos, Zvi Mowshowitz (an economist who spent 2.5 years trading at Jane Street Capital), and Noah Kreutter, who has roughly four years of quant-y finance experience at IMC and Bridgewater. The interview covers how to construct a portfolio that will go well when Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) becomes a bigger deal, the broad market effects of AGI, career capital in an AGI world, debt in interest effect of AGI, and much more. The interview was in November last year - the interviewer recently posted an update showing that the investment advice in the interview backtested well.

[### I sensed anxiety and frustration at NeurIPS'24 (13 minute read)](https://kyunghyuncho.me/i-sensed-anxiety-and-frustration-at-neurips24/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Late-year PhD students and postdocs at NeurIPS'24 expressed anxiety and frustration as the job market looks and feels very different from what they expected when they were applying for PhD programs five or so years ago. Years ago, competition for artificial intelligence researchers with PhDs was fierce - companies were recruiting them to prepare themselves for a revolution. Many of the researchers, who were paid well, were free to choose what they wanted to work on and publish whatever they wanted to publish. This incentivized a large number of brilliant students to apply to PhD programs. Universities have started to train undergraduate, graduate, and master's students on these technologies, making PhDs less valuable to companies.
