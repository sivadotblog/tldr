[### Eric Schmidt joins Relativity Space as CEO (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/eric-schmidt-joins-relativity-space-as-ceo/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google's former CEO Eric Schmidt is now CEO of Relativity Space, a 9-year-old rocket startup - this is Schmidt's first CEO job since he left Google nearly 15 years ago. Schmidt has made a significant investment in Relativity Space and has a controlling stake in the company. Tim Ellis, co-founder and former CEO of Relativity Space, will continue to support the company as a director on the company's board. Relativity Space is gearing up for the launch of its Terran R rocket, scheduled for 2026. The company has so far struck nearly $3 billion in launch contracts with customers.

Apple is planning to transform the interface for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac for a new generation of users later this year. The revamp will fundamentally change the look of Apple's operating systems and make the company's software platforms more consistent. The company is working to simplify the way users navigate and control their devices. The new design is loosely based on the Vision Pro's software. Apple is betting that a breakthrough new interface will help spur demand after a dip in sales.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Microplastics hinder plant photosynthesis, study finds, threatening millions with starvation (3 minute read)](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/10/microplastics-hinder-plant-photosynthesis-study-finds-threatening-millions-with-starvation?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microplastic pollution is significantly cutting food supplies by damaging plants' ability to photosynthesize. Between 4% to 14% of the world's staple crops are currently estimated to be lost due to the pervasive particles. The effect could get worse as more microplastics enter the environment. The world is already facing a challenge to produce sufficient food sustainably, and it is also facing crop losses due to climate change. These adverse effects are highly likely to extend from food security to planetary health - reduced photosynthesis may also cut the amount of carbon dioxide taken from the atmosphere.

[### Ozempic's New Frontier: The War on Aging (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/ozempic-weight-loss-drug-aging-health-benefits-d93a22f8?st=AWFAgW&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A growing body of research indicates that GLP-1 drugs, like Ozempic, show promise in preventing age-related conditions like Alzheimer's, osteoarthritis, and certain cancers. The class of drugs works by suppressing appetite and reducing inflammation, which may potentially contribute to their preventive health benefits. More robust studies are still needed to confirm the causal effects of GLP-1s on longevity and healthspan.

[### Claude Code is expensive, reckless, and weirdly fun (5 minute read)](https://rafaelquintanilha.com/is-claude-code-worth-the-hype-or-just-expensive-vibe-coding/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cursor is the clear winner when precise context is crucial, but Claude Code excels in vibe coding. Vibe coding is when you interact more than you read or write code - it is a development mode that is somewhat reckless, but fun. This approach gets expensive, but it is far less cognitively intense. Claude Code excels at boring tasks and at extending features, but due to lower supervision by design, it suits smaller or less critical projects at best. It is relatively expensive compared to more comprehensive tools.

[### I quit my FAANG job because it'll be automated by the end of 2025 (3 minute read)](https://jagilley.github.io/faang-blog.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The evidence points to a scenario where engineering and other pure knowledge works will soon be mostly done by AI agents. Those who formerly held jobs that AI took over will act as AI agent wranglers. There are still factors of production other than intelligence, many that are intrinsically tied to being a human, that should retain economic value. There are many jobs that, even if they could be done very well by AI systems, people wouldn't want to use AI systems to do them, for example, sales.

[### The Model is the Product (8 minute read)](https://vintagedata.org/blog/posts/model-is-the-product?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Generalist scaling is stalling, opinionated training is working much better than expected, and inference costs are in free fall. Investors have been betting on the application layer, which is likely to be the first to be automated in disrupted in the next stage of AI evolution. AI companies that form a complete upstream and downstream industrial ecosystem will not need to make their own applications. Big labs will likely shift partnerships from API customers to contractors involved in the earlier training stage.

[### How the AI Talent Race Is Reshaping the Tech Job Market (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-the-ai-talent-race-is-reshaping-the-tech-job-market-93df0615?st=9Vjc4k&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The debut of ChatGPT was a turning point for the AI job market. Many more companies became aware of the power of integrating AI into products and workflows. New AI-related postings rose 68% between the time ChatGPT was released through to the end of last year while tech postings were down 27% over the same period. Engineers without AI skills can still fare well in the job market, but AI skills tend to fetch premium pay and job security.
