[### Forget everything you know about SSH and try Tailscale (Sponsor)](https://tailscale.com/tailscale-ssh/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=2022-08-11&amp;utm_term=ssh&amp;utm_content=lp)

Imagine you didn‚Äôt need to manage PKI or rotate SSH keys every time someone leaves. Pretty sweet, right?

With [Tailscale SSH](https://tailscale.com/tailscale-ssh/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2022-08-11&utm_term=SSH&utm_content=lp) you can do exactly that. Tailscale gives each server and user device a node key to connect to its VPN, and uses the same node key for SSH authorization and encryption. Basically, you‚Äôre SSHing the same way you manage app access.

What‚Äôs the benefit? Built-in key rotation, permissions as code, connectivity between any two devices, reduced latency‚Ä¶ ([there‚Äôs more](https://tailscale.com/tailscale-ssh/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2022-08-11&utm_term=SSH&utm_content=lp)). You can also ask users to re-authenticate for that extra bit of security. Sounds expensive? Nope: Tailscale is completely free for personal use on up to 20 devices.
