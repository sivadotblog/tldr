[### RIP Google Hangouts, Google‚Äôs last, best chance to compete with iMessage (8 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/rip-google-hangouts-googles-last-best-chance-to-compete-with-imessage/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google Hangouts has been shut down. Hangouts data has been moved to Google Chat. Google still doesn't have a competitive messaging platform. Hangouts was designed to unify Google's messaging portfolio, allowing users to access all of their communications within a single messaging app in one easy-to-use interface.

[### AlphaFold‚Äôs new rival? Meta AI predicts shape of 600 million proteins (4 minute read)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03539-1?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers at Meta have used a large language model to predict the structures of around 600 million proteins. The data offers the potential for great insight into biology. Large language models are a type of AI that can predict text. Proteins can be expressed as chains of amino acids, so the model basically learned how to 'autocomplete' proteins. Meta's model is less accurate than OpenAI's AlphaFold, but it is about 60 times faster at predicting structures. The predictions and the code underlying the model are available for anyone to use.
