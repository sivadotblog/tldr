Iwaya Giken, a start-up based in Sapporo, Japan, aims to make space tourism available for everyone. It has developed a two-seater cabin and a balloon that will rise 15 miles into the sky. The cabin can carry one pilot and a passenger. The balloon, filled with helium gas, will make the drum-shaped cabin rise up into the air, completing the ascent in about two hours and staying there for an hour. It will then descend for over an hour back to its point of origin. The company aims to lower the boarding price tag from an initial $180,000 to a five-figure cost.

[### ChatML and the ChatGPT API (2 minute read)](https://matt-rickard.com/chatml-chatgpt-api?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI recently launched the ChatGPT API. It is significantly cheaper than its leading competitor, the text-davinci-003 model. Included in the launch is the release of ChatML, a markup language utilized to generate chat experiences via large language models. The ChatGPT API requires structured input provided through ChatML, as opposed to relying on unstructured text. ChatML is important because it is moving the field towards structured input, its use indicates that there is likely more orchestration in the background, and creating a language could create lock-in and differentiate OpenAI from its competitors.

[### Linux desktop powers consider uniting for an app store (3 minute read)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-desktop-powers-consider-uniting-for-an-app-store/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The GNOME Foundation, KDE Foundation, and Debian Linux are considering building an app store on top of Flatpak, a universal Linux software deployment and package management program. Flatpak can run on any Linux distribution by containerizing applications with all the necessary libraries and associated files. The new app store would not only make it easier to find and install programs but will also replace traditional ways of delivering Linux desktop apps. The proposal aims to promote diversity and sustainability in the Linux desktop community by adding payments, donations, and subscriptions to the app store on Flatpak, making it more user and developer-friendly.

The Federal Trade Commission has proposed a new rule that would prohibit most non-compete agreements between employers and workers. The new rule includes restrictive non-disclosure agreements and onerous training reimbursement provisions. The only exception to the ban would be for those selling or disposing of a substantial ownership interest in a business entity. Employers will have 180 days to rescind existing non-competes and notify current and former employees of the rescission. The Proposed Rule has received over 10,000 comments, with many objections. This article contains a summary of the questions and answers from a webinar hosted by BakerHostetler attorneys regarding the new rules.
