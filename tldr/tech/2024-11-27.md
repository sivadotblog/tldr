[### AI's Future and Nvidia's Fortunes Ride on the Race to Pack More Chips Into One Place (3 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidia-chips-ai-race-96d21d09?st=bDdxTx&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The most ambitious players in the AI race are now building super clusters of computer servers that cost billions of dollars and contain unprecedented numbers of Nvidia's most advanced chips. The push towards superclusters could help Nvidia sustain its growth trajectory. The trend is fostering demand for Nvidia's networking equipment, which is fast becoming a significant business. Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which are several times as powerful as its current chips, are set to start shipping in the next couple of months.

[### Artists Leak OpenAI's Sora Video Generator (3 minute read)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/artists-leak-openais-sora-video-generator-in-pr-puppet-protest?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A group of artists recently made a post claiming that OpenAI was using them as unpaid beta testers for Sora, OpenAI's video generator, and that the company was pressuring them to spin a positive narrative around the tool. OpenAI required every video clip to be approved before sharing, suggesting that the early access program was less about creative expression and critique and more about PR and advertisement. The artists leaked a version of Sora on Hugging Face that could create 10-second clips but OpenAI shut down early access for all artists three hours after it was posted. The artists said in their post that they hope OpenAI becomes more open, more artist friendly, and supports the arts beyond PR stunts.

[### NASA's Search for Life: SpaceX to Launch Dragonfly Mission to Saturn's Moon (2 minute read)](https://www.cnet.com/science/space/nasas-search-for-life-spacex-to-launch-dragonfly-mission-to-saturns-moon/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

NASA has announced a $256.6 million contract with SpaceX to support the launch of the Dragonfly mission. Dragonfly is a nuclear-powered spacecraft about the size of a Mars Rover that is capable of flight like a drone. It will be sent to Saturn's moon Titan to characterize the habitability of Titan's environment, investigate the progression of prebiotic chemistry on the moon, and search for chemical indications of whether water-based or hydrocarbon-based life ever existed on the Titan. The mission is expected to launch in July 2028 on SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

China has unveiled a mock-up of a moon colony that shows a handful of egg-shaped gray igloos and space rovers with Lego-like spacemen grounding between them. The model is a result of careful examination of the conditions on the moon, where there is a lack of raw materials, extreme temperature fluctuations, and cosmic radiation. China is planning to establish a permanent base on the moon by 2035 and is developing detailed plans accordingly. Pictures of the model are available in the article.

[### Which IDEs do software engineers love, and why? (20 minute read)](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ide-that-software-engineers-love/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Cursor, an AI-first code editor, is rapidly gaining popularity, with more developers preferring it over VS Code + Copilot or JetBrains IDE + Copilot. It appears most IDE vendors are offering generative AI capabilities at a loss. Engineers making heavy use of code generation are likely getting good value for money in terms of the compute required for code generation on larger codebases. This article looks over the several AI-focused IDEs available and useful features for developers.

[### Google and the DOJ make their final arguments in the ad tech monopoly case (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305748/google-doj-ad-tech-monopoly-closing-arguments?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google and the Department of Justice have made their closing arguments in the antitrust case against Google. The DOJ argued that Google used a suite of ad tech products to strong-arm site owners and advertisers. Google countered that it faces competition from other sources and shouldn't have to cut deals with competitors. US District Court judge Leonie Brinkema is expected to rule on the case by the end of 2024.

[### Building LLMs is probably not going be a brilliant business (6 minute read)](https://calpaterson.com/porter.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Large language models are cool, but that doesn't mean that building them is going to be a profitable business. What makes a good business is industry structure. Airlines have unfavorable industry structure, with only two makers of airplanes, fickle and unloyal customers, and high amounts of competition. The fizzy-drinks business has a very favorable industry structure - fizzy drinks are easy to make, customers aren't very picky, and it isn't easy for new competitors to enter the market. The industry structure for large language model makers isn't very good - there is only one true supplier (Nvidia), there doesn't seem to be any brand loyalty being built up, and there is a lot of competition in the market.
