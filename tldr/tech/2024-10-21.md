[### OpenAI, Microsoft reportedly hire banks to renegotiate partnership terms (2 minute read)](https://siliconangle.com/2024/10/18/openai-microsoft-reportedly-hire-banks-renegotiate-partnership-terms/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI and Microsoft have both hired investment banks to help revise the terms of their partnership as OpenAI plans to restructure to reincorporate its for-profit arm as a benefit corporation and remove caps that previously limited investors' returns. The negotiations are said to focus on how big of a stake Microsoft will receive in OpenAI following the restructuring. Microsoft has invested over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2019. The current terms of the partnership say that Microsoft will receive most of OpenAI's initial profits until it recoups its investment. OpenAI doesn't expect to become profitable until 2029.

Starship is designed to launch at least 150 metric tons to low Earth orbit at an exceptionally low cost with a launch cadence high enough to ultimately deliver over one million metric tons per year. This will transform human logistical capacity in space and allow for greatly reduced space development costs. It would enable humanity to develop a self-assembling and ever-growing telescope in space. This telescope would be able to resolve features on the surface of exoplanets and reveal continents, mountain ranges, river systems, seasonal variations in plants and animals, and more.

[### Did Automattic commit open source theft? (17 minute read)](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/did-automattic-commit-open-source-theft/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Automattic, the VC-funded company behind WordPress, is in a full-blown corporate conflict with WP Engine, a popular managed WordPress hosting service. As part of the conflict, Automattic forked a popular plugin made by WP Engine, replaced the plugin in the plugin directory, and is migrating over 2 million of the plugin's customers silently onto the fork. The reviews for the plugin have remained as if nothing has changed and any reviews pointing out the heist are being actively removed. The silent change, aimed at reducing WP Engine's revenue, broke some production sites. The incident is a nightmare scenario for companies serious about supply chain security - the WordPress.org plugin directory is no longer reliable.

Self-driving cars have won over San Francisco after a rocky start a year and a half ago. The company is currently serving over 100,000 paid rides a week across Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco. It opened its service to everyone in San Francisco this past summer. Waymo rides generally cost slightly more than Uber or Lyft, but users don't have to tip drivers, making the three apps' prices competitive. The company is already retaining riders at a higher rate than competitors while operating on a much smaller scale.
