[### OpenAI's Most Advanced Model Can Now Be Customized. Here's How (2 minute read)](https://www.inc.com/ben-sherry/openais-most-advanced-model-can-now-be-customized-heres-how.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini can now be fine-tuned and customized by developers for business use. Developers can now use their own datasets to enhance the model's knowledge base with proprietary information and control how the model responds to specific questions. It costs $25 for every 1 million tokens used to fine-tune GPT-4o - $3 for GPT-4o mini. 1 million tokens is roughly equivalent to 2,500 pages in a standard-size book.

The company has planned a follow-up mission that involves a larger spacecraft docking with the targeted metallic asteroid using magnets.

[### An underrated software engineering interview question (8 minute read)](https://blog.jez.io/bugsquash/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The bug squash interview involves asking candidates to find a bug and maybe write code to fix it. It is very effective because it reflects everyday software development, it's easy for the candidate to self-assess their own progress, it's difficult to cheat, and candidates who are good at it are good at it because they have practiced debugging day in and day out their entire career. The bug squash interview tests a skill rarely covered by existing interview loops. It's also fun to do.

[### Your TV set has become a digital billboard. And it's only getting worse (21 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/tv-industrys-ads-tracking-obsession-is-turning-your-living-room-into-a-store/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Rather than selling as many TVs as possible, TV manufacturers are increasingly seeking recurring revenue from already-sold TVs via ad sales and tracking. Some brands already prioritize data collection and the ability to sell ads and most are trying to boost their appeal to advertisers. Smart TV OS providers are generating revenue by licensing their software and through revenue sharing of in-app purchases and subscriptions. Budget TVs are the leaders in this trend as companies often offset cheap hardware prices with ads and data collection.

[### North America added a whole Silicon Valley's worth of data center inventory this year. It's not enough (2 minute read)](https://sherwood.news/tech/new-energy-power-supply-data-centers-demand/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The eight primary data center markets in North America added 515 megawatts (MW) of new supply in the first half of this year. All of Silicon Valley has 459 MW of data center supply. Data center space under construction is currently at a record high. The vast majority is already leased. The insane amounts of data center capacity being built are still not enough to meet the growing demands of cloud computing and artificial intelligence providers. This demand has raised national rental rates by 6.5% on average.
