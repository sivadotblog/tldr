[### Tesla Shareholders Approve Elon Musk's $1 Trillion Pay Package (5 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-vote-9abd5a73?st=d8Surv&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&mod=tldr&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Tesla shareholders have voted to approve a plan to motivate Elon Musk with a bonus of as much as $1 trillion in additional stock. Musk had threatened on social media to leave the company if the measure was rejected. He claimed he wanted a big enough ownership stake in Tesla so that he couldn't be fired, so the 'robot army' he is developing doesn't fall into the wrong hands. The new pay package includes 12 chunks of stock that could give Musk control of as much as 25% of Tesla if he hits a series of milestones in the next decade.

[### Google's Ironwood TPUs represent a bigger threat than Nvidia would have you believe (6 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/06/googles_ironwood_tpus_ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google's latest generation of Ironwood accelerators will become generally available in the coming weeks. The TPU v7 accelerators are a major leap in performance over prior generations. They offer performance close to Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, when normalizing floating point perf to the same precision. The TPUs can be scaled into truly enormous compute domains - Google is offering the chips in pods of 256 up to 9,216.

The UAE's Emirate Genome Programme started six years ago with the goal of mapping the genetic code of all of the nation's around one million citizens. The country believes that gene sequencing is both a public-health project and a key part of the country's multitrillion-dollar effort to refashion itself from a petrostate into an AI powerhouse. The project has already collected DNA samples from more than 750,000 Emirates. Efforts to pair AI with genomic data have yet to yield profitable drugs, but many believe they will soon.

[### AI Turns Brain Scans Into Full Sentences and It's Eerie To Say The Least (8 minute read)](https://www.zmescience.com/future/ai-turns-brain-scans-into-full-sentences-and-its-eerie-to-say-the-least/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

'Mind captioning' is a method developed at NTT Communication Science Laboratories in Japan that uses a blend of brain images and AI to generate text descriptions of what people are seeing (or even visualizing) based only on their neural patterns. In tests, the system was able to correctly describe scenes viewed by participants about half the time, even when presented with a hundred possibilities - and even when participants were just visualizing the scenes in their mind. The technology is still far from being a mind-reading device, but it could have serious ethical implications when it becomes more capable.

[### Dead framework theory (17 minute read)](https://aifoc.us/dead-framework-theory/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

As large language models become more dominant, new frameworks will find it hard to gain traction because the models won't have enough training data about them. The industry needs to innovate and build new frameworks, libraries, and platform features to push the web forward and create competition. Developers need to have clear strategies to get their work into the LLM training corpus, system prompts, and developer minds. If the industry continues its current focus on maintainability and developer experience, we'll end up in a world where the web is built by LLMs using only what is entrenched in the training data.

OpenAI's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, raised concerns after she mentioned the prospect of government aid for the company at a recent conference. Friar has since made a post clarifying her statement, saying that she was making the point that US strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity, which requires the private sector and government to play their parts. David Sacks, the White House's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said the federal government has no intention of providing any kind of bailout to AI companies.
