[### There is a ‚Äògravity hole‚Äô in the Indian Ocean, and scientists now think they know why (4 minute read)](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/24/world/gravity-hole-geoid-low-indian-ocean-scn/index.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There is a spot in the Indian Ocean where Earth's gravitational pull is weaker, its mass is lower than normal, and the sea level dips by over 328 feet. Researchers from India believe that the phenomenon is caused by plumes of magma coming from deep inside the planet. They came to that conclusion by studying how the Earth formed its shape starting from 140 million years ago. The Earth is not a perfect sphere, and its many plate movements can cause areas of different densities to form.

[### This ultra-small probe promises to record neuron activity without invasive surgery (8 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/mev-probe-records-neuron-activity?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from Stanford University have developed a microendovascular probe that can record deep brain activity without surgery. The brain-machine interface can be used to monitor and treat many neurological diseases minimally invasively. It has successfully been used to record single neuron activity in rats without causing any damage. The device could impact the treatment of many diseases, but it will take some time to translate safely to clinical studies.
