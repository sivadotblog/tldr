If you‚Äôre selling B2B software, one of the first questions you‚Äôll hear is ‚Äúhow does this integrate with our [CRM / ticketing / HR system]?‚Äù

So you start adding integrations. The first few are easy enough. But over time, they become a major time sink. Your feature delivery slows down. Devs get annoyed.

If you‚Äôre thinking: someone should automate this - you‚Äôre right‚Ä¶

And [Merge](https://merge.dev/sponsorships/tldr?utm_campaign=TLDR%20Q3%202023&utm_source=sponsorship&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_content=Primary) already has.

It‚Äôs simple: Instead of dealing with dozens of APIs, you build on Merge‚Äôs [unified API](https://merge.dev/sponsorships/tldr?utm_campaign=TLDR%20Q3%202023&utm_source=sponsorship&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_content=Primary) and [common data model](https://merge.dev/sponsorships/tldr?utm_campaign=TLDR%20Q3%202023&utm_source=sponsorship&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_content=Primary). Now you can add [hundreds of integrations](https://merge.dev/sponsorships/tldr?utm_campaign=TLDR%20Q3%202023&utm_source=sponsorship&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_content=Primary) with just a few lines of code.

Calendly, Drata, and Gong are already on board. [Start for free with a special offer for TLDR readers](https://merge.dev/sponsorships/tldr?utm_campaign=TLDR%20Q3%202023&utm_source=sponsorship&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_content=Primary)

[### Researchers sequence genomes of rare parrot to help it thrive (6 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/genomes-could-help-enigmatic-endangered-nocturnal-parrot-make-a-comeback/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç is a critically endangered species native to New Zealand. While its populations have risen slowly over the last decade, the limited genetic diversity in the species' population has made breeding problematic. Most kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç are severely inbred and susceptible to disease and infertility. Researchers are now sequencing the genomes of nearly all existing birds to discover genetic variants in the population to help preserve the species.

[### Death by a thousand microservices (15 minute read)](https://renegadeotter.com/2023/09/10/death-by-a-thousand-microservices.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

There is no need for every service to be 'micro'. Some startups do fine with just 'services'. Starting with a monolith is fine. Services can be branched from the monolith if they take care of a clearly-identifiable and separately-scalable load. A simple approach is often a more appropriate choice.

[### Charter-Disney Winners and Losers (12 minute read)](https://stratechery.com/2023/charter-disney-winners-and-losers/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Disney and Charter Communications have reached an agreement to restore popular channels to the cable operator, ending a blackout that lasted for more than a week. The agreement marks a seminal moment in the relationship between pay-TV providers and entertainment companies. Charter appears to be the winner in the standoff as Disney has been forced to give up its attempt at double-dipping by getting paid by Charter for channels and charging subscribers directly for the same content. However, Disney may end up being the long-term winner. More details about the agreement and its implications are available in the article.

[### The way that Jensen Huang runs Nvidia is wild (2 minute read)](https://twitter.com/danhockenmaier/status/1701608618087571787?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes that the flattest organization is the most empowering one, so there are no 1:1s in the company and everything happens in the group setting. There are no status reports within Nvidia - Huang believes that these are too refined by the time they get to him. Anyone in the company can email Huang with whatever is on top of their mind and he will read it. The company doesn't have any formal planning cycles, but strategy meetings are open to all employees. Nvidia is optimized for attracting amazing people and allowing information to travel as quickly as possible.
