[### New type of cherry tomato self-dries while still on the vine (2 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/science/self-drying-cherry-tomato/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Supree, a food tech company, has created tomatoes with microscopic cracks in their skin that allow moisture to naturally evaporate from within them, resulting in tomatoes that have lost 80% of their original weight by the time they're packed. The tomatoes can be dried further after harvest to tweak their content, but that process doesn't involve the use of any additives. The dried tomatoes can be reportedly kept for a year after being frozen for shipping and storage without any negative effect on their taste, texture, or nutritional value. Supree will sell its product directly to corporate clients for now.

Stanchion is an SQLite 3 extension that enables column-oriented storage in SQLite. It brings all of the benefits of column-oriented storage and data warehousing to anywhere SQLite is already deployed. Column-oriented storage outperforms row-oriented storage for storing and processing metric, log, and event data, time series data storage and analysis, change tracking, and anchor modeling. Stanchion uses compression techniques that significantly reduce the size of stored data, greatly reducing the cost of large data sets.
