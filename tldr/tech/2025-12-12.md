AI hacking tools are now surpassing some human hackers. Stanford's Artemis AI bot beat all except one of the 10 professional penetration testers in a test of its abilities. It found bugs at lightning speed while running at under $60 an hour. However, about 18% of the bugs it found were false positives. It also missed an obvious bug that most of the human testers spotted.

[### Compound Engineering: How Every Codes With Agents (13 minute read)](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/compound-engineering-how-every-codes-with-agents?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

In traditional engineering, each feature makes the next feature harder to build because of new edge cases, interdependencies, and issues. In compound engineering, each feature makes the next feature easier to build because compound engineering creates a learning loop for agents and team members so that each bug, failed test, or insight gets documented and used by future agents. AI's knowledge of the codebase grows along with it, making future development work faster. This post provides a high-level sense of how to start compound engineering with AI.

[### An SVG is all you need (4 minute read)](https://jon.recoil.org/blog/2025/12/an-svg-is-all-you-need.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

SVGs are vector graphics in a simple XML format. They are supported on almost every device and platform. With embeddable scripts to make them interactive, SVGs are way more capable than many people realize. It is entirely feasible to implement an entire data analysis pipeline in an SVG. A completely self-contained SVG file can fetch data from a versioned repository, process that data, and generate visualizations without any server-side magic required.

Several social media platforms are now required to shut down the accounts of teens under 16 in Australia under a new law intended to shelter children from the mental-health risks of life online. These companies are now required to take reasonable steps to enforce the new rules under threat of penalty. Parents and children won't be fined. Australia isn't alone in its effort - Malaysia, the EU, New Zealand, Florida, and other regions are also discussing similar restrictions.
