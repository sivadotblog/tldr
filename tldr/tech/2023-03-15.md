[### Amazon says its satellite home-Internet terminals cost under $400 to produce (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/amazon-says-its-satellite-home-internet-terminals-cost-under-400-to-produce/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon has revealed three types of satellite broadband user terminals set to roll out service in 2024. The standard model has been crafted for residential and small business customers and will cost Amazon just under $400 to manufacture. It is less than 11 inches square, weighs less than five pounds, and is less than an inch thick. The device is capable of delivering speeds up to 400 Mbps. There will be a smaller 'ultra-compact' option, providing speeds of up to 100Mbps, and a larger 19x30-inch version that will enable users to access 1Gbps speeds. Pricing plans for the devices and services have yet to be announced.

[### Mini Robot Enters Blood Vessels, Completes Surgery (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/mini-robot-surgeon?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers in South Korea have developed an untethered, magnetically guided robot that can navigate blood vessels autonomously to reach blockages and lesions with greater accuracy than human surgeons guided by X-rays. The process involves the creation of a 3D map of the patient‚Äôs blood vessels, which is used to guide the robot in treatments. The robot is only millimeters in size and has so far demonstrated its effectiveness in pigs. The research paves the way for robots to perform medical procedures with greater ease, precision, and safety compared to human surgeons.

[### Mark Zuckerberg says engineers who joined Meta in-person perform better than those who joined remotely (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-engineers-who-joined-meta-in-person-perform-better-than-those-who-joined-remotely/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Mark Zuckerberg recently presented in a staff memo an internal data analysis indicating that engineers who began working in an in-person setting performed better than those who began remotely. Engineers who began in-person and later transitioned to remote work and those who remained entirely in-person performed better than those who started remotely. Younger engineers were found to perform better when working in-person for at least three days each week. Meta says it intends to continue embracing remote work, but the study suggests that it also wants to encourage more in-person work.
