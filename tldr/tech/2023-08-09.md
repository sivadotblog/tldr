It was once valued by SoftBank at $40 billion.

[### Nvidia reveals new A.I. chip, says costs of running LLMs will ‚Äòdrop significantly‚Äô (2 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/08/nvidia-reveals-new-ai-chip-says-cost-of-running-large-language-models-will-drop-significantly-.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia has announced the GH200, a new chip designed to run AI models. It has the same GPU as the H100, but it pairs that GPU with 141 gigabytes of memory and a 72-core ARM central processor. The extra memory will allow larger AI models to fit on a single system and cut the cost of inference significantly. The GH200 will be available for sampling by the end of this year and for purchase in the second quarter of next year. Nvidia representatives have declined to specify a price for the chip.

[### Hopes Dashed As LK-99 Confirmed Not To Be A Room-Temperature Superconductor (3 minute read)](https://www.iflscience.com/hopes-dashed-as-lk-99-confirmed-not-to-be-a-room-temperature-superconductor-70165?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The extraordinary claim that LK-99 is a room-temperature superconductor has been debunked. There is evidence that the material actually increases in resistance as temperatures lower. The diamagnetism seen in several videos isn't very interesting in itself as there are many diamagnetic materials without revolutionary applications. While LK-99 may not be a revolutionary superconductor, there are other new materials with revolutionary properties expected to come out in the next decade.

[### Insights into Stack Overflow‚Äôs traffic (3 minute read)](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/08/08/insights-into-stack-overflows-traffic/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The graphs circulating around social media regarding Stack Overflow's traffic are inaccurate. Stack Overflow made a couple of changes over the last year that impacted how it measured and reported traffic. The graphs seen by social media are based on deprecated data. Stack Overflow has seen a small decline in traffic (an average of ~5% less traffic compared to 2022), but nothing like what those graphs show (a 35%-50% decrease).
