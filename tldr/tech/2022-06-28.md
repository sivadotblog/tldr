[### Dangerous viruses 'hitchhike' on microplastics to survive in freshwater (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/viruses-hitchhike-on-microplastics-freshwater?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team of researchers proved that viruses can survive and remain contagious by attaching themselves to plastics in water. Microplastics are everywhere, including in our food, drinking water, and air.

[### Octopus and human brains share the same ‚Äújumping genes‚Äù (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/octopus-human-brains-jumping-genes?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_content=27062022?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers in Italy studying octopus brains found that octopus brains have active transposons, also known as jumping genes. Transposons help the DNA inside the nucleus of cells cut or copy and paste into different regions of the genome. Some of the transposons are similar to transposons that are active in the human brain. The similarities between the human brain and the octopus brain can be explained by convergent evolution.
