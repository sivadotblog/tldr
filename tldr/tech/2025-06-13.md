[### AMD reveals next-generation AI chips with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (8 minute read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/amd-mi400-ai-chips-openai-sam-altman.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has unveiled new details about its next-generation AI chips. The Instinct MI400 series will ship next year. They can be assembled into full server racks with thousands of chips. AMD's rack-scale setup will make the chips look to users like one system, which is important for most customers who develop large language models.

[### Shopify partners with Coinbase and Stripe in landmark stablecoin deal (2 minute read)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shopify-partners-coinbase-stripe-landmark-182707374.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Shopify is rolling out stablecoin payments to all users on its platform later this year.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Experimental retina implants give mice infrared vision (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/experimental-retina-implants-give-mice-infrared-vision/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Chinese scientists recently built prototype retinal implants that can replace failing photoreceptors and potentially provide infrared vision as a bonus. They work without an external camera or power source. The implants have been tested in mice and non-human primates - results in mice seemed promising, with the blind mice in the study responding to light and seemingly being able to see near-infrared wavelengths as well. The implants let the primates see infrared light, but their normal vision appeared unchanged.

[### Bioengineered tooth "grows" in place to look and feel like the real thing (4 minute read)](https://newatlas.com/medical-devices/tooth-implant-innovation/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have developed an artificial tooth implant that 'grows' into the gums and fuses with existing nerves to mimic the form and function of a real tooth. They can be put in place without any bone drilling. The artificial tooth features a biodegradable outer layer that contains stem cells and specific proteins that trigger the cells to mature into nerve tissue. This allows the implant to 'talk' to the brain, much like a real tooth, allowing the tooth to sense things like food texture and temperature.

[### Agentic Coding Recommendations (15 minute read)](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/12/agentic-coding/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Agentic coding is evolving rapidly. This post describes an agentic workflow - while it might be quickly outdated, it shows how integrating agents in the development processes can unlock significant productivity gains. While tools and techniques will evolve, the core principles remain essential. The goal isn't just to leverage agents to write code faster, but to write better, more maintainable, and resilient code.

[### Suppressions of Suppressions (4 minute read)](https://overreacted.io/suppressions-of-suppressions/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Developers will sometimes need to suppress rules in build processes because those rules are wrong or unnecessarily strict. However, as people get used to suppressing rules, they might run into another problem - some rules are really bad to suppress as suppressing them might cause unforeseen issues. One way to deal with suppressions is to introduce a lint rule that forbids developers from suppressing some other lint rules.

[### Waymo rides cost more than Uber or Lyft ‚Äî and people are paying anyway (5 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/waymo-rides-cost-more-than-uber-or-lyft-and-people-are-paying-anyway/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Waymo's self-driving car rides are consistently more expensive compared to offerings from Uber and Lyft. The company's average price at peak hours is about $11 more expensive than Lyft and nearly $9.50 pricier than Uber. The price difference shows excitement for the technology and a real preference to sometimes be in a car without a driver. Shorter trips tend to cost more than longer ones - the pricing gap shrinks as rides get longer.
