[### Chinese scientists say maglev ‚Äòsky train‚Äô floats without power using permanent magnets (3 minute read)](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3188370/chinese-scientists-say-maglev-sky-train-floats-without-power?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

China has launched an 800-meter experimental maglev line with permanent magnets that can keep a maglev train afloat forever without a power supply. It uses powerful magnets rich in rare earth elements. The magnets can lift a train with 88 passengers in the air. The new technology generates little electromagnetic radiation and costs about a tenth of what it costs to build a subway. China controls more than 80% of the world's permanent magnet producing capacity.

[### Breakthrough in nuclear fusion energy: Ignition confirmed in record 1.3 megajoule shot (3 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/breakthrough-nuclear-fusion-energy-ignition-record-megajoule-shot?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A nuclear yield of more than 1.3 megajoules was achieved in August 2021. The results of the experiment were published in three peer-reviewed papers exactly one year later. The experiment establishes that fusion ignition in the lab is possible. The researchers have not been able to recreate the same level of fusion yield since.
