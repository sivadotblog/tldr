[### How Cursor Stops Fake Accounts from Abusing Free Trials (Sponsor)](https://workos.com/blog/what-is-free-trial-abuse?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=q32025)

Free trials help AI apps grow, but they also attract abuse. Fake accounts steal tokens, drain compute, and disrupt real users.

Cursor, the fast-growing AI code assistant, uses [WorkOS Radar](https://workos.com/radar?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q32025) to detect and stop abuse in real time. Radar runs silently in the background, using device fingerprinting and behavioral signals to block fraud before it reaches your app.

[### Apple Plans AI-Powered Web Search Tool for Siri to Rival OpenAI, Perplexity (10 minute read)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-03/apple-plans-ai-search-engine-for-siri-to-rival-openai-google-siri-talks-advance?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1Njk2MjI4MCwiZXhwIjoxNzU3NTY3MDgwLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMU1KOE9HUDlWRDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2NTc1NjkyN0UwMkM0N0MwQkQ0MDNEQTJGMEUyNzIyMyJ9.Fc0MRyCTQoVpee11NJjcjCohQx7MAsN2DFQ4GnKhDTc&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Apple is planning to launch its own AI-powered search tool next year. It is working on a new system that will be integrated into the Siri voice assistant. The underlying technology could come from Google - the companies recently reached a formal agreement for Apple to evaluate and test a Google-developed AI model. The company may eventually add the technology to its Safari web browser and Spotlight.

[### In a first, scientists map complete brain activity during decision-making (4 minute read)](https://interestingengineering.com/science/first-mouse-brain-decision-map?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have mapped decision-making at a single-cell resolution across an entire mouse brain. The effort by the International Brain Laboratory, a global consortium of 22 labs, was coordinated by three Princeton labs. The experimental setup involved making mice move tiny steering wheels to control shapes on a screen while recording neural activity using high-density electrodes. The work showed that decision-making is very broadly distributed throughout the brain, including in regions previously thought not to be involved. The coordination of 22 labs worldwide demonstrates the power of large-scale neuroscience.

Amazon's Project Kuiper team has posted a video showing the satellite internet service delivering a 1,280 Mbps download rate. The constellation currently has over 100 satellites in orbit, with more set to launch in the coming weeks and months. The speed record was achieved using Kuiper's upcoming enterprise-grade customer terminal - the standard Kuiper dish promises max download speeds of 400 Mbps. Starlink is also preparing to offer gigabit speeds. It recently introduced a new upgraded dish for enterprises.

[### Seeing like a software company (21 minute read)](https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Thinking in terms of legibility and illegibility explains many of the things that are confusing about large software companies. It explains why companies do many things that seem obviously counter-productive, why the rules in practice are so often out of sync with the rules as written, and why companies are surprisingly willing to tolerate rule-breaking in some contexts. Increasing legibility often lowers efficiency, but its benefits are high enough that organizations are typically willing to do so regardless. Both the legible and illegible are important - the legible allows organizations to do things that would otherwise be impossible, while the illegible allows for high-efficiency work.

[### On evaluating agents (3 minute read)](https://aunhumano.com/index.php/2025/09/03/on-evaluating-agents/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

No amount of evals will replace the need to look at the data. It's really difficult and time-intensive to evaluate agents' outputs when you are trying to validate complex conversation patterns. Stop relying solely on manual testing and create evals for agents. Tools help simplify things, but you still have to look at the data and build evaluations for your use case. Don't rely solely on standard evals - build your own.

[### AI will change how we build startups -- but how? (12 minute read)](https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/ai-will-change-how-we-build-startups?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Most people's phone home screens probably currently don't have a lot of AI-native apps, particularly beyond the obvious LLM apps. This demonstrates an enormous opportunity, as it shows how people haven't really started changing the way they work using AI. AI will change the way we build startups, but it's not yet clear how that will happen. This article looks at historical precedents and other factors to try to predict how AI will change things. The best-case scenario is a world where AI enables fewer people to produce more.

[### Google FastSearch Is Faster Than Google Search (2 minute read)](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-fastsearch-40044.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google FastSearch is a technology used by Gemini for grounding purposes. It is faster than Google Search but retrieves fewer results, which can result in lower quality results, but it's good enough for grounding. FastSearch is not directly available to third parties. It is integrated into Vertex AI, which is available to third parties - Vertex customers do not receive FastSearch-ranked web results, only the information from those results.
