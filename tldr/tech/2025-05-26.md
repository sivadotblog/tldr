Authentication isn't just login. It's building secure flows, managing sessions, handling tokens, supporting SSO, and protecting user data. [AuthKit](https://www.authkit.com?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q22025) provides a fully hosted, customizable UI for sign-up, password resets, MFA, and seamless SSO ‚Äî production-ready from day one.

But authentication alone doesn't stop abuse. [WorkOS Radar](https://workos.com/radar?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=q22025) adds real-time threat prevention, detecting brute force, credential stuffing, and more. Built-in protections can be enabled instantly ‚Äî no scripts or custom logic required.

[### Nvidia Pushes Further Into Cloud With GPU Marketplace (2 minute read)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nvidia-pushes-further-into-cloud-with-gpu-marketplace-4fba6bdd?st=DfFD41&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Nvidia's DGX Cloud Lepton is a new service designed to link artificial intelligence developers with Nvidia's network of cloud providers, including CoreWeave, Lambda, and Crusoe. It provides access to Nvidia's graphics processing units, making those chips more widely accessible to all developers. The platform will have a marketplace of GPU cloud vendors that developers can pick from to train and use their AI models. Developers can choose which cloud provider to work with and even work with multiple cloud providers.

[### The Man Who ‚ÄòA.G.I.-Pilled' Google (56 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/podcasts/google-ai-demis-hassabis-hard-fork.html?unlocked_article_code=1.J08.ZoUC.Cl0bKjzrfrHk&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Demis Hassabis, the chief executive of Google DeepMind, has been dreaming of artificial general intelligence (AGI) for years. He was already taking the possibility of AGI seriously when Google acquired DeepMind in 2014. Today, he is among a growing number of tech leaders racing to build AGI. Hassabis and a colleague received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry last year for their work on AlphaFold, an AI system capable of predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins. This article contains a transcript of an interview with Hassabis about his views on AGI and the future that follows its arrival.

### Science & Futuristic Technology

[### Robots Are Starting to Make Decisions in the Operating Room (11 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/star-autonomous-surgical-robot?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Autonomous robots aren't being used to operate on people yet, but the technology is almost capable of such a feat and more autonomy is on the way. The technology could help hospitals meet the high demand for safety and consistency during surgeries, manage routine tasks, and prevent mistakes. Future robots will use AI to autonomously manage movements and decision-making during surgical tasks, reducing the need for constant human input. With the number of surgeons around the world declining while the number of people who need surgery continues to increase, the need for the technology is clear.

[### Valve CEO Gabe Newell's Neuralink competitor is expecting its first brain chip this year (3 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/news/673938/gabe-newell-valve-founder-brain-computer-interface-first-chip-starfish?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Starfish Neuroscience, a brain-computer interface startup incorporated by Valve co-founder and CEO Gabe Newell, plans to produce its very first brain chip later this year. The company is currently seeking collaborators to open up avenues for the technology. Starfish's goal is to create a smaller and less invasive implant than the competition that can enable simultaneous access to multiple brain regions. Details from the chip's current spec sheet are available in the article. The article also links to a video of a talk from Valve that explains how the technology could enhance gaming.

Bohan Zhang, a member of OpenAI's Infrastructure team, recently shared the company's best practices with PostgreSQL at the PGConf.dev 2025 Global Developer Conference. The talk offers a glimpse into the database usage of one of the most prominent unicorn companies and demonstrates how PostgreSQL can scale gracefully under massive read loads. OpenAI utilizes managed databases on Azure, employing a classic PostgreSQL primary-replication architecture without sharding. This article covers the content of Zhang's talk along with comments and includes some more details about OpenAI's infrastructure.

[### At Amazon, Some Coders Say Their Jobs Have Begun to Resemble Warehouse Work (12 minute read)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/business/amazon-ai-coders.html?unlocked_article_code=1.J08._qIT.WOlnPasPfdcj&smid=url-share&utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

As AI spreads through the labor force, many white-collar workers say their work is becoming more routine, less thoughtful, and much faster-paced. Companies seem to be persuaded that AI can increase productivity. Teams are getting smaller, but they're being expected to output the same amount of work by using AI. Managers say that AI can relieve employees of tedious tasks and enable them to perform more interesting work, but for inexperienced workers, the change resembles the shift from artisanal work to factory work in the 19th and 20th centuries.

[### Ask HN: Go deep into AI/LLMs or just use them as tools? (Hacker News Thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44079303&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Large language models are becoming commodities. Many people use them, but few people are developing them from scratch. Developing large language models involves a lot of hardcore computer science and math - people can use them without having to know any of the internals. While it might be helpful to understand some of the internals and math, it's probably best to stick to learning how to get good at using these models and integrating what they do into agentic systems.
