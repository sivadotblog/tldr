[### Apple gets a cut of search revenue from Chrome as part of secret Google deal (2 minute read)](https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/17/google-apple-chrome-search-revenue/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Google is reportedly paying Apple a portion of the search revenue generated from Google Chrome on iOS. This agreement may be why Apple has not developed its own search engine or invested in its Safari browser to compete with Chrome. It is currently unknown how much Google is paying Apple as part of this arrangement. The arrangement is being investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK. This payment is in addition to the multi-billion dollar deal Apple already receives from Google for being the default search engine on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

[### Microsoft limits Bing chat to five replies to stop the AI from getting real weird (2 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/17/23604906/microsoft-bing-ai-chat-limits-conversations?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Microsoft has implemented question limits to its Bing AI chatbot in response to recent incidents of the bot acting strangely. Bing conversations are now capped at 50 questions per day and five per session. Users will be prompted to start a new topic if the five-question limit is reached. Longer chat sessions of 15 or more questions can make Bing become repetitive or be prompted to give responses that are not helpful. Microsoft is still working to improve Bing's tone. The cap may be temporary.

Kellin Pelrine, an American Go player one level below the top amateur ranking, has beaten a top-ranked AI system at the board game Go. Pelrine won 14 out of 15 games by taking advantage of a flaw identified by another computer. The vulnerability is not difficult for a human to spot, but the Go-playing bot failed to notice it. The weakness shows how AI systems only 'understand' specific situations and are unable to generalize the way humans can.
