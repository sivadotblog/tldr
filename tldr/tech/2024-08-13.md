Scientists at Northwestern University have invented a goo that could open the door to regenerating human knee cartilage. The goo mimics the chemical structure of cartilage. Animal subjects who had their joints treated with the biomaterial grew new cartilage within six months. If the goo works in humans, it could benefit people who need knee replacement surgeries, athletes who experience ACL tears, and people who suffer from degenerative diseases like arthritis.

[### GIL Become Optional in Python 3.13 (4 minute read)](https://geekpython.in/gil-become-optional-in-python?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can be disabled in Python version 3.13. GIL is a mechanism used by the C Python interpreter to ensure that only one thread executes the Python bytecode at a time. Free-threaded mode, which disables GIL, is currently experimental. Disabling GIL makes a massive difference in the performance of multithreaded tasks.

[### Go is my hammer, and everything is a nail (5 minute read)](https://www.maragu.dev/blog/go-is-my-hammer-and-everything-is-a-nail?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Go can do basically anything. It's simple, easy to read, and consistent. Using only Go means less context switching and leads to a deeper understanding of the language. There are basically an infinite number of projects out there, so there's still plenty to build even if only knowing one language was a restriction.
