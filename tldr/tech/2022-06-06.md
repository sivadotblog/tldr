[### Researchers Just Set a New Record For Data Transmission Speed (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-just-set-a-new-record-for-data-transmission-speed?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A team at the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology in Japan has set a new record for data transmission by sending 1.02 petabits per second over 51.7 kilometers. A 0.125 mm diameter multi-core fiber with wavelength division multiplexing that sent a total of 801 parallel wavelength channels was used for the experiment. Various other optimizations, such as using four cores, signal boosting, and decoding technologies were also used. The feat was achieved using an optical fiber network similar to those used currently for internet infrastructure, making future upgrades to this technology easier.

Scientists from the University of California, Irvine have created human cells with tunable transparency. They genetically engineered human embryonic kidney cells to express reflectin, a protein that allows squids to scatter light and become invisible. The reflectin in the modified cells behaved almost as they did in their native cephalopod cells. The transparency of the cells could be controlled by altering the sodium levels of their environment.
