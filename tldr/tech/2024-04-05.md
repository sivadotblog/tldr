[### Physicists take a major step toward making a nuclear clock (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-clock-thorium-physics?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Scientists were recently able to use a tabletop laser to bump an atomic nucleus into a higher energy state, a feat that paves the path towards creating the first nuclear clock. Nuclear clocks keep time based on the inner workings of atomic nuclei. They could be more simple and portable than atomic clocks. They could also be used to test fundamental physics theories in new ways. Nuclear clocks are based on different physics than atomic clocks, so comparing the two types of timepieces could allow for new studies of fundamental physics.

[### Signals for Tailwind CSS (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/brandonmcconnell/tailwindcss-signals?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Signals for Tailwind CSS is a plugin that utilizes style queries via container queries to reactively enable custom states that can be consumed by descendants in the DOM. It reduces development effort and the need to compose a chain of variants. Signals for Tailwind CSS is useful for simplifying the application of styles based on ancestor states, improving developer experience with a more declarative API, and reducing the need for complex selector chaining and arbitrary targeting. Browser support for style queries is still limited, so Signals for Tailwind CSS may not be suitable for projects that require broad compatibility.

[### Anatomy of a credit card rewards program (26 minute read)](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/anatomy-of-credit-card-rewards-programs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Credit cards earn money in multiple different ways. One important method is interchange, a fee paid by card-accepting businesses. The fee is split between various parties in the credit card ecosystem for marketing. Credit card issuers offer rewards cards so customers use their rails and then compete with each other for 'share of wallet' by bidding with interchange. Not every card is a reward card due to different card applications and features, regulations, collusion, and other reasons. This article explains how credit card rewards programs work and the systems that work together that make them profitable.
