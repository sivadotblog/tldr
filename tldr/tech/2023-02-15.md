[### Researchers identify compounds that could lead to an on-demand, short-term contraceptive for men (2 minute read)](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/979321??utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers have identified a potential non-hormonal contraceptive for men. The compound temporarily disables an enzyme essential for activating a sperm cell's ability to swim and mature. It can be taken shortly before sexual activity with fertility restored the next day. The compound was shown to be effective in mice and did not interfere with the animals' sexual functioning.

[### Scientists Use "Acoustic Holograms" To Form Particles Into Complex 3D Shapes (2 minute read)](https://futurism.com/the-byte/acoustic-holograms-form-3d-shapes?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers in Germany have created 3D shapes out of particles suspended in water using ultrasonic waves. The acoustic holograms are produced by manipulating the pressure exerted by high frequency ultrasonic waves through an inexpensive 3D-printed plate. The researchers were able to form a helix and a figure 8 out of silica gel beads and create spherical clumps of biological cells. The technique could have invaluable applications for gently manipulating delicate biological cells.
