[### Bitcoin hits $100,000 (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/bitcoin-hits-100000/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Bitcoin hit $100,000 on Wednesday. The cryptocurrency has been experiencing a massive upswing since Donald Trump, who is a crypto supporter, won the 2024 presidential election. Trump recently announced his intentions to nominate Paul Atkins, a crypto advocate, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission after Gary Gensler, a noted crypto critic, resigns on Inauguration Day. Trump has vowed to create a national stockpile of bitcoins to help wipe out US national debt. Atkins has said before that the US' tough stance on cryptocurrency has driven investors to other markets where regulations are clearer. Shifting US regulations to be more accommodating could bring those investments back to the US.

[### Protecting Undersea Internet Cables Is a Tech Nightmare (4 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/undersea-internet-cables-protection-tech?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

A lot of the global communications and financial system hinges on a few hundred cables of bundled glass fibers strung across ocean floors around the world, each about the same diameter as a garden hose. Defending these undersea fiber-optic cables from damage and sabotage is increasingly challenging. While there are plans to create future internet backup routes through satellites, the technology is still only in a preliminary proof-of-concept stage and may be many years away from being deployed. It is currently not possible to monitor all 1.5 million kilometers of communication cables in the water, but new technologies are emerging that will make it easier to monitor activity where damage is most likely to occur and potentially prevent disruptions.
