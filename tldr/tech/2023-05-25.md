[### Brain waves can tell us how much pain someone is in (2 minute read)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/22/1073465/brain-waves-can-tell-us-how-much-pain-someone-is-in/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from the University of California have developed a technique for recording chronic pain-related brain signals. The technique could aid in the creation of personalized therapies for patients. It involves using a machine learning model that analyzes brain activity from electrodes implanted in patients with chronic pain. The model was able to predict how patients would score the severity of their pain. The next step in the research is to try to track the same signals in a non-invasive way.

[### Brain And Spine Implants Restore Movement in a Man Paralyzed by an Accident (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-and-spine-implants-restore-movement-in-a-man-paralyzed-by-an-accident?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne have helped a man who had been paralyzed for over a decade to walk again. The man had previously been able to walk with the help of a front-wheel walker, but he had reached a neurological recovery plateau. The treatment involved implanting two devices into the patient, one above the brain and one to the part of the spinal cord responsible for triggering motion in his legs. The devices allow the brain's signals to bypass the injured section of the patient's cervical spinal cord, enabling the patient to walk, stand, climb stairs, get across varying terrains, and stand at the bar to enjoy a beer with his friends.
