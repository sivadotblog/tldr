[### Netflix gets the NFL: Three-year deal starts this season on Christmas (1 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/netflix-gets-the-nfl-three-year-deal-starts-this-season-on-christmas/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

Amazon and Netflix have signed a three-year deal that will put exclusive Christmas games on the streaming service. The first two games will be aired on Christmas Day. 2025 and 2026 will see at least one game on the service each Christmas.

[### Here's the inside story of why Elon Musk fired the entire Tesla Supercharger staff (8 minute read)](https://www.autoblog.com/2024/05/15/heres-the-inside-story-of-why-elon-musk-fired-the-entire-tesla-supercharger-staff/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

This article presents the story of Tesla's Supercharger firings based on interviews with eight former charging-division employees, one contractor, and an email that Tesla sent to outside vendors. Charging chief Rebecca Tinucci went to meet with Elon Musk about the network's future the day before the firings. Tinucci had recently cut between 15% to 20% of staff, but Musk wanted more layoffs. She balked at the request, saying that deeper cuts would undermine the charging businesses' fundamentals. Musk responded by firing Tinucci and her entire 500-member team.

The world's need for computing requires colossal amounts of power that will soon exceed what the planet can provide. Superconductors offer the possibility of drastically lower energy consumption as they do not dissipate energy when passing a current. While they require cryogenic temperatures to work, they offer many benefits like zero-resistance interconnects, digital logic built on ultrashort pulses that require minimal energy, and the capacity for incredible computing density due to easy 3D chip stacking. Superconducting computers can be more power efficient than their classical cousins at large scales.
