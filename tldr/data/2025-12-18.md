### Deep Dives

[### How We Unlocked Performance at Scale with Jira Platform (15 minute read)](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/atlassian-engineering/how-we-unlocked-performance-at-scale-with-jira-platform?utm_source=tldrdata)

Jira Cloud's rearchitecture shifted from a single-tenant, monolithic model to a cloud-native, multi-tenant platform built for extreme scale, with targeted support for up to 1 billion issues per tenant and 99.999% uptime. Core services leverage document stores, sharding, multi-level caching, and resilient ingestion pipelines to achieve sub-15ms reads, reduced tail latency, and efficient permission enforcement. The redesign enables robust, permission-aware JQL search, rapid data replication, and consistent user experience across millions of tenants and projects.

[### Parallelizing ClickHouse Aggregation Merge for Fixed Hash Map (7 minute read)](https://clickhouse.com/blog/parallelizing-fixed-hashmap-aggregation-merge-in-clickhouse?utm_source=tldrdata)

ClickHouse 25.11 introduces parallel merge for small GROUP BY operations, harnessing multithreading to accelerate aggregations on 8-bit and 16-bit keys by partitioning FixedHashMap-based merge phases among threads. Performance gains are significant for complex aggregations, but overhead limits benefits for trivial operations, so the optimization is disabled in those cases. This enhancement directly boosts query efficiency for data processing workflows involving high-cardinality small-key groupings.

[### How Temporal Powers Reliable Cloud Operations at Netflix (7 minute read)](https://netflixtechblog.com/how-temporal-powers-reliable-cloud-operations-at-netflix-73c69ccb5953?utm_source=tldrdata)

Netflix moved Spinnaker Cloud Operations to Temporal, a durable execution platform, replacing Clouddriver's instance-local orchestration, retries, and homegrown rollback mechanism. Transient cloud-operation deployment failures fell from 4% to 0.0001% (~4.5 orders of magnitude) after a “Fast Properties” rollout that onboarded all apps within two quarters. Temporal made Clouddriver stateless, enforced idempotent API-call Activities with a 2-hour retry window, and improved debugging via workflow history/UI. Adoption now spans hundreds of control-plane use cases, doubling over the last year.

[### Building an Answering Machine (14 minute read)](https://motherduck.com/blog/analytics-agents/?utm_source=tldrdata)

MotherDuck's new Answering Machine lets anyone ask plain-English questions about real, messy data from ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini and get reliable answers without SQL. It works by using an agentic approach that explores tables, runs queries, checks results, and iterates like a human analyst, rather than guessing a single query. The result is practical self-service analytics that even non-technical users can trust on real business data.

### Opinions & Advice

[### Emerging Trends in AI Ethics and Governance for 2026 (5 minute read)](https://www.kdnuggets.com/emerging-trends-in-ai-ethics-and-governance-for-2026?utm_source=tldrdata)

Adaptive AI governance frameworks are now essential, integrating continuous oversight, dynamic policy versioning, and automated monitoring directly within deployment pipelines to address fast-evolving systems and live environment behaviors. Privacy engineering is a core design constraint, driving widespread adoption of differential privacy, secure enclaves, and synthetic data. Routine AI supply chain audits, real-time regulatory sandboxes, and advanced transparency stacks ensure traceability, multi-agent accountability, and stakeholder-aligned disclosures.

[### Apache Iceberg V3: Is It Ready? (6 minute read)](https://www.ryft.io/blog/apache-iceberg-v3-is-it-ready?utm_source=tldrdata)

Apache Iceberg V3 delivers major improvements like deletion vectors, row lineage, better semi-structured data, and encryption foundations. In practice, it is production-ready mainly if you run on Spark or Flink, with partial support elsewhere and notable gaps in engines like Athena, Trino, and Snowflake. V3 is clearly the future, but for most teams, it is still a wait and watch adoption rather than a safe default today.

[### Data Modeling for Private Markets: A Field Guide (10 minute read)](https://medium.com/arcesium-engineering-blog/data-modeling-for-private-markets-a-field-guide-1ef1c7642abe?utm_source=tldrdata)

Private-markets data tends to be low volume but poorly standardized, adequate data models win on schema resilience, not throughput: expect ID churn, bespoke joins, and schema drift. Use “stable references” in master tables (canonical self-links) to merge duplicates without rewriting downstream foreign keys. Model hierarchies with extension tables and keep base entities ~10–20 columns (worry at 25). Keep BI usable by targeting ~80% one-hop joins and standardizing a transactional+reference domain model via relation tags and an alias/view layer.

[### Data Project Hunt (Website)](https://www.dataprojecthunt.com/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Data Project Hunt is a community site for discovering and showcasing data engineering projects, built around weekly “launches,” voting, and maker recognition. It lets you submit projects, browse curated listings, filter by stack, follow recent activity, and see leaderboards for both projects and makers. A place to learn from real-world best practices and share your innovations.

[### sqlite-dist (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-dist/tree/main?utm_source=tldrdata)

sqlite-dist is a CLI tool that builds/packs precompiled SQLite extensions so you can ship them as a simple installable artifact. It targets multiple distribution channels (GitHub Releases, PyPI, npm, RubyGems, plus plugin ecosystems like Datasette, sqlite-utils, and sqlpkg), so the same extension can be consumed by different developer stacks. The project is explicitly marked work-in-progress, so expect rough edges, shifting commands, and documentation that's still being filled in.

[### LLM Optimization Made Simple: A Beginner's Guide to Ax (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ax-llm/ax/blob/main/docs/OPTIMIZE.md#-5-minute-quick-start?utm_source=tldrdata)

Meta's Ax framework streamlines optimization of LLM “programs” for tasks like classification via automatic instruction + few-shot demo tuning. With as few as 3 to 5 labeled examples and a metric, optimization typically runs ~1-2 minutes and can move accuracy from 70% to 90% while cutting costs by ~80%. The optimized result is saved as an AxOptimizedProgram for reproducible production rollout. A teacher-student workflow claims 50x lower token cost.

### Miscellaneous

[### Inference Economics 101: Reserved Compute Versus Inference APIs (12 minute read)](https://www.datagravity.dev/p/inference-economics-101-reserved?utm_source=tldrdata)

AI inference infrastructure is diverging into two dominant models: reserved/hourly compute platforms prioritizing predictability and control, and inference APIs that offer abstraction, high utilization (60–85%), and elastic scaling through customer aggregation. Reserved compute excels for deterministic, compliance-driven workloads with high individual GPU utilization, while inference APIs unlock superior cost efficiency by leveraging statistical multiplexing, even when individual customer utilization is low (10–30%). Sustainable platform economics hinge more on utilization than raw performance. Aggregation and abstraction beats peak tokens/sec as drivers of cost competitiveness and scalability.

[### In 2026, AI Infrastructure Will Face a Reckoning (4 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/in-2026-ai-infrastructure-will-face-a-reckoning/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Enterprises must overhaul data infrastructure by 2026 as AI agents strain every layer of the data stack, rendering legacy systems inadequate. Key shifts include adopting Model Context Protocol for seamless integration, implementing near-real-time CDC pipelines for scalable data access, strengthening end-to-end governance (especially multi-system lineage), and maintaining vendor independence via decoupled data planes. Accelerated adoption of durable execution platforms will also become essential for reliable agent-driven operations.
