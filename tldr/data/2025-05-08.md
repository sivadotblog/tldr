[### Transforming Data Analytics at Flipkart: Self Serve Insights on Petabytes scale data (9 minute read)](https://blog.flipkart.tech/transforming-data-analytics-at-flipkart-self-serve-insights-on-petabytes-scale-data-fa59caf2bc54?utm_source=tldrdata)

Flipkart's Data Platform enables self-serve analytics on petabyte-scale data, processing tens of petabytes each day using optimized compute for real-time mini-batch, and batch insights. Leveraging GenAI for natural language querying, the Self-Serve Insights Platform empowers non-technical users to generate reports and dashboards via intuitive interfaces, leveraging Apache Spark and Hive for complex query execution, and optimal storage with Apache Pulsar/Pubsub and Iceberg.

[### Building Fault-Tolerant Backends with Message Brokers: My Go-To Architecture (13 minute read)](https://medium.com/@a.e.ageev2001/building-fault-tolerant-backends-with-message-brokers-my-go-to-architecture-f559c3ed2112?utm_source=tldrdata)

A fault-tolerant backend architecture leverages message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ to handle retries, backpressure, and eventual consistency, separating valid and invalid messages to maintain system resilience under load. Using Kotlin and Spring Boot, the design implements a custom retry pattern with vector clocks or Lamport timestamps for causal consistency, ensuring ordered reprocessing. The system detects failure resolution when retry queues are empty, validated through a prototype simulating real-world asynchronous processing.

[### How Meta Understands Data at Scale (10 minute read)](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/04/28/security/how-meta-understands-data-at-scale/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Meta's Privacy Aware Infrastructure tackles the complexity of comprehending structure, meaning, and context across hundreds of disparate systems and over 100 million data assets by ‚Äúshifting-left‚Äù and embedding schematization and annotation early in the development processes. It introduces DataSchema, a Thrift-based canonical schema format that captures logical structures for tables, logs, streams, and AI models uniformly across all languages and systems. A multi-signal classification pipeline‚Äîcombining deterministic heuristics, ML classifiers on sampled data, and high-confidence lineage propagation‚Äîautomatically predicts and propagates semantic labels managed as a universal privacy taxonomy. All assets are inventoried in OneCatalog and continuously monitored via precision/recall metrics and developer feedback, enforcing purpose-limitation controls end-to-end and driving a cultural shift toward reusable, privacy-first practices.

[### Building Dash: How RAG and AI Agents Help Us Meet the Needs of Businesses (8 minute read)](https://dropbox.tech/machine-learning/building-dash-rag-multi-step-ai-agents-business-users?utm_source=tldrdata)

Dropbox Dash tackles fragmented, multimodal business data by marrying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with AI agents to deliver secure, context-aware search and insights. Its RAG pipeline uses a hybrid lexical plus on-the-fly chunking and reranking approach‚Äîachieving sub-2-second responses for 95% of queries‚Äîwhile ensuring data freshness via periodic syncs and webhooks. On top of that, Dash's Python-like DSL-based AI agents decompose complex, multi-step tasks into validated code plans, enabling reliable execution, explainability, and safe runtime enforcement. Together, these innovations boost productivity and collaboration, letting knowledge workers find, summarize, and act on information across any app without compromising security.

### Opinions & Advice

[### What Is Semantic Caching? (6 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-semantic-caching/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Escalating API costs, with single OpenAI queries reaching $3,500, are driving the adoption of semantic caching‚Äîan approach that reduces redundant AI calls by up to 68.8% and accelerates response times up to 9x compared to direct LLM queries. Semantic caching leverages vector embeddings to match semantically similar prompts, delivering cached responses for repeated queries and significantly lowering latency and compute expense. Solutions like Fastly's AI Accelerator and Redis LangCache illustrate low-effort integration options, making this tactic especially relevant in prompt-heavy, cost-sensitive environments such as customer service and retail. Implementing semantic caching promises substantial operational savings, faster user experiences, and cost-effective AI access as workloads scale.

[### Preventing Issues with Data Contracts & Testing (15 minute read)](https://thedataecosystem.substack.com/p/issue-45-data-contracts-testing?utm_source=tldrdata)

The critical shift from reactive data observability to proactive data quality management demands embedding data contracts and automated testing early in the data lifecycle. Data contracts establish explicit, business-led agreements on data semantics, structure, ownership, and quality, while quality gates and multi-layered testing (development, CI/CD, runtime, and scheduled) operationalize and enforce these standards across ingestion, transformation, and serving layers. This approach, enabled by modern platforms like Soda, not only reduces data downtime and alert fatigue but also clarifies ownership and accelerates root-cause resolution‚Äîessential for scaling trustworthy, business-aligned analytics and AI.
