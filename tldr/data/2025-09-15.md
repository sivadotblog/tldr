[### AI-Ready Data: A Technical Assessment. The Fuel and the Friction (14 minute read)](https://moderndata101.substack.com/p/ai-ready-data-a-technical-assessment?utm_source=tldrdata)

AI often fails not at the model layer but because the underlying data isn't AI-ready. Barriers include semantic ambiguity, poor quality, temporal misalignment, and inconsistent formats. Fixes require AI-native pipelines with built-in validation, aligned semantics, standardized schemas, and time-aware data flows. The key shift is treating data as a governed product, enabling reliability, reusability, and trust essential for AI at scale.

[### Next Gen Data Processing at Massive Scale at Pinterest with Moka (14 minute read)](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/next-gen-data-processing-at-massive-scale-at-pinterest-with-moka-part-2-of-2-d0210ded34e0?utm_source=tldrdata)

Moka, Pinterest's next-generation data processing platform built to replace the aging Hadoop-based Monarch system, has driven infrastructure modernization at Pinterest, including AWS multi-account setups, networking topology changes, pod-level identity management, and logging system enhancements. Moka also enables EKS adoption for other use cases like TiDB, Flink, Ray, and PyTorch.

[### Network and Storage Benchmarks for LLM Training on the Cloud (5 minute read)](https://maknee.github.io/blog/2025/Network-And-Storage-Training-Skypilot/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Network and storage infrastructure configuration has a decisive impact on distributed LLM training performance, yielding 6‚Äì10x speedups compared to default cloud settings. Benchmarks with Gemma 3 12B and GPT-OSS-120B showed that InfiniBand (400 GB/s) delivers 10x faster training than Ethernet, while optimized storage cuts checkpointing time in half. Benchmark results and configurations using Skypilot are linked in the article.

[### How to Tune Spark Shuffle Partitions (6 minute read)](https://www.confessionsofadataguy.com/how-to-tune-spark-shuffle-partitions/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Tuning Spark shuffle partitions is crucial to avoid performance issues: too few cause memory overload and slow tasks, while too many add scheduling overhead. Use Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) for automatic adjustments, aim for ~128 MB per partition, and monitor via Spark UI for skew or spills, while aligning with cluster cores (2‚Äì4 partitions per core) for optimal balance.

### Opinions & Advice

[### The Data Backbone of LLM Systems (51 minute presentation)](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/llm-data-code-model-prompt/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Most AI engineering today is less about ML and more about data, retrieval, and system design. RAG dominates as the core pattern, with effective systems built around a feature‚Äìtraining‚Äìinference‚Äìobservability architecture. Success hinges on decoupling ingestion from inference, versioning datasets, supporting reproducibility and experimentation, and treating observability as first-class. Agentic apps add memory and guardrails but remain software-engineering problems at heart.

[### Six KPIs Every Leader Should Track Across the Data Engineering Lifecycle (4 minute read)](https://www.eckerson.com/articles/six-kpis-every-leader-should-track-across-the-data-engineering-lifecycle?utm_source=tldrdata)

Measuring data engineering productivity requires tracking six critical lifecycle KPIs: percentage of requests tied to business value, planning accuracy, time-to-delivery, pipeline success rate, time-to-resolve incidents, and data product reuse rate. These metrics expose bottlenecks across intake, planning, development, testing, deployment, and feedback stages, highlighting hidden friction points missed by output metrics alone.

[### How Business Leaders are Using AI to Make Data-driven Decisions (4 minute read)](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/how-business-leaders-are-using-ai-to-make-data-driven-decisions/?utm_source=tldrdata)

AI enhances predictive analytics to forecast trends and risks, supercharges business intelligence by automating data analysis, improves customer understanding through sentiment analysis and behavioral insights, streamlines operations like supply chain management, and fosters a data-driven culture across organizations.

### Launches & Tools

[### You've got AI ambitions. Do you have the foundation to support them? (Sponsor)](https://www.cdata.com/events/foundations-2025/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=25Q3_Foundations_Event)

If you don't have a strong data foundation, you're building your analytics and AI on sand. At the upcoming [CData Foundations 2025 event (free, virtual)](https://www.cdata.com/events/foundations-2025/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=&utm_campaign=25Q3_Foundations_Event), you can hear directly from leaders at Google, AWS, Databricks, and ServiceNow on their approach to data strategy and AI-readiness.

[### Dockling (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/docling-project/docling?utm_source=tldrdata)

Docling processes diverse document formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, images, audio, etc.), extracting layout, tables, formulas, and more to produce a unified document representation. It integrates with tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and MCP servers for agentic workflows, supports air-gapped/local execution, and offers many export formats (Markdown, lossless JSON, etc.).

[### Announcing Spiral (5 minute read)](https://spiraldb.com/post/announcing-spiral?utm_source=tldrdata)

Spiral introduces a new data system for the "Third Age" of AI-driven workloads, using the Vortex file format to deliver 10-20x faster scans and 100-200x faster random reads compared to Parquet, enabling direct S3-to-GPU data transfer to fully utilize NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Backed by $22 million from Amplify Partners and General Catalyst, Spiral offers unified governance, secure "fearless permissioning," and a single API to handle diverse data types.

[### Get Excited About Postgres 18 (6 minute read)](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/get-excited-about-postgres-18?utm_source=tldrdata)

Postgres 18, to be released later this month, will introduce several compelling features: asynchronous I/O for faster reads (especially for sequential scans and bitmap heap scans), UUID v7 for better locality/indexing of time-based UUIDs, B-tree skip scans allowing multi-column indexes to be used when leading columns aren't supplied (in some cases), virtual generated columns by default (reducing storage & write overhead), and native OAuth 2.0 support in pg\_hba.conf. With 3,000 commits from 200+ contributors, even users who don't use all these features will benefit from general planner and performance improvements.

[### The Key to Production AI Agents: Evaluations (5 minute read)](https://www.databricks.com/blog/key-production-ai-agents-evaluations?utm_source=tldrdata)

AI Agents with generic metrics and informal "vibe checks" fail to address business-specific needs, leading to stalled GenAI projects. Effective evaluation involves task-level benchmarking, grounded assessments using enterprise context, and change tracking to ensure consistent, trustworthy performance, transforming agents into continuously improving systems.

[### Comparing EU and U.S. State Laws on AI: A Checklist for Proactive Compliance (1 minute read)](https://www.dataversity.net/comparing-eu-and-u-s-state-laws-on-ai-a-checklist-for-proactive-compliance?utm_source=tldrdata)

The EU AI Act creates the world's first comprehensive, enforceable AI regulation with a risk-tiered framework, sweeping obligations for high-risk and foundation models, and strict fines, while the U.S. pursues a patchwork of lighter, state-level laws. For multinationals, chasing minimum compliance across jurisdictions adds cost and risk. A more strategic path is adopting ‚ÄúEU-plus‚Äù governance globally (i.e., meeting the EU bar everywhere) to simplify operations, build trust, and turn compliance into a market differentiator.
