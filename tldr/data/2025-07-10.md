### Deep Dives

[### How Bolt Reconciles ‚Ç¨2B in Revenue Using Airflow, Spark, and dbt (8 minute read)](https://www.datatinkerer.io/p/how-bolt-reconciles-2b-in-revenue-using-airflow-spark-and-dbt?utm_source=tldrdata)

Bolt's data engineers built a six‚Äëstage pipeline (AWS Batch‚ÄØ+‚ÄØAirflow ‚Üí S3/Delta ‚Üí Spark‚ÄØ+‚ÄØdbt) that ingests raw PSP reports, normalizes schemas, and automatically reconciles every transaction and payout against internal ledgers and bank deposits. Dashboards and alerts surface mismatches, allocate opaque fees across regions, and give finance teams audit‚Äëready, near‚Äëreal‚Äëtime visibility with minimal manual effort.

[### When SIGTERM Does Nothing: A Postgres Mystery (15 minute read)](https://clickhouse.com/blog/sigterm-postgres-mystery?utm_source=tldrdata)

The ClickPipes team at ClickHouse identified a PostgreSQL bug where logical replication slot creation on read replicas resulted in unkillable queries that ignored SIGTERM signals. They traced the issue to a function in PostgreSQL's replication process, and collaborated with the community to develop a one-line fix.

[### Direct Data Sharing using Delta Sharing - Introduction: Our Journey to Empower Partners at Zalando (11 minute read)](https://engineering.zalando.com/posts/2025/07/direct-data-sharing-using-delta-sharing.html?utm_source=tldrdata)

Zalando adopted Delta Sharing to enable secure, direct data sharing across its data lake, streamlining collaboration with internal teams and external partners without complex ETL processes.

[### Mastering Postgres Replication Slots: Preventing WAL Bloat and Other Production Issues (8 minute read)](https://www.morling.dev/blog/mastering-postgres-replication-slots/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Replication slots in PostgreSQL ensure that the write-ahead log (WAL) segments are retained until processed by replication consumers, but improper management can lead to excessive WAL retention, causing disk space issues. Best practices for managing replication slots include using heartbeats, failover strategies, monitoring, and the pgoutput plug-in to prevent WAL bloat.

### Opinions & Advice

[### ‚ÄúThe First Data Hire‚Äù Series: How to Survive and Succeed as a Solo Data Leader (10 minute read)](https://seattledataguy.substack.com/p/the-first-data-hire-series-how-to?utm_source=tldrdata)

First data hires often face chaotic environments, competing priorities, and unrealistic expectations to quickly build robust infrastructure. Prioritize stakeholder discovery, develop a simple prioritization matrix, and focus on delivering actionable insights over architectural perfection so you start with what the business truly needs, not ‚Äúperfect‚Äù solutions. Communicate early wins, build strong relationships, maintain trust, and avoid dashboard sprawl.

[### Iceberg, The Right Idea ‚Äì The Wrong Spec ‚Äì Part 2 of 2: The Spec (15 minute read)](https://database-doctor.com/posts/iceberg-is-wrong-2.html?utm_source=tldrdata)

Iceberg's spec centralizes each table snapshot in a single metadata.json file that must be fully rewritten on every commit, forcing O(n) writes under contention and preventing cross-table transactions. This design generates explosive metadata bloat (potentially millions of manifest files and gigabytes of AVRO daily), necessitating costly cleanup that itself races with live writers. Read paths suffer from sequential HTTP manifest fetches, adding tens of milliseconds before data access. Ultimately, the file-only approach shifts transactional complexity to clients and requires external catalog stores, negating Iceberg's core premise.

[### Pendo's CEO on Monetizing an Analytics SaaS Product, Avoiding Dashboard Fatigue, and how AI Is Changing Product Work (45 minute podcast)](https://brian2r.podbean.com/e/173-pendo-s-ceo-on-monetizing-an-analytics-saas-product-avoiding-dashboard-fatigue-and-how-ai-is-changing-product-work/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Pendo evolved its analytics platform by simplifying dashboards and removing barriers to drive ‚Äútime to value‚Äù for mainstream users, while still preserving power-user capabilities through configurable experiences. CEO Todd Olson describes leveraging AI not just to surface insights but to explain them contextually within the UI, ensuring users understand recommendations without overwhelming them. Rather than measuring total time spent, Pendo prioritizes ‚Äústickiness‚Äù (frequent, brief check-ins that indicate genuine reliance on the product) engagement metrics.

[### From Medallion Architecture to Monetized Data Products: The Power of ODPS 4.0 (4 minute read)](https://blog.opendataproducts.org/from-medallion-architecture-to-monetized-data-products-the-power-of-odps-4-0-9fef754ca3da?utm_source=tldrdata)

Medallion Architecture structures data through staged refinement but lacks direct support for productization and monetization. The Open Data Product Specification (ODPS) 4.0 bridges this gap by introducing reusable components (to manage SLA, data quality, access, and payment profiles) using a modular, reference-based model for consistency and centralized governance. Integrating ODPS 4.0 with Medallion enables organizations to transform technical pipelines into governed, monetizable data products.

[### Crossing the Data Divide: Strategic Priorities for Data Leaders in 2026 (5 minute read)](https://tdan.com/crossing-the-data-divide-strategic-priorities-for-data-leaders-in-2026/32785?utm_source=tldrdata)

Rapid advances in AI, especially anticipated breakthroughs like ChatGPT-5 and the emergence of MCP servers, are driving a shift toward agent-centric, semi-autonomous data processes, poised to accelerate in 2027's ‚ÄúAgentic Reengineering Period.‚Äù Data leaders are urged to maintain rigorous investments in core data management (master data, governance, and integration) while diversifying pilot programs and preparing for significant process reengineering.

[### Unstructured Data Management at Scale (18 minute read)](https://piethein.medium.com/unstructured-data-management-at-scale-4c612f822f70?utm_source=tldrdata)

Managing unstructured data at scale is challenging due to limited best practices and the increasing demands of Generative AI, but the Medallion Architecture framework addresses this by translating data meaning across its layers. The Bronze layer focuses on extracting and organizing raw data, the Silver layer refines it into semantically meaningful units for AI use, and the Gold layer tailors it for specific applications, with a data marketplace enabling stakeholders to access AI-related insights for various use cases.
