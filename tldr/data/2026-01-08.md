### Deep Dives

[### Migration at Scale: Moving Marketing Cloud Caching from Memcached to Redis at 1.5M RPS Without Downtime (6 minute read)](https://engineering.salesforce.com/migration-at-scale-moving-marketing-cloud-caching-from-memcached-to-redis-at-1-5m-rps-without-downtime/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Salesforce's Marketing Cloud team executed a zero-downtime migration from Memcached to Redis Cluster, supporting 1.5 million cache events per second for over 50 services under live production traffic. The transition leveraged a Dynamic Cache Router, real-time routing, compatibility layers for TTL and key handling, and hot-key detection using a Count-Min Sketch model. End-to-end cache latency was consistently maintained at P50 ≈ 1 ms and P99 ≈ 20 ms, ensuring operational continuity.

[### From Local to Global: A Deep Dive into GraphRAG (8 minute read)](https://blog.gopenai.com/from-local-to-global-a-deep-dive-into-graphrag-1c50e2fc9e65?utm_source=tldrdata)

GraphRAG enhances conventional RAG by building a hierarchical knowledge graph from raw documents, enabling both granular local retrieval and global corpus-level reasoning for LLMs. GraphRAG synthesizes high-level insights and reduces hallucinations by using token-overlapping chunking, entity resolution, weighted relationships, and recursive community detection. The dual Local/Global retrieval modes resolve prior trade-offs between precision and corpus-wide understanding at the cost of pre-computation.

[### Autofilling the Boring Semantic Layer: From Sakila to Chat-BI with dltHub (12 minute read)](https://dlthub.com/blog/building-semantic-models-with-llms-and-dlt?utm_source=tldrdata)

Semantic layers should be simple, shared, and independent of any single BI tool so the same definitions work for dashboards, APIs, and AI. Using dlt for schema discovery, an LLM to draft the model, and a “boring” semantic layer, most of the semantic work is automated while keeping queries deterministic and debuggable. This enables reliable Chat-BI and multi-modal analytics from one source of truth without heavy infrastructure.

[### Powering Vector Embedding Capabilities (6 minute read)](https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/powering-vector-embedding-capabilities-12e8e1480f43?utm_source=tldrdata)

Expedia Group developed a centralized Embedding Store by extending the open-source Feast feature store with vector database capabilities, enabling efficient creation, management, versioning, and querying of vector embeddings for both real-time and batch workloads. This unified system supports similarity and hybrid searches with metadata filtering, and accelerates ML features like recommendations and semantic search across the company.

[### Data Engineering in 2026: What Changes? (4 minute read)](https://gradientflow.substack.com/p/data-engineering-for-machine-users?utm_source=tldrdata)

In the 2026 agent-native era, data engineering focuses on AI agents as the primary "machine users," prioritizing automation, reliability, and safety amid agents driving over 80% of new database creations and surging prompt volumes. Key shifts include modular PARK (PyTorch, AI Models, Ray, and Kubernetes) stacks, multimodal lakehouses, context stores for business logic, confidence-gated execution for safety, and ephemeral databases.

[### Context is the next data platform, and why context graphs are key to understanding processes (5 minute read)](https://www.glean.com/blog/context-data-platform?utm_source=tldrdata)

Context graphs help AI understand how work actually gets done by capturing real processes, relationships, and activity across enterprise tools, not just static data. By learning the repeated steps and patterns of work, AI agents can automate tasks more reliably and act in ways that match how an organization really operates. This makes context graphs a core part of a new data platform built specifically for agent-driven automation, not reporting.

[### The Hidden Cost Crisis in Data Engineering (5 minute read)](https://medium.com/@tabinashabr/the-hidden-cost-crisis-in-data-engineering-cfaf3fd14b8f?utm_source=tldrdata)

Data engineering teams face escalating cloud infrastructure costs due to unchecked tool sprawl, duplicated pipelines, and minimal cost accountability, often leading engineers to spend up to 60% of their time on maintenance instead of value-driving work. Implementing spend attribution, creating centralized platform teams, formalizing data contracts, and conducting regular audits have enabled organizations to cut infrastructure spend by 40-60% within a quarter.

[### How Multimodal Vector Databases Are Transforming Challenges Across Industries (12 minute read)](https://mlops.community/how-multimodal-vector-databases-are-transforming-challenges-across-industries/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Multimodal vector databases like ApertureDB natively handle diverse data types in a unified system, offering semantic search, graph-based relations, and full traceability for advanced cross-modal retrieval and complex queries. They tackle healthcare compliance challenges by automating the detection of regulatory omissions in drug advertisements, leveraging tools such as Unstructured.io, GPT-4o, and CLIP embeddings.

In 2025, PostgreSQL dominated with version 18 enhancements, major acquisitions (Databricks-Neon $1B and Snowflake-CrunchyData $250M), emerging sharding projects, and deeper cloud integrations. Trends included widespread Model Context Protocol (MCP) for LLM integration, new columnar formats, DBMS failures, and waning GPU hype.

[### How AI Transformed Database Debugging at Databricks (8 minute read)](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/how-ai-transformed-database-debugging?utm_source=tldrdata)

Databricks developed an internal AI-powered agentic platform that transforms database debugging for thousands of OLTP instances by enabling conversational, natural-language interactions with unified access to metrics, logs, and expert knowledge. This evolution from rigid checklists and anomaly detection to an interactive multi-agent system has reduced debugging time by up to 90%, allowing engineers to resolve complex issues more efficiently.

[### Mastering LLM Tool Calling: The Complete Framework for Connecting Models to the Real World (6 minute read)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/mastering-llm-tool-calling-the-complete-framework-for-connecting-models-to-the-real-world/?utm_source=tldrdata)

LLM tool calling is the mechanism enabling models to invoke external functions/APIs, turning static LLMs into dynamic agents for data access, computation, and real-world actions. It includes three pillars to build reliable, production-ready agents: Data Access (retrieval tools), Computation (precision processing), and Actions (effecting changes).
