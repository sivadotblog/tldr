[### How SQLite Is Powering the New Generation of Serverless Backends (7 minute read)](https://thinhdanggroup.github.io//sqlite-serverless-backend/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Modern serverless architectures are leveraging SQLite as a high-performance, globally distributed storage engine by wrapping it with platforms like Turso/libSQL, Cloudflare D1, and LiteFS. These solutions extend SQLite's durability and embedded nature by adding replication, edge distribution, and session-based consistency, enabling local, low-latency reads and synchronized writes via a primary node, all while minimizing operational complexity and cost. The shift enables “scale-to-zero” economics and simplifies deployment for read-heavy, multi-region backends, although single-writer replication models mean high-volume multi-region writes or conflict-free sync require more specialized data platforms. For classic SaaS and web app workloads: SQLite, when paired with the right distributed system wrapper, is now a practical, efficient backbone for serverless, edge-native data platforms.

[### Zoomer: Powering AI Performance at Meta's Scale Through Intelligent Debugging and Optimization (8 minute read)](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/11/21/data-infrastructure/zoomer-powering-ai-performance-meta-intelligent-debugging-optimization/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Meta's Zoomer is an automated, end-to-end platform for debugging and optimizing AI workloads. It has slashed training times (75% reduction for Ads relevance models, yielding 78% less power use) and boosted inference QPS by ~20% with a one-line code change that fixed inefficient memory copy, and enabled 25-30% speedups on massive 32k-64k GPU jobs, reducing environmental impact from trillions of daily inferences.

[### How Search Engines Actually Answer Your Questions (6 minute read)](https://hackernoon.com/how-search-engines-actually-answer-your-questions?utm_source=tldrdata)

Modern search Q&A systems leverage a hybrid architecture that combines knowledge graph-based QA (KBQA) for precision on structured facts with DeepQA and machine reading comprehension for coverage across unstructured web data. Production stacks employ fusion layers (meta-rankers evaluating relevance, freshness, and trust) while neural models enhance robustness via techniques like R-Drop and data augmentation. Key advances include generative readers for nuanced answers, HTML-aware encoding, structure-aware pretraining, and explicit evidence highlighting.

[### The Evolution of the Venice Ingestion Pipeline (15 minute read)](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/infrastructure/evolution-of-the-venice-ingestion-pipeline?utm_source=tldrdata)

LinkedIn's Venice ingestion pipeline is an open-source derived data storage system that serves as the backbone for online AI applications like People You May Know, feed recommendations, ads, and notifications. Launched in 2016, Venice now powers over 2,600 production stores, optimized for I/O, memory, and CPU efficiency across hybrid and active-active setups. It handles over 175 million key lookups per second and 230 million writes per second, all while maintaining a write latency SLA of under 10 minutes.

[### Metadata: How Data About Your Data is Optimal for AI (12 minute read)](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/metadata-how-data-about-your-data-is-optimal-for-ai/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Metadata is data about data that describes, categorizes, and tracks information through tags, lineage, and standardized glossaries, transforming raw datasets into rich, contextual sources that power accurate AI models. It serves as the foundational framework for AI pipelines by enabling efficiency through experiment tracking and schema standardization, ensuring reproducibility, and automating smarter feature selection and insights.

[### Building a Durable Execution Engine With SQLite (12 minute read)](https://www.morling.dev/blog/building-durable-execution-engine-with-sqlite/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Persistasaurus, a lightweight Durable Execution (DE) engine in Java using SQLite for persistence, ensures workflows resume from interruptions without re-executing completed steps by logging intents and outcomes for replay or resumption. Benefits include avoiding duplicates, capturing non-determinism, and enabling long-running processes to complete reliably.

[### The Dark Data Tax: How Hoarding is Poisoning Your AI (7 minute read)](https://www.dataengineeringweekly.com/p/the-dark-data-tax-how-hoarding-is?utm_source=tldrdata)

Enterprises now store 2.5x more data than in 2019, but only a fraction is actively analyzed, resulting in “data obesity”, where operational and cognitive costs far outweigh storage, which accounts for just 8% of ownership costs. Dark data (over 68% of stored data) degrades analytics and LLM performance, increasing compliance risks and engineering overhead. This post proposes a “Data Sustainability Index” metric based on how much compute data generates relative to the overall cost and complexity of the system as a key indicator to help organizations steer away from data hoarding and towards maximal data utility.

[### Data-at-Rest Encryption in DuckDB (22 minute read)](https://duckdb.org/2025/11/19/encryption-in-duckdb?utm_source=tldrdata)

DuckDB 1.4 introduces built-in data-at-rest encryption, allowing transparent AES-based protection of database files stored on disk. This feature simplifies secure analytics by encrypting the entire database (including WAL and temps), reducing threats from lost media or access breaches. It supports compliance, enables key-based read-only sharing, and maintains DuckDB's edge in portable, high-performance OLAP.

[### Grafana Mimir 3.0 Release: Performance Improvements, a New Query Engine, and More (5 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/11/03/grafana-mimir-3-0-release-all-the-latest-updates/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Grafana Mimir 3.0 introduces a fully decoupled architecture that separates ingestion from the query engine. Ingesters feed into Kafka and object storage, while a new streaming query engine handles data with dramatically lower memory usage (up to 92% less) and increased stability under load. Large deployments already report up to 15% lower resource usage with better reliability, making Mimir 3.0 a strong choice for large-scale metrics backends.

[### Have your Iceberg Cubed, Not Sorted: Meet Qbeast, the OTree Spatial Index (11 minute read)](https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2025/11/19/have-your-iceberg-cubed-not-sorted-meet-qbeast-the-otree-spatial-index?utm_source=tldrdata)

OTree is a lightweight, adaptive, multidimensional spatial index for Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake that dynamically shapes data layout using hypercube partitioning rather than static partitioning or sort order. It minimizes data drift, ensures efficient clustering, and adapts to evolving data distributions by recursively subdividing data space based on indexed column distributions. This approach aims to strike a balance between the database's classic B-tree clustered index and Open Table Format's upfront partitioning and sorting to maintain optimal data locality and decouple layout optimization from the query engines.
