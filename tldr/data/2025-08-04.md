[### How Wix Cut 50% of Its Data Platform Costs - Without Sacrificing Performance (7 minute read)](https://www.wix.engineering/post/how-wix-cut-50-of-our-data-platform-costs-without-sacrificing-performance-part-1?utm_source=tldrdata)

Wix's Data Infra group optimized its data platform, reducing monthly costs by 50% while maintaining performance by addressing challenges like multi-cloud management, improving cost visibility, and implementing standardized tagging and data-level usage attribution. It consolidated cost data from various cloud providers into its data lake, enabling better resource tracking and laying the groundwork for further cost-saving measures.

[### How we Discovered, and Recovered From, Postgres Corruption on the Matrix.org Homeserver (18 minute read)](https://matrix.org/blog/2025/07/postgres-corruption-postmortem/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Silent Postgres index corruption severely impacted Matrix services for 3 days. Standard tools like pg\_amcheck missed the fault. pageinspect and custom sampling revealed dangling index pointers. Recovery required a full REINDEX of the 4 TB index, restoring data from backup, and adding constraints to safeguard against deletion. Proactively schedule REINDEX/integrity checks, use page-level inspections, enforce protective constraints, and validate backups.

[### Building Reproducible ML Systems with Apache Iceberg and SparkSQL: Open Source Foundations (14 minute read)](https://www.infoq.com/articles/reproducible-ml-iceberg/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Apache Iceberg and SparkSQL enable reproducible ML systems by offering time travel, schema evolution, and ACID transactions, addressing data drift, versioning, and consistency issues that traditional data lakes struggle with. Apache Iceberg boosts ML reproducibility by integrating with feature stores to deliver consistent historical and real-time features while leveraging temporal partitioning for efficient data access in training on historical data and predicting with recent data.

### Opinions & Advice

[### Data Quality For Unbiased Results: Preventing AI-induced Hallucinations (4 minute read)](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/data-quality-for-unbiased-results-preventing-ai-induced-hallucinations/?utm_source=tldrdata)

High-quality, unbiased data paired with proactive data quality management is crucial for preventing AI hallucinations. Leveraging metadata-rich datasets, automated profiling, cleaning, and enrichment processes, along with validation against trusted reference data and observable supervision using expert semantic tools like ontologies and GraphRAG, helps detect and correct errors for dependable AI results.

[### Anyone Else Struggling to Keep Up With Data Tools (10 minute read)](https://seattledataguy.substack.com/p/anyone-else-struggling-to-keep-up?utm_source=tldrdata)

Staying current in data engineering is increasingly unmanageable due to the rapid proliferation of new technologies, making mastery of every tool unrealistic, even for consultants. Focus on solidifying foundational skills like SQL and systems thinking, then select 1-2 technologies annually to master in depth through real-world projects and structured reflection. Prioritize deep work, intentional reading over passive consumption, hands-on experimentation, and ideally, write to cement knowledge.

[### Can Analysis Ever be Automated? (12 minute read)](https://benn.substack.com/p/can-analysis-ever-be-automated?utm_source=tldrdata)

Analysis, unlike software, can't be self-validated. Its accuracy depends entirely on the methods, data, and assumptions used. AI tools like Shortcut automate complex financial models and spreadsheets, but without transparency or manual verification, trusting their correctness is inherently difficult. Unlike applications where functionality confirms validity, analytical outputs require scrutiny or blind trust. Thus, automation paradoxically increases reliance on credibility rather than verifiable correctness.
