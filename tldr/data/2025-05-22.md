### Deep Dives

[### How Pinterest Accelerates ML Feature Iterations via Effective Backfill (12 minute read)](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-pinterest-accelerates-ml-feature-iterations-via-effective-backfill-d67ea125519c?utm_source=tldrdata)

Pinterest's Feature Backfill speeds up ML development by precomputing historical feature values offline and merging them with training data, cutting iteration time and cost by up to 90x. The first version used Spark for full backfills but was costly because of heavy data shuffling. Version 2 splits the work into two Iceberg-based stages, boosting speed and cutting storage by 75%. Engineers can now define ‚Äúon-demand‚Äù features as Spark transforms that compute only during training, and a future Ray-powered option will enable real-time joins.

[### The Lost Decade of Small Data? (9 minute read)](https://duckdb.org/2025/05/19/the-lost-decade-of-small-data.html?utm_source=tldrdata)

DuckDB handled a 6 billion-row TPC-H SF1000 benchmark smoothly on a 2012 MacBook Pro, and on a modern M3 Max MacBook Pro, it's up to 20√ó faster. Since most cloud queries (100 MB‚Äì300 GB) easily fit on a single node, this shows that today's laptops can tackle serious analytics. In other words, hardware has outpaced dataset growth, making tools like DuckDB a practical choice without needing distributed systems.

[### Exploring Joins and Changelogs in Flink SQL (20 minute read)](https://rmoff.net/2025/05/20/exploring-joins-and-changelogs-in-flink-sql/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Apache Flink SQL blurs the line between batch and streaming paradigms by treating all data as dynamic tables, supporting both bounded and unbounded sources. To manage evolving data states, Flink utilizes changelogs (+I, -D, +U, and -U) and introduces temporal joins leveraging event-time semantics and watermarks, allowing precise control over join logic and state retention. Correct configuration of watermarks, idle timeouts, and upsert vs. append semantics are essential to preventing unbounded state growth and inconsistent join outputs.

[### Beyond Query Optimization: Aurora Postgres Connection Pooling with SQLAlchemy & RDSProxy (13 minute read)](https://eng.lyft.com/beyond-query-optimization-aurora-postgres-connection-pooling-with-sqlalchemy-rdsproxy-200db7f562d7?utm_source=tldrdata)

At Lyft, adding RDS Proxy connection pooling to Aurora PostgreSQL cut writer connections by 56% and reader connections by 16%, reaching about a 4.4 multiplexing ratio once session pinning was fixed. Before that, SQLAlchemy's default pool was opening and closing too many connections in a high-traffic, serverless setup, hitting Aurora's limits. RDS Proxy now batches client requests on fewer database connections, boosting scalability, lowering CPU usage and lock contention, and letting Lyft run on smaller, cheaper instances.

### Opinions & Advice

[### What the Heck is Open Metadata? (8 minute read)](https://hackernoon.com/what-the-heck-is-open-metadata?utm_source=tldrdata)

OpenMetadata is an open-source metadata platform that centralizes asset discovery, lineage, quality checks, and governance through a relational ‚Äúmetadata store,‚Äù a pluggable ingestion framework with 90+ connectors, JSON schemas, and a React-based UI. Its lightweight, schema-first design and collaboration features give data engineers a single source of truth for tracing pipelines, automating governance, and improving team workflows.

[### The AI Engineering Stack (10 minute read)](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-ai-engineering-stack?utm_source=tldrdata)

The AI stack consists of three layers: application development for integrating AI models into products via APIs and user interfaces, model development for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating models, and infrastructure for model serving and compute management. Unlike traditional ML engineering, AI engineering focuses on adapting pre-trained foundation models, managing larger, compute-intensive models with higher latency, and evaluating open-ended outputs, requiring expertise in GPU clusters and efficient inference.

[### Postgres to ClickHouse: Simplifying the Modern Data Stack with Aaron Katz & Sai Krishna Srirampur (34 minute podcast)](https://datastackshow.com/podcast/postgres-to-clickhouse-simplifying-the-modern-data-stack-with-aaron-katz-sai-krishna-srirampur/?utm_source=tldrdata)

ClickHouse started at Yandex in 2008 as an open-source, columnar database built for lightning-fast analytics. Today, ClickHouse Inc. runs ClickHouse Cloud, which is a managed service trusted by 1,000+ customers (like Twilio and Roblox) for low-latency, cost-effective queries. Its ClickPipes tool (from PeerDB) uses change-data-capture to pull data from systems such as PostgreSQL, replicating terabytes in real time for instant analysis.

[### The Open Table Format Revolution: Why Hyperscalers Are Betting on Managed Iceberg (20 minute read)](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/open-table-format-revolution/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Hyperscalers are embracing managed Iceberg tables to deliver open, ACID-compliant lakehouse storage on object stores with built-in catalog, compaction, and time-travel features. This is unlocking cost savings, vendor independence, and polyglot SQL engine support. The ‚ÄúICE Stack‚Äù (Interoperable, Composable, and Efficient) layers object storage, file formats, table formats, and catalogs to let data teams swap engines, automate governance, and scale analytics without lock-in.

### Launches & Tools

[### Microsoft Build 2025: News and Announcements from the Developer Conference (13 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/news/669382/microsoft-build-2025-news-ai-agents?utm_source=tldrdata)

Microsoft Build 2025 unveiled a suite of AI-driven enhancements across Windows and developer tools. Highlights include a macOS-style cross-device resume and AI actions in File Explorer to a new ‚Äúedit‚Äù CLI text editor, open-sourcing WSL, and native Model Context Protocol support. On the cloud side, Microsoft opened its Edge browser to on-device AI APIs, added Grok 3 to Azure AI Foundry, and doubled down on AI agents and services across Windows and Azure.

[### Introducing AI.GENERATE\_TABLE: Creating Structured Data from Gen AI Models in BigQuery (7 minute read)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/convert-ai-generated-unstructured-data-to-a-bigquery-table?utm_source=tldrdata)

BigQuery's new AI.GENERATE\_TABLE() function lets you call Gemini 2.5 models directly from SQL to turn unstructured inputs into fully typed BigQuery tables based on your schema. This makes it easy for data engineers to extract fields (e.g., city names and medical vitals) into columns and arrays without manual parsing, streamlining analysis in existing pipelines.

[### 100 Things Google Announced at I/O (13 minute read)](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-io-2025-all-our-announcements/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Google I/O 2025 doubled down on embedding generative AI across Google's stack bringing Gemini 2.5 into Search, new AI modes for Shopping and Live camera queries, and flow‚Äêbased tools like Flow and Veo 3 for video, plus data-centric upgrades in Vertex AI (MCP support, thought summaries, and 2.5 Flash/Pro with token budgets). Developers and data engineers get enhanced model APIs, AI Studio/UI improvements, NotebookLM and Colab agentic workflows, plus new open models (Gemma, MedGemma, and SignGemma) and agent frameworks (ADK and A2A) to build next-gen AI pipelines.

### Miscellaneous

[### Data Commons Can Save Open AI (5 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/data-commons-can-save-open-ai/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Open-source AI lacks diverse, high-quality training data. A new OSI report urges creating data commons with clear provenance, licensing, privacy, and equity to break data monopolies and curb ethical risks.

[### When the Dead Won't Die (5 minute read)](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/when-the-dead-wont-die/?utm_source=tldrdata)

PostgreSQL's VACUUM (and autovacuum) skips index cleanup when dead tuples stay below 2% of pages and TID storage under 32 MB, leaving LP\_DEAD pointers in pg\_stat\_user\_tables. Turning on INDEX\_CLEANUP forces removal but can overload large, write-heavy tables.
