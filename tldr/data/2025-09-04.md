### Deep Dives

[### Understanding Apache Fluss (26 minute read)](https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2025/9/2/understanding-apache-fluss?utm_source=tldrdata)

Apache Fluss is an emerging low-latency disaggregated table storage engine purpose-built for Apache Flink that offers both append-only and primary key tables with efficient changelog capabilities. This addresses the latency and changelog limitations of Apache Paimon for real-time analytics. Fluss features a cluster of tablet and coordinator servers and columnar Arrow IPC storage with projection pushdown. It integrates seamlessly with object stores and lakehouse formats like Paimon. Its hybrid architecture enables unified, efficient access to both hot and historical data, empowering fast lookup joins and offloading Flink job state to shared tables.

[### Iceberg MoR the Hard Way: StarRocks Code Dive (13 minute read)](https://medium.com/fresha-data-engineering/iceberg-mor-the-hard-way-starrocks-code-dive-fee5e1be66f5?utm_source=tldrdata)

StarRocks simplifies Iceberg's complex Merge-on-Read semantics by cleanly splitting responsibilities: the frontend handles metadata, routing, and MoR logic, while the backend just runs simple primitives like bitmap scans for positional deletes and anti-joins for equality deletes. Queues and incremental processing ensure parallelism and bounded memory. This MoR design reduces runtime flexibility (vs. engines like Spark or Trino) in exchange for predictable, efficient execution.

[### Flink State Management: A Journey from Core Primitives to Next-Generation Incremental Computation (15 minute read)](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/flink-state-management-a-journey-from-core-primitives-to-next-generation-incremental-computation_602503?utm_source=tldrdata)

Apache Flink's state management has evolved from embedded local state in Flink 1.x, using JVM heap and local disks, to a cloud-native disaggregated architecture in Flink 2.0 with the ForSt backend, enabling unlimited state capacity, zero-copy operations, instant recovery, and efficient resource utilization. Future generic incremental computation aims to unify stream and batch processing for cost-effective, real-time analytics.

Wix cut its data platform costs by 50% without sacrificing performance by implementing job-level telemetry, assigning clear ownership to data lake schemas, and creating a simple pricing model based on storage and CPU usage. It also introduced efficiency KPIs, built actionable Grafana dashboards, and fostered ongoing cost optimization through team engagement and infrastructure improvements like data compaction and tiered storage.

### Opinions & Advice

[### Meta's Data Scientist's Framework for Navigating Product Strategy as Data Leaders (7 minute read)](https://medium.com/@AnalyticsAtMeta/data-scientists-framework-for-navigating-product-strategy-as-data-leaders-2eb62b20f505?utm_source=tldrdata)

Meta's Data Scientist's Framework guides data scientists in shaping product strategy across four scenarios: Pioneer (low data, broad problem), Craftsperson (low data, concrete problem), Explorer (high data, broad problem), and Optimizer (high data, concrete problem). The framework uses a tailored approach that involves setting North Star metrics, designing data collection, identifying patterns, and optimizing with continuous learning.

[### What I've Learned Designing Data Systems (4 minute read)](https://sqlpatterns.com/p/what-ive-learned-designing-data-systems?utm_source=tldrdata)

Modular data system design remains crucial as evolving business requirements demand flexibility, with modular, self-contained components enabling independent development and easier maintenance. Adopting functional architectures significantly reduces operational pain and shifts focus from compute/storage cost to engineering time. Design the data model upfront and set on a modeling strategy that aligns with specific analytic goals.

[### Benchmarking Spark Library with JMH (8 minute read)](https://semyonsinchenko.github.io/ssinchenko/post/spark-and-jmh/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Spark's memory allocation via spark-submit is incompatible with JMH. Leverage JMH's feature to fork a new JVM with custom Java options like -Xmx10g to address OutOfMemory errors during GraphFrames benchmarking in an existing JVM. This will ensure sufficient memory allocation.

### Launches & Tools

[### DocumentDB and the Future of Open Source (6 minute read)](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2025/09/02/documentdb/?utm_source=tldrdata)

The Linux Foundation has taken stewardship of DocumentDB, a MongoDB-compatible database built on PostgreSQL. Unlike MongoDB's proprietary path, DocumentDB aims to keep the document model within an open, multi-vendor ecosystem, similar to how PostgreSQL itself thrived. This could be a pivotal moment for document workloads, offering open-standard alternatives that reduce lock-in while leveraging PostgreSQL's reliability and tooling.

[### drawDB (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/drawdb-io/drawdb?utm_source=tldrdata)

drawDB is a browser-based tool to design and visualize database schemas with ease. You can build entity‚Äërelationship charts, export DDLs, and share or embed diagrams. It's open-source, supports specific MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server syntaxes, and works offline.

[### CSV Everything (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/matsonj/csv-everything?utm_source=tldrdata)

CSV Everything is a Chrome Extension that converts images of tables or charts into downloadable CSV files using the OpenRouter API. It supports clipboard image input, customizable AI models and prompts, and integrates natively with Chrome's download system.

[### Lessons on Building an AI Data Analyst (16 minute read)](https://www.pedronasc.com/articles/lessons-building-ai-data-analyst?utm_source=tldrdata)

Building an effective AI data analyst requires more than just text-to-SQL capabilities. It involves creating a multi-step analysis workflow that integrates context and external tools. A robust semantic layer enhances data understanding and reduces SQL complexity, while a multi-agent system optimizes retrieval and reasoning to deliver precise, actionable insights. Continuous evaluation and performance tuning are essential to meet user expectations for quality and responsiveness.

Instagram has implemented a diversity-aware notification ranking framework that overlays a multiplicative penalty on traditional ML engagement scores, factoring in content, author, type, and product surface similarity. This approach leverages Maximal Marginal Relevance to dynamically downrank repetitive notifications, effectively reducing daily notification volume while boosting click-through rates.
