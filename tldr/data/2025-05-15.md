### Opinions & Advice

[### Practical Data Modeling with dbt: Star vs. Snowflake Compared (10 minute read)](https://p-munhoz.github.io/blog/dbt/star-vs-snowflake-schema-dbt?utm_source=tldrdata)

This hands-on review compares star and snowflake schemas in data modeling, focusing on their differences in normalization and performance. Star schemas prioritize query speed and ease for BI tools but require more storage due to redundancy. In contrast, snowflake schemas reduce redundancy and improve data integrity but introduce complexity in queries and performance. The decision between them depends on analytical needs, team workflows, and performance requirements.

[### Example - Building a Traditional Data Model (10 minute read)](https://practicaldatamodeling.substack.com/p/example-building-a-traditional-data?utm_source=tldrdata)

Most data modeling tasks occur in brownfield environments, requiring reverse engineering to document and refine existing conceptual, logical, and physical models. Effective modeling hinges on translating stakeholder language into clear, business-aligned entities, attributes, and relationships, highlighting divergent definitions and semantic alignment between business and technical teams. This collaborative approach mitigates risks like poor data quality and performance, supporting analytics and ML pipelines. Systematically layering conceptual, logical, and physical models, platform-agnostic at first, ensures robust documentation, governance, and future-proofed data architectures.

[### Why CDAIOs Are Losing Sleep‚ÄîTop 3 Priorities for 2025 (5 minute read)](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-top-3-ai-problems-to-solve?utm_source=tldrdata)

Data and AI leaders face three critical challenges in 2025: managing unreliable data lakes, handling resource constraints like token limits, and mitigating AI hallucinations. Unreliable data lakes, often described as "swamps," undermine AI reliability, requiring robust data observability to ensure trusted outputs. Resource constraints, such as token limits, demand optimized data pipelines to maximize efficiency, while hallucinations necessitate improved context curation and validation to enhance model accuracy.

### Launches & Tools

[### Why Compilers Matter (w/ Lukas Schulte) (42 minute podcast)](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/why-compilers-matter-w-lukas-schulte?utm_source=tldrdata)

dbt Labs recently acquired SDF Labs, signaling a transformative push toward a unified, warehouse-agnostic SQL compiler, aiming to abstract away warehouse-specific SQL dialect fragmentation. By leveraging concepts familiar from Low Level Virtual Machines and modern language ecosystems, SDF's compiler introduces a shared intermediate representation, enabling portable logic, reusable SQL libraries, and robust package management across platforms like BigQuery, Snowflake, and Redshift. This evolution promises to streamline analytics pipelines, boost developer productivity, and open the door to an open, interoperable data ecosystem.

[### How to Get Ready for the New dbt Engine (6 minute read)](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/how-to-get-ready-for-the-new-dbt-engine?utm_source=tldrdata)

The upcoming dbt engine upgrade, launching on May 28, will deliver significant improvements, including faster development, better cost efficiency, and enhanced SQL comprehension. Users will benefit from features like live error detection, smart autocomplete, and automatic orchestration to reduce warehouse costs. To prepare, teams should upgrade to dbt Core v1.10 and resolve any deprecation warnings.

[### QCon London 2025: How to Build a Database Without a Server (3 minute read)](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/05/serverless-database-seaton/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Man Group presented a migration of a hedge fund trading application from a high-maintenance MongoDB cluster to a serverless database using object storage and Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for simplified scalability. The serverless approach, defined as a software library paired with object storage, adjusts capacity dynamically based on application demands, addressing issues like clock drift with system or storage clocks. CRDTs enable convergent, commutative updates across replicas without coordination, ensuring consistency.

[### Ask a Data Ethicist: Is Consent the Wrong Approach for Modern Data Regulation? (6 minute read)](https://www.dataversity.net/ask-a-data-ethicist-is-consent-the-wrong-approach-for-modern-data-regulation/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Traditional consent-based data governance is increasingly inadequate due to complex power imbalances, opaque data-sharing practices, and harm propagation through inferred data patterns. Individual consent cannot address downstream impacts on non-consenting users when predictive models act on relational or "data like mine" inferences, leading to exclusion or other harms beyond the original data subject. For data leaders, this highlights the need to shift from user-centric control toward institutional, population-level governance frameworks that better mediate data risks and maximize societal benefit.
