### Deep Dives

[### Zero-Downtime Cassandra Migration Between EKS Clusters (8 minute read)](https://engineering.monday.com/zero-downtime-cassandra-migration-between-eks-clusters/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Monday.com executed a zero-downtime, zero-data-loss migration of production K8ssandra clusters from legacy EKS to modern clusters, leveraging Cassandra's native multi-data-center support. Its team spun up new DCs in the target clusters, linked them via gossip and shared config, streamed and repaired data with automated Temporal workflows, gradually rerouted traffic, adjusted replication factors, and then decommissioned the old nodes.

[### Healing Tables: When Day-by-Day Backfills Become a Slow-Motion Disaster (9 minute read)](https://ghostinthedata.info/posts/2026/2026-02-07-self-healing/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Healing Tables approaches historical data management by enabling deterministic, fully reproducible builds directly from source data, eliminating compounding errors inherent to traditional incremental loading. The algorithm consists of six steps: effectivity table generation, time slicing, unified source joining, hash-based change detection, consecutive row compression, and validation. This effectively decouples change detection from valid time period construction and allows arbitrary historical reprocessing in a single pass.

[### The Data Canary: How Netflix Validates Catalog Metadata (6 minute read)](https://netflixtechblog.medium.com/the-data-canary-how-netflix-validates-catalog-metadata-18b699d58e36?utm_source=tldrdata)

Netflix engineered an automated data canary system that validates catalog metadata transformations using live production traffic, detecting data corruption and blocking bad data within a 10-minute window. The pipeline employs dedicated baseline/canary clusters, session affinity, chaos experiments, and real-time behavioral metrics to prioritize detecting customer impact. The approach ensures that data deployments receive the same rigor as code.

[### Next Generation DB Ingestion at Pinterest (11 minute read)](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/next-generation-db-ingestion-at-pinterest-66844b7153b7?utm_source=tldrdata)

Pinterest replaced a legacy batch-based database ingestion pipeline with a unified, CDC-based streaming system. Using Debezium/TiCDC for change capture, Kafka for streaming, Flink/Spark for processing, and Iceberg tables with bucketing, bucket joins, and merge-on-read optimizations, its team delivered 15-minute to 1-hour end-to-end latencies, true incremental updates with deletions, at-least-once semantics, and 40% compute cost reduction.

### Opinions & Advice

[### How Not to Run an Open Standards Initiative (7 minute read)](https://fieldnotesondata.substack.com/p/how-not-to-run-an-open-standards?utm_source=tldrdata)

OSI is an open standard for semantic layer interoperability, but in practice, it fails due to vendor capture, weak governance, and a lack of neutral stewardship or migration paths. Open standards succeed through trust, incentives, and institutional design, not by publishing a spec.

[### Understanding the Data Warehouse Dilemma (3 minute read)](https://goodstrat.com/2026/02/06/understanding-the-data-warehouse-dilemma-2026-02-07/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Most “data warehouse” pain isn't tech: it's unresolved business semantics. When teams can't agree on what numbers mean, trust collapses, no matter if it's Teradata, Snowflake, or “unified” platforms. Data warehousing should be rewarded for commercial clarity (negotiated meaning), not architectural purity, otherwise you just build expensive, well-governed museums that nobody uses.

[### Beyond the Warehouse: Why BigQuery Alone Won't Solve Your Data Problems (44 minute video)](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/bigquery-data-challenges/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Data warehouses like BigQuery work well initially but eventually hit architectural breaking points with issues like high latency, escalating costs from scaling compute, data disorganization, and teams bypassing the warehouse, such as ML groups building custom pipelines. Instead, adopting a conceptual three-layer data lifecycle (Raw, Curated, Use Case) can better control lineage, reduce duplication, and enable flexibility for diverse needs.

### Launches & Tools

[### Introducing uForwarder: The Consumer Proxy for Kafka Async Queuing (9 minute read)](https://www.uber.com/blog/introducing-ufowarder/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Uber has open-sourced uForwarder, a push-based Kafka proxy that already powers 1,000+ consumer services and trillions of messages daily. It pulls from Kafka via binary protocol, pushes messages individually over gRPC, aggregates acks for safe commits, and adds powerful features like context-aware routing, active head-of-line blocking mitigation with dead-letter queues, adaptive rebalancing, and partition pausing.

[### dbt Defer: Speed Up CI/CD Pipelines and Slash Compute Costs by 75% (5 minute read)](https://blog.pmunhoz.com/dbt/dbt-defer-optimize-cicd-pipelines?utm_source=tldrdata)

Implementing dbt's defer feature in CI pipelines dramatically accelerates builds and reduces cloud compute costs by 60–80%, as it reuses existing production artifacts and rebuilds only modified models instead of the entire dependency chain. By storing and referencing production manifest files, teams can achieve up to a 75% runtime reduction on small projects and cut 20-minute builds to under 5 minutes on enterprise-scale warehouses. Defer supports advanced patterns, including integration with local development and selective full refreshes, while requiring careful manifest and schema management to avoid pitfalls.

[### Make Your AI Better at Data Work With dbt's Agent Skills (14 minute read)](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-agent-skills?utm_source=tldrdata)

dbt Labs open-sourced a collection of dbt agent skills to enhance AI coding agents by embedding dbt best practices, transforming generalist tools into specialized data agents for analytics engineering tasks. These skills cover key areas like full analytics workflows, semantic layer management, platform operations, and migrations.

[### The “Store Everything” Cloud Model Is Breaking Under Modern AI Workloads (6 minute read)](https://hackernoon.com/the-store-everything-cloud-model-is-breaking-under-modern-ai-workloads?utm_source=tldrdata)

Enterprises are abandoning the outdated “store everything, analyze later” cloud model, as nearly 70% of observability data is deemed waste, inflating storage costs and cloud latency. By implementing AI Edge Proxies (such as local neural network filters on industrial hardware), organizations limit log ingestion to actual anomalies, reducing cloud storage, transfer, and analysis costs by 40-60%. This edge-first approach enables real-time insights, slashes outage repercussions, tightens security, and aligns with trends towards on-prem and workload repatriation.

[### The ‘Super Bowl' standard: Architecting distributed systems for massive concurrency (9 minute read)](https://www.infoworld.com/article/4127318/the-super-bowl-standard-architecting-distributed-systems-for-massive-concurrency.html?utm_source=tldrdata)

Surviving extreme load events like the “Super Bowl standard” requires more than auto-scaling. Critical architectural patterns include aggressive load shedding based on business priority, strict tenancy isolation (bulkheads/circuit breakers), and sophisticated request collapsing to prevent cache stampedes. These strategies, combined with regular “game day” drills that simulate 50%+ above-peak loads, ensure systems fail gracefully, maintaining core functionality under duress.
