### Deep Dives

[### Ray Data, Train & Tune at Klaviyo (5 minute read)](https://klaviyo.tech/ray-data-train-tune-at-klaviyo-bca9f14abf21?utm_source=tldrdata)

Klaviyo uses the open-source Ray framework for efficient, scalable machine learning workflows, addressing bottlenecks in data preprocessing, training, and hyperparameter tuning. Ray Data accelerates preprocessing via parallelism and distributed computation. Ray Train simplifies distributed training across GPUs and CPUs. Ray Tune optimizes hyperparameters through parallel trials, significantly reducing model development time. Together, these components provide Klaviyo with a cost-efficient and scalable platform for its machine learning workflows.

[### 3 pandas Workflows That Slowed to a Crawl on Large Datasets‚ÄîUntil We Turned on GPUs (4 minute read)](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/3-pandas-workflows-that-slowed-to-a-crawl-on-large-datasets-until-we-turned-on-gpus/?utm_source=tldrdata)

GPU acceleration significantly enhances the performance of common pandas workflows on large datasets, enabling operations that traditionally slow down to execute up to 30x faster. Key use cases include analyzing time-series stock data, processing text-heavy job postings, and building responsive interactive dashboards, all of which benefit from NVIDIA cuDF without requiring code rewrites. Additionally, Unified Virtual Memory allows processing of datasets exceeding GPU memory limits, facilitating the management of large DataFrames. This deep dive contains additional videos and code examples.

[### Context Engineering: 2025's #1 Skill in AI (9 minute read)](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/context-engineering-2025s-1-skill?utm_source=tldrdata)

Context engineering has emerged as the critical discipline for maximizing LLM performance, moving beyond static prompt engineering to architecting dynamic, task-specific context pipelines. Key strategies such as selective RAG retrieval, context compression, structured outputs, and multi-agent separation address context window limits, reduce hallucinations, and optimize cost and latency.

### Opinions & Advice

[### SQL Injection as a Feature (8 minute read)](https://idiallo.com/blog/sql-injection-as-a-feature?utm_source=tldrdata)

An application initially designed with a structured report generation feature devolved into a SQL Injection As A Service model, allowing users to directly input SQL queries due to incremental feature requests over a decade. This evolution highlights the risks of insufficient input validation and the need for robust database security practices, as user demands led to exposing the entire database.

[### Atlassian Research: AI Adoption is Rising, But Friction Persists (5 minute read)](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/developer/developer-experience-report-2025?utm_source=tldrdata)

According to Atlassian's recent survey, 68 percent of developers report saving over 10 hours weekly from AI tools, primarily in non-coding tasks. On the flip side, the top time-wasters for developers are finding information (services, docs, and APIs), adapting new technology, and context switching between tools. These are areas where AI can potentially improve developer experience.

[### Why Good Data Doesn't Guarantee Good Decisions (4 minute read)](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/why-good-data-doesnt-guarantee-good-decisions/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Data professionals need to focus on making insights actionable, not just generating them. This involves framing forecasts around decisions, providing context in dashboards, considering multiple interpretations of data, and ultimately acting as strategic enablers who design their work to facilitate better decision-making rather than simply providing raw data.

[### Why Startups Are Betting Everything on Apache DataFusion (5 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/why-startups-are-betting-everything-on-apache-datafusion/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Apache DataFusion is emerging as a crucial open-source library for building high-performance analytic systems. It's being adopted by startups, established companies, and open-source projects to create innovative data solutions, offering the performance of expensive proprietary systems with a lower barrier to entry and the benefits of community-driven development.

### Miscellaneous

[### Agent Infrastructure and Control Planes (5 minute read)](https://www.datagravity.dev/p/agent-infrastructure-and-control?utm_source=tldrdata)

As LLM inference matures and costs drop, enterprise focus is shifting to agent orchestration, memory, durability, and governance, requiring a whole new infrastructure stack. Critical areas include composable agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain), stochastic workflow orchestrators, robust agent memory layers, UI automation via headless browser protocols, and agent-native security/auth. No single vendor owns this space yet, and the battle for dominance has begun.
