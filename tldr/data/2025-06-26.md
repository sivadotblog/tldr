### Deep Dives

[### Why Apache Spark is Often Considered as Slow? (21 minute read)](https://semyonsinchenko.github.io/ssinchenko/post/why-spark-is-slow/?utm_source=tldrdata)

OSS Vanilla Spark is a versatile, hybrid distributed query engine that supports diverse workloads, including OLAP on data warehouses and semi-structured data processing. However, its unified design makes it slower than specialized vectorized engines like Trino or Snowflake for OLAP queries on columnar data. Through the Catalyst Extensions API, solutions like Databricks Photon, Apache Gluten, and Apache Datafusion Comet transform Spark into a pure vectorized engine by replacing code generation with vectorized execution, leveraging frameworks like VeloxDB, ClickHouse, or Datafusion for improved performance.

[### Hands-on with Apache Iceberg (71 minute video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XluBSLT60h8&amp;utm_source=tldrdata)

Apache Iceberg is a metadata-driven table format that lets data teams write once to object storage and query the same data from engines such as Trino, Polars, DuckDB, or Spark while supporting hidden partitioning, snapshot time travel, schema evolution, and branch-style rollbacks. A UK housing demo illustrates these features in practice by adding columns without rewrites, switching partitions, cleaning small files, tagging snapshots, and streaming Kafka events straight into Iceberg, delivering zero-copy analytics and simpler pipeline maintenance.

[### Scaling Pinterest ML Infrastructure with Ray: From Training to End-to-End ML Pipelines (8 minute read)](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/scaling-pinterest-ml-infrastructure-with-ray-from-training-to-end-to-end-ml-pipelines-4038b9e837a0?utm_source=tldrdata)

Pinterest achieved a 10x time reduction in ML iteration by integrating Ray across the entire ML infrastructure stack (from feature engineering and sampling to labeling) beyond training/batch inference workflows. The company optimized data ingestion with Iceberg write mechanisms and achieved 90% of roofline throughput in the homefeed ranking model training pipeline.

[### How Skroutz Handles Real-time Schema Evolution in Amazon Redshift with Debezium (7 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/how-skroutz-handles-real-time-schema-evolution-in-amazon-redshift-with-debezium/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Skroutz streamlined real-time schema evolution for its Redshift data warehouse using Debezium CDC with Kafka, capturing schema changes from MariaDB and MongoDB without blocking development or risking data loss. Schema additions are logged in a SUPER-typed JSON column and surfaced for manual intervention via automated alerts, minimizing coordination requirements.

### Opinions & Advice

[### The Hidden Cost of Over-instrumentation: Why More Tracking Can Hurt Product Teams (4 minute read)](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/the-hidden-cost-of-over-instrumentation-why-more-tracking-can-hurt-product-teams/?utm_source=tldrdata)

The pitfalls of over-instrumentation are where excessive tracking of user actions leads to metric sprawl, wasting engineering effort, and complicating data validation. Instead, teams should treat instrumentation as a product by defining clear purposes for tracked metrics, creating documentation for key events, conducting quarterly cleanup of unused events, and involving analysts early in the design phase to ensure actionable data.

[### Data Integrity vs Data Security: Why You Need Both (3 minute read)](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-data-integrity-vs-data-security/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Data integrity ensures data remains accurate, consistent, and trustworthy throughout its lifecycle, while data security focuses on protecting data from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks. Data integrity employs techniques like referential integrity checks, data validation, and observability tools to prevent corruption or errors, whereas data security uses encryption, access controls, and threat detection to safeguard data.

[### Schema In, Data Out: A Smarter Way to Mock (4 minute read)](https://hackernoon.com/schema-in-data-out-a-smarter-way-to-mock?utm_source=tldrdata)

MockingJar is an open-source tool designed to generate realistic, schema-valid mock data instantly‚Äîcrucial for speeding prototyping, testing, and data flow validation across software stacks. It features a visual schema builder, robust validation, and an AI-powered generator (Claude Sonnet 4). MockingJar supports complex structures, embedded schemas, and custom constraints. It is usable as both a web app and a TypeScript package.

[### Introducing Northguard and Xinfra: Scalable Log Storage at LinkedIn (12 minute read)](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/infrastructure/introducing-northguard-and-xinfra/?utm_source=tldrdata)

LinkedIn replaced its sprawling Kafka estate with Northguard, a sharded log store that stripes data and metadata for automatic balance, stronger consistency, and massive scale. Xinfra provides a virtual pub-sub layer so apps keep the same API during seamless, federated migrations across clusters.

[### Langfuse and ClickHouse: A New Data Stack for Modern LLM Applications (8 minute read)](https://clickhouse.com/blog/langfuse-and-clickhouse-a-new-data-stack-for-modern-llm-applications?utm_source=tldrdata)

Langfuse transitioned from a Postgres-based architecture to ClickHouse with a Redis for cache, S3 for storing large payloads, and an async event processor to manage high-ingestion workloads. It enables efficient real-time analytics and seamless migration for over 1,000 self-hosted users without downtime by leveraging ClickHouse's columnar architecture.
