### Deep Dives

[### Building Etsy Buyer Profiles with LLMs (10 minute read)](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/building-etsy-buyer-profiles-with-llms?utm_source=tldrdata)

Etsy uses large language models to create personalized buyer profiles from browsing and purchasing data, enabling tailored search experiences for its 90M buyers while complying with privacy laws. Optimizations like partitioned BigQuery tables, reduced data windows, and scaling up computational resources cut profile generation time from 21 days to 3 days for 10M users and reduced estimated costs by 94%, powering applications like query rewriting and refinement pills.

[### Data Modeling Guide for Real-Time Analytics with ClickHouse (14 minute read)](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/practical-data-modeling-clickhouse/?utm_source=tldrdata)

ClickHouse enables sub-200ms queries across billions of records by combining columnar storage, advanced compression, and vectorized execution with minimal query-time joins. Its MergeTree engine supports high-throughput streaming ingestion, incremental partitioned updates, built-in deduplication, and multi-level optimizations like materialized views and projections, minimizing ETL complexity. Limitations include complex updates, limited joins, and a lack of foreign keys. Data Modeling techniques such as pre-aggregation, TTL, sampling, and stratified data management yield 10-100x performance and storage improvements.

### Opinions & Advice

[### How to Spot (and Fix) 5 Common Performance Bottlenecks in pandas Workflows (6 minute read)](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-to-spot-and-fix-5-common-performance-bottlenecks-in-pandas-workflows/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Identify and address five common pandas performance bottlenecks: slow CSV loading can be alleviated with PyArrow or GPU acceleration via cuDF; large merges can be optimized with indexed joins and also benefit from GPU processing; and high-memory string columns may be converted to categorical types to reduce RAM usage. Utilizing GPU resources, such as in Google Colab, can significantly enhance performance without altering existing code.

[### Data Is Risky Business: The Risk of AI Atrophy (9 minute read)](https://tdan.com/data-is-risky-business-the-risk-of-ai-atrophy/32918?utm_source=tldrdata)

Widespread adoption of GenAI is shifting organizational structures, reducing traditional entry-level roles and automating foundational cognitive tasks. Research shows 71% of employees expect new hires to focus on output review, not creation. This undermines experiential learning critical for managerial progression, introduces risks of cognitive atrophy, and challenges knowledge transfer. Avoiding human ‚Äúatrophy‚Äù requires balanced investment in staff capabilities (data literacy, critical thinking, evaluation, and judgment) across three stages: before the prompt, after the answer, and at the point of action.

[### The Pedantic Layer (3 minute read)](https://joereis.substack.com/p/the-pedantic-layer?utm_source=tldrdata)

The data industry is fixated on definitions and semantics, which often hinders practical advancements. Data leaders need to focus on the value and outcomes derived from data, rather than getting bogged down in debates about categorization, especially as AI blurs the lines between structured and unstructured data. Data professionals must prioritize extracting meaningful insights and improving decision-making over pedantic discussions.

[### PostgreSQL 18 RC1 Released (5 minute read)](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-18-rc-1-released-3130/?utm_source=tldrdata)

PostgreSQL 18 delivers major improvements in performance, developer features, and security, including a new asynchronous I/O subsystem that speeds scan-heavy workloads, skip-scan support for b-tree indexes, virtual generated columns as the default, built-in UUIDv7 support, and richer EXPLAIN diagnostics. Security is also strengthened with OAuth authentication, MD5 password deprecation, TLS and cipher suite updates, and default data checksums. Upgrade tools have been enhanced with preserved planner statistics and faster pg\_upgrade options. General availability is scheduled for September 25.

[### Streamline Structured + Unstructured Data Flows from Postgres with AI (6 minute read)](https://hackernoon.com/streamline-structured-unstructured-data-flows-from-postgres-with-ai?utm_source=tldrdata)

CocoIndex lets you build incremental data flows across both structured and unstructured sources by treating AI operations, such as embedding generation, as standard pipeline transforms alongside classic data calculations and mappings. Direct PostgreSQL integration allows ingestion, transformation (including AI-powered semantic enrichment), and export to vector-indexed tables optimized for semantic + structured search. The framework provides field lineage visualization and live pipeline monitoring.

### Miscellaneous

[### Data Engineering Acquisitions (3 minute read)](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/data-engineering-acquisitions/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Companies are acquiring specialized tools to build comprehensive platforms, reducing fragmentation and improving integration for data engineers. Acquisitions like Tabular reflect a push toward open-source table formats, enabling better data interoperability across platforms.

[### GPUs Never Signed Up for This AI Security Job (4 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/gpus-never-signed-up-for-this-ai-security-job/?utm_source=tldrdata)

GPUs, originally designed for trusted, single-user environments, lack fundamental multitenancy safeguards and runtime observability critical for secure AI workloads in modern shared infrastructure. Unlike CPUs, GPUs have no built-in process isolation, memory segmentation, or granular telemetry. Their large, privileged drivers amplify the attack surface. As organizations deploy sensitive AI workloads on shared GPU clusters, assuming CPU-style security creates acute vulnerabilities and blind spots that current infrastructure is ill-equipped to monitor or mitigate.
