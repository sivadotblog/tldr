[### An LLM-Based Workflow for Automated Tabular Data Validation (6 minute read)](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-llm-based-workflow-for-automated-tabular-data-validation/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Automating data cleaning for tabular datasets can be streamlined using a structured framework focused on data validity based on expected formats, types, and distributions. The process involves detecting and correcting errors by defining data expectations through semantic and statistical analysis, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify issues and suggest corrections. Effective data validation hinges on iterative rule-based checks, employing libraries like Pandera and Great Expectations, with a human-in-the-loop approach enhancing transparency and reliability. An implementation of the presented method is available.

[### Reducing Runtime Errors in Spark: Why We Migrated from DataFrame to Dataset (8 minute read)](https://medium.com/agoda-engineering/reducing-runtime-errors-in-spark-why-we-migrated-from-dataframe-to-dataset-5b8fc5ac7297?utm_source=tldrdata)

Migrating from DataFrame to Dataset in Apache Spark significantly reduces runtime errors by leveraging Scala's type safety to catch issues at compile time. DataFrames, being untyped, often lead to errors like column mismatches or null values that only surface during execution, disrupting pipelines. Datasets, with their strongly typed structure, ensure errors are caught early, improving debugging and reliability in complex data workflows. This shift enabled Agoda's team to streamline development, boost pipeline stability, and accelerate the delivery of data-driven features.

[### Tinder's migration to Elasticsearch 8 (10 minute read)](https://medium.com/tinder/tinders-migration-to-elasticsearch-8-1999748ed7f4?utm_source=tldrdata)

Tinder's ES6 to ES8 migration included three stages. Stage 1 involved achieving data consistency through dual writes to both ES6 and ES8 clusters. Stage 2 covered data reindexing into ES8, rigorous validation checks, performance benchmarking, and testing of critical functionalities like search relevance and recommendations. Stage 3 focused on deploying shadow traffic for real-time evaluation, gradually shifting live traffic while monitoring key metrics, and completing the cutover plus decommissioning the old cluster.

### Opinions & Advice

[### Fully Local Data Transformation with dbt and DuckDB (7 minute read)](https://duckdb.org/2025/04/04/dbt-duckdb?utm_source=tldrdata)

Engineers can now perform local data transformations using DuckDB and dbt with the dbt-duckdb adapter. A persisted DuckDB database, combined with external GeoJSON files, handles 400 MB of data in 40-45 seconds on a MacBook Pro, and the adapter's external materialization feature supports exporting to CSV, JSON, and Parquet files with a full refresh capability. DuckDB also integrates smoothly with a local PostgreSQL instance, enabling seamless querying of PostgreSQL data alongside DuckDB's efficient in-memory processing.

[### What ‚ÄúShifting Left‚Äù Means and Why it Matters for Data Stacks (22 minute read)](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/shifting-left/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Shifting left in data engineering involves moving data quality checks, business logic, and governance processes earlier in the data lifecycle‚Äîcloser to the data source. This strategy aims to detect and resolve data issues promptly, reducing downstream errors and fostering more maintainable data systems. By adopting declarative tools like SQLMesh, organizations can centralize logic, streamline development workflows, and ensure consistent metric definitions across the data stack. This approach not only enhances data quality and system performance but also aligns data practices more closely with software engineering principles, promoting efficiency and scalability.

[### Ecosystem Considerations for Data Science (14 minute read)](https://thedataecosystem.substack.com/p/issue-42-ecosystem-considerations-for-ml-ai?utm_source=tldrdata)

Organizations often rush to adopt AI, seeing it as a quick fix for business challenges, without integrating it into a comprehensive data ecosystem framework. Successful ML/AI implementations hinge not on standalone technology, but on a holistic data strategy encompassing quality data, robust infrastructure, algorithms, and human expertise. Key considerations include aligning AI projects with business strategy, ensuring data readiness, and fostering cross-departmental collaboration. Focusing on the full data ecosystem rather than isolated AI ventures reduces failure rates and enhances business impact. Businesses must prioritize broad ecosystem foundations alongside AI development for transformative success.
