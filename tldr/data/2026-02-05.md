### Deep Dives

[### Lessons learned from scaling data scientists with AI (7 minute read)](https://medium.com/whatnot-engineering/lessons-learned-from-scaling-data-scientists-with-ai-e7aa7b3235b4?utm_source=tldrdata)

Whatnot scaled its data science team by heavily leaning on LLMs and AI tools. It built custom internal tooling around strong prompting patterns, creating reusable prompt libraries, implementing strong human-in-the-loop review processes, and treating LLM outputs as strong first drafts rather than final answers, allowing a small team to support high business velocity.

[### How Yelp Built a Back-Testing Engine for Safer, Smarter Ad Budget Allocation (10 minute read)](https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2026/02/how-yelp-built-a-back-testing-engine-for-safer-smarter-ad-budget-allocation.html?utm_source=tldrdata)

Yelp built a Back-Testing Engine to safely simulate proposed changes to its complex Ad Budget Allocation system by replaying historical campaign data through production-like logic, using tools like CatBoost ML models for outcome prediction, Scikit-Optimize for parameter tuning, and Git-submodule-integrated code to evaluate system-wide impacts without risking live advertisers.

[### How ShareChat Scaled their ML Feature Store 1000X without Scaling the Database (7 minute read)](https://hackernoon.com/how-sharechat-scaled-their-ml-feature-store-1000x-without-scaling-the-database?utm_source=tldrdata)

ShareChat engineers overhauled their ML feature store with the aim of serving 1 billion features/second on ScyllaDB. The original design failed at 1 million/sec, primarily due to inefficient data modeling and tiling. Key optimizations included serializing features with protocol buffers, refining tile aggregation intervals, adopting leveled compaction, and ultimately splitting into smaller services to increase cache hit rates (to 95%). Integrating Envoy Proxy further boosted cache hits to 98% and enabled further scaling without expanding the database cluster.

### Opinions & Advice

[### Dashboards vs. Agents: Navigating the New Era of BI and Analytics with Mike Driscoll (54 minute podcast)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIQGgS4Zus&amp;utm_source=tldrdata)

AI is reshaping analytics by reviving semantic layers for meaning, speed, and trust, while dashboards remain essential for core monitoring even as ad hoc reporting declines. The real shift is closing the loop from insight to action, which makes strong data engineering standards and deep domain expertise more important, not less.

[### Three ways AI will change engineering practices (4 minute read)](https://www.infoworld.com/article/4123664/three-ways-ai-will-change-engineering-practices.html?utm_source=tldrdata)

AI integration is streamlining engineering workflows by accelerating prototype development, improving architecture validation, and enhancing productivity through automated research and documentation. Teams are now required to strengthen documentation practices to maximize AI effectiveness and context accuracy, while heightened compliance and data governance are critical due to expanding privacy regulations.

[### The Gravity of Open Standards: PostgreSQL as the Ultimate Anti-Lock-In Strategy (6 minute read)](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/the-gravity-of-open-standards-postgresql-as-the-ultimate-anti-lock-in-strategy/?utm_source=tldrdata)

PostgreSQL embodies the "gravity of open standards" as the ultimate anti-lock-in strategy, thanks to its vendor-neutral community governance, strict adherence to SQL standards, open-source licensing that prevents proprietary capture, long-term backward compatibility, and design prioritizing data portability and migration freedom. This approach creates strong ecosystem "gravity" through trust, broad tooling, stable extensions, and real-world adoption.

[### Enterprises Don't Have an AI Problem. They Have an Architecture Problem (4 minute read)](https://hackernoon.com/enterprises-dont-have-an-ai-problem-they-have-an-architecture-problem?utm_source=tldrdata)

Many organizations mistake deploying chatbots, RAG systems, or workflow automation for true enterprise AI, but these are isolated tools, not an enterprise capability layer. Effective enterprise AI demands architected integration with clear business outcomes, robust governance, consistent data ownership, and alignment with frameworks like TOGAF. Without architectural discipline, organizations accumulate technical debt, risking fragile, unscalable systems instead of realizing AI's transformational potential.

### Launches & Tools

[### The $5 Million Bots Bill (Sponsor)](https://hydrolix.io/solutions/bot-insights/?utm_source=Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=TLDR)

Most web traffic is driven by bots, and it's crushing companies' budgets. (One client found Hydrolix after bot traffic bypassed their firewall, hit origin servers, and triggered >$5million overcharges.) Hydrolix accurately classifies human and bot traffic in real time, identifying good bots, AI scrapers, impersonators, emerging threats, etc - then mitigates them instantly. See how it works.

[### sqldef (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/sqldef/sqldef?utm_source=tldrdata)

sqldef is a single-binary, idempotent schema management tool that lets you define your entire database schema in plain SQL and safely apply changes by diffing desired vs current state. It supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server, works online or offline, generates deterministic DDL, and fits cleanly into CI/CD without custom DSLs or migration files.

[### bunqueue (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/egeominotti/bunqueue?utm_source=tldrdata)

bunqueue is a Bun-first job queue built on SQLite (WAL) that aims for very low latency and simple ops: no Redis, no external services, and a BullMQ-compatible API. It supports embedded (in-process) or TCP server mode, and includes production features like retries/backoff, stall detection, DLQs, rate limiting, cron, metrics, and S3 backups.

[### OpenTelemetry Collector vs agent: How to choose the right telemetry approach (3 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2026/02/02/opentelemetry-collector-vs-agent-how-to-choose-the-right-telemetry-approach/?utm_source=tldrdata)

OpenTelemetry's rapid adoption is redefining observability for cloud-native architectures, with its Collector serving as a central hub for aggregating, transforming, and exporting telemetry, and its agent acting as a lightweight sidecar for local data capture. Centralized control and scalability depend on the Collector, while low-overhead, source-proximate telemetry favors the agent.

[### How Grab Built a Vision LLM to Scan Images (10 minute read)](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/how-grab-built-a-vision-llm-to-scan?utm_source=tldrdata)

Grab built a custom 1B-parameter Vision LLM from scratch to improve customer ID verification by accurately extracting information from diverse, real-world document images in Southeast Asia, overcoming the shortcomings of general-purpose vision models through a specialized four-stage training pipeline (projector alignment, vision enhancement, language-specific training, and task-focused fine-tuning) using synthetic/real data generated by an auto-labelling framework.

[### How AI Agents Helped Migrate a Data Lake From Snowflake to BigQuery (4 minute read)](https://hackernoon.com/how-ai-agents-helped-migrate-a-data-lake-from-snowflake-to-bigquery?utm_source=tldrdata)

Migrating a data lake between data platforms requires comprehensive pipeline refactoring and translation of complex, layered SQL logic. Leveraging generative AI agents and centralizing refactoring guidelines and workflow in a structured AGENTS.md enables efficient rewriting and validation of hundreds of scripts and database objects where traditional NLP and other string-matching methods fail.
