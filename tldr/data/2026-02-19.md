[### Drastically Reducing Out-of-Memory Errors in Apache Spark at Pinterest (12 minute read)](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/drastically-reducing-out-of-memory-errors-in-apache-spark-at-pinterest-c55d7dac2257?utm_source=tldrdata)

Pinterest developed the Auto Memory Retries feature, which automatically retries OOM-failed tasks first by increasing CPU allocation to reduce contention, then launching bigger executors with 2x/3x/4x resource profiles scaling memory, overhead, and off-heap for Gluten jobs. This resulted in a 96% reduction in OOM failures, compute cost savings, and reduced manual tuning efforts on common culprits like severe data skew or unpredictable per-task memory spikes.

[### Scaling LLM Post-Training at Netflix (11 minute read)](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-llm-post-training-at-netflix-0046f8790194?utm_source=tldrdata)

Netflix developed an internal Post-Training Framework to scale LLM post-training, abstracting away infrastructure complexities with optimized data pipelines (on-the-fly sequence packing + document masking for skewed distributions), advanced parallelism (FSDP, tensor parallelism), and orchestration workflows using Ray and Verl, while integrating PyTorch, vLLM, and Hugging Face for flexibility and custom architectures.

[### Agoda's API Agent Converts Any API to MCP with Zero Code and Deployments (3 minute read)](https://medium.com/agoda-engineering/how-to-convert-any-api-to-mcp-with-zero-code-and-zero-deployments-using-apiagent-fa494de8eaee?utm_source=tldrdata)

Agoda's API Agent enables zero-code, zero-deployment transformation of any internal REST or GraphQL API into an MCP endpoint, streamlining AI-driven queries across heterogeneous systems. With automated schema introspection, in-process DuckDB for context-limited summarization, and robust support for security and observability, teams can rapidly connect and query multiple APIs from a single MCP server by merely updating configurations.

[### Data-to-Production: Bridging the Gap Between Iceberg and Live Microservices (7 minute read)](https://www.wix.engineering/post/data-to-production-bridging-the-gap-between-iceberg-and-live-microservices?utm_source=tldrdata)

Wix Engineering built a self-service Data-to-Production platform to bridge the gap between their petabyte-scale Apache Iceberg data warehouse on S3 and live microservices, ingesting billions of rows into ClickHouse via dynamic, reliable Airflow-orchestrated pipelines (with strategies like atomic overwrites, upserts using ReplacingMergeTree, and partition replacements) while enforcing governance through a metadata console and human-in-the-loop reviews.

### Opinions & Advice

[### Why Data Lineage Matters (8 minute read)](https://www.starburst.io/blog/why-data-lineage-matters/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Data lineage gives teams a clear, end-to-end map of how data flows and transforms across systems, turning debugging, impact analysis, and governance from guesswork into something fast and reliable. Built-in, automated lineage dramatically reduces troubleshooting time, lowers risk from schema changes, and is essential for trustworthy analytics and AI at scale.

[### Data is the New Oil, and Your Database is the Only Way to Extract It (40 minute podcast)](https://stackoverflow.blog/2026/02/17/data-is-the-new-oil/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Microsoft's database portfolio evolved from on-premises with SQL Server, global-scale NoSQL via Cosmos DB, to open-source support through managed PostgreSQL. Key challenges include implementing strong cost governance to control cloud spending, navigating multi-cloud environments for flexibility and risk mitigation, effective data management practices for reliability and performance, and the growing role of databases in enabling AI-driven insights.

[### Semantic Linking: the Aboutness of Data (8 minute read)](https://commonsensedata.substack.com/p/semantic-linking-the-aboutness-of?utm_source=tldrdata)

Separation of the Data Plane (raw data objects) and Knowledge Plane (semantic concepts and relationships) is essential for scalable, maintainable, and AI-ready data architectures. Semantic linking (explicit, metadata-level mapping between data and meaning) enables efficient reuse, unified definitions, and robust semantic integration, overcoming the limitations of embedded, object-level labels. Maintaining distinct but connected planes streamlines governance and prevents semantic silos as data environments scale.

### Launches & Tools

[### Shaper (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/taleshape-com/shaper?utm_source=tldrdata)

Shaper is an open-source, self-hosted BI tool that lets you build and share dashboards entirely in SQL, powered by DuckDB. It supports embedded analytics, automated reports, multiple export formats, and a git-based, SQL-first workflow designed for developers and data teams.

[### pg-typesafe (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/n-e/pg-typesafe?utm_source=tldrdata)

pg-typesafe is a zero-runtime tool that generates fully type-safe TypeScript types for constant PostgreSQL queries, giving you strongly typed parameters and results without changing how you write queries.

[### Orchestrating Polars Cloud Queries with Apache Airflow (8 minute read)](https://pola.rs/posts/airflow-orchestration/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Polars Cloud now enables data teams to remotely orchestrate Polars queries via Apache Airflow, streamlining infrastructure and allowing dynamic compute scaling using a unified API.

### Miscellaneous

[### Policy Engines Don't Work for AI Authorization. Here's Why (5 minute read)](https://authzed.com/blog/policy-engines-dont-work-for-ai-authorization-heres-why?utm_source=tldrdata)

AI agent authorization increasingly demands relationship-based access control (ReBAC) instead of traditional policy engines, as access decisions depend on dynamic, real-time relationships between users, agents, and data. While policy engines like AWS Cedar excel in static, stateless scenarios, they struggle to scale with shifting context and complex relationship graphs, resulting in unwieldy schemas and gaps in access control. Systems such as SpiceDB and Google Zanzibar natively represent and compute on relationships, allowing seamless, granular, and scalable permissions as entities and contexts change.

[### Why cloud outages are becoming normal (4 minute read)](https://www.infoworld.com/article/4132902/why-cloud-outages-are-becoming-normal.html?utm_source=tldrdata)

A 10-hour Azure outage in February 2024, triggered by a misconfigured storage policy, disrupted VM operations and managed identities across multiple regions, halting CI/CD pipelines and crippling developer productivity. Root causes include increased platform complexity, inadequate operational staffing due to cost-cutting, and insufficient architectural resilience from enterprises.

Google's MapTrace automatically generates and validates millions of annotated map images to train multimodal models for spatial path tracing, using Gemini and Imagen-4 to ensure pixel-level accuracy.

[### The 2026 RAG Performance Paradox: Why Simpler Chunking Strategies Are Outperforming Complex AI-Driven Methods (9 minute read)](https://ragaboutit.com/the-2026-rag-performance-paradox-why-simpler-chunking-strategies-are-outperforming-complex-ai-driven-methods/?utm_source=tldrdata)

FloTorch's 2026 benchmark shows that simple recursive character splitting at 512 tokens outperformed complex semantic and proposition-based chunking for RAG pipelines, delivering the highest accuracy and 3-5x lower vector counts and infrastructure costs.
