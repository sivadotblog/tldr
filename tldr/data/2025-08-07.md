[### Practical Skyline Queries in Go (25 minute read)](https://dev.to/gkoos/practical-skyline-queries-in-go-1mb9?utm_source=tldrdata)

Skyline queries identify Pareto-optimal points in multi-dimensional datasets (those not dominated on all criteria by any other point). They are highly efficient for best/worst point filtering. A new Go library implements skyline with three algorithms, Block Nested Loop (BNL), Divide & Conquer, and Skytree, balancing simplicity and scalability. Accompanied by a CLI tool, users can load CSV data, specify dimensions and preferences (min or max), choose an algorithm, and output marked skyline points.

[### Automating Knowledge Graph Creation with Gemini and ApertureDB ‚Äì Part 2 (4 minute read)](https://mlops.community/automating-knowledge-graph-creation-with-gemini-and-aperturedb-part-2/?utm_source=tldrdata)

This post presents a stepwise workflow that combines Gemini 2.5's advanced entity and relationship extraction with ApertureDB's multimodal data management to automate knowledge graph generation and interactive visualization. The resulting graphs can support downstream applications like RAG pipelines, semantic search, and multimodal analytics. The complete project code is available in linked Collab notebooks and GitHub repository.

[### A Gentle Introduction to DSPy for Graph Data Enrichment (10 minute read)](https://blog.kuzudb.com/post/graph-data-enrichment-using-dspy/?utm_source=tldrdata)

How can you enrich and unify graph data from multiple sources? This approach uses a two-step pipeline: vector search for candidate matches and DSPy for LLM-based entity disambiguation. The author also introduces DSPy's declarative primitives to build robust, prompt-free AI workflows and demonstrates how to generate a rich, queryable Nobel mentorship knowledge graph.

[### Milvus: Building a Large-scale Vector DB for LINE VOOM's Real-time Recommendation System (12 minute read)](https://techblog.lycorp.co.jp/en/large-scale-vector-db-for-real-time-recommendation-in-line-voom?utm_source=tldrdata)

LY Corporation chose Milvus for LINE VOOM's real-time recommendation system because it is a dedicated, open-source vector database deployable on-premises with high queries per second (2406 req/s), low latency (1ms), support for storage/compute separation, and multiple index types. Through switching from offline batch to real-time recommendations, it reported a 12% increase in posts recommended within seven days and a 39-fold increase in same-day post exposures.

[### 7 Drop-In Replacements to Instantly Speed Up Your Python Data Science Workflows (8 minute read)](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/7-drop-in-replacements-to-instantly-speed-up-your-python-data-science-workflows/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Swap in GPU-accelerated versions of common Python data science libraries like pandas, Polars, scikit-learn, XGBoost, UMAP, HDBSCAN, and NetworkX to drastically reduce runtime with almost no code changes. Tools like cuDF, cuML, and cuGraph enable fast, scalable workflows using the same familiar APIs.

[### Leaning into AI, ML, and Observability to Manage Your Ever-growing Infrastructure (6 minute read)](https://www.elastic.co/blog/future-observability-genai-opentelemetry-otel-storage?utm_source=tldrdata)

Modern infrastructure's growing complexity demands advanced observability tools, leveraging cost-effective storage, OpenTelemetry for standardized data collection, signal correlation, and AI/ML to manage data volume, reduce noise, and accelerate root cause analysis.

[### Getting The Most From The LangChain Ecosystem (5 minute read)](https://www.kdnuggets.com/getting-the-most-from-the-langchain-ecosystem?utm_source=tldrdata)

The LangChain ecosystem enables rapid development of complex AI systems, with LangServe facilitating deployment through REST APIs with streaming and monitoring capabilities. LangSmith supports debugging, testing, and monitoring with tracing and alerts, while LangGraph and LangGraph Studio enable the creation, visualization, and management of stateful, multi-actor AI workflows.

[### Btree\_gist Improvements in PostgreSQL 18 (6 minute read)](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/btree_gist-improvements-in-postgresql-18/?utm_source=tldrdata)

The btree\_gist extension in PostgreSQL 18 introduces sortsupport, significantly improving index creation times and query performance compared to PostgreSQL 17.5 by enabling sorted input for GiST indexes, resulting in faster index builds and up to three times higher transaction throughput for queries using exclusion constraints and nearest-neighbor searches.

[### Getting Started with WarpStream on Tigris (4 minute read)](https://www.warpstream.com/blog/getting-started-with-warpstream-on-tigris?utm_source=tldrdata)

WarpStream's Kafka-compatible service writes directly to object storage, eliminating disks, AZ egress costs, and broker sprawl. This tutorial shows how to deploy on Tigris for ‚Äúbottomless‚Äù queues with RPO = 0, making global streaming pipelines simpler and cheaper.

[### Postgres Replication Slots: Confirmed Flush LSN vs. Restart LSN (12 minute read)](https://www.morling.dev/blog/postgres-replication-slots-confirmed-flush-lsn-vs-restart-lsn/?utm_source=tldrdata)

In PostgreSQL, replication slots track consumer progress with two key attributes to prevent premature log pruning: confirmed\_flush\_lsn (marks the latest acknowledged log for resuming streaming) and restart\_lsn (retains the oldest WAL needed for in-flight or unacknowledged transactions). This distinction is critical for managing WAL retention, handling concurrent transactions, and ensuring safe recovery after downtime.

[### 2025 AI Governance Survey ‚Äì Pacific AI & Gradient Flow (12 minute read)](https://pacific.ai/2025-ai-governance-survey/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Pacific AI's 2025 survey of AI leaders reveals a growing mismatch between ambition and preparedness: while 75% of organizations have AI usage policies, only 59% have dedicated governance roles, and 54% maintain incident response playbooks. Just 30% of respondents have deployed generative AI to production, and only 13% run multiple systems. Key barriers include speed-to-market pressure, low monitoring of model drift or misuse, governance gaps in smaller firms, and limited regulatory awareness. Generally, company size correlates with AI adoption maturity.

[### Memory in Agents: Make LLMs Remember (6 minute read)](https://www.philschmid.de/memory-in-agents?utm_source=tldrdata)

Agent memory is key to overcoming LLMs' inherent statelessness: by engineering both short-term (working memory) and long-term (persistent memory) into systems, agents can recall past interactions, personalize responses, and reason over multi-step tasks reliably. Short-term memory handles current session context (system prompts, tool states, and recent messages) while long-term memory uses vector-enabled stores to retrieve facts, episodic events, and internal rules when needed. Memory may be updated explicitly during interactions or implicitly by background processes, trading immediacy for reduced latency. Designing effective memory systems requires managing relevance, evicting stale content, and preventing bloat to maintain accuracy and efficiency over time.

[### How LLMs See the World (11 minute read)](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/how-llms-see-the-world?utm_source=tldrdata)

Tokenization, the process of breaking text into units like words or subwords, is critical for Large Language Models (LLMs), converting text into numerical vectors for processing, impacting API costs, context limits, and performance in areas like non-English text, math, and code generation. Issues like inefficient tokenization of non-English languages, fragmented numbers (e.g., "3.11" vs. "3.9"), and code syntax challenges explain many LLM limitations.
