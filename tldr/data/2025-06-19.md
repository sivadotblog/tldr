### Deep Dives

[### The Complete Stream Processing Journey on FlinkSQL (8 minute read)](https://engineering.grab.com/the-complete-stream-processing-journey-on-flinksql?utm_source=tldrdata)

Grab replaced its fragmented, per-user Zeppelin notebook setup with a centralized FlinkSQL gateway to democratize real-time stream processing and eliminate cold-start delays. The three-layer architecture comprises a shared compute cluster for query execution, an integration layer with out-of-the-box Kafka and feature-store connectors, and a query portal that auto-builds and deploys pipelines in under ten minutes. This approach streamlines development, empowering analysts and developers to build and scale real-time applications with minimal overhead.

[### Exploring and Interpreting Malaria Genomic Data with Streamlit (45 minute video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwvKnoLiYCk&amp;utm_source=tldrdata)

Built at the Sanger Institute, the PF Haplo Atlas turns tens of terabytes of raw malaria-parasite genomic data into an interactive Streamlit + Plotly dashboard that lets data teams track variant prevalence, drug-resistance mutations, and geographic/temporal trends at a glance. By distilling complex bioinformatics pipelines into a clean, self-serve web app, it empowers engineers, scientists, and public health stakeholders to explore, download, and share insights without writing code.

[### How LINE MANGA used ClickHouse to Enable Real-time Analysis Without Moving a Single Row (7 minute read)](https://clickhouse.com/blog/line-manga?utm_source=tldrdata)

LINE MANGA enhanced its real-time analytics by integrating ClickHouse with its sharded MySQL databases, allowing direct querying without data migration. This approach enabled fast, SQL-based joins across product and user data, real-time analytics on reader behavior, recommendations, and revenue tracking.

### Opinions & Advice

[### I Won $10,000 in a Machine Learning Competition ‚Äî Here's My Complete Strategy (9 minute read)](https://towardsdatascience.com/i-won-10000-in-a-machine-learning-competition-heres-my-complete-strategy/?utm_source=tldrdata)

A recent $10,000-winning Machine Learning competition strategy highlights advanced feature selection with permutation and SHAP importance, threshold tuning using cross-validated ROC-AUC optimization, and ensemble stacking of deep neural networks with XGBoost. Success in the field is generally not about the tools used but about the practitioner's ability to understand the problem, apply solid fundamentals, and focus on the objective.

[### The Hype is Over: Generative AI is Driving the Evolution of Search Within Enterprises (5 minute read)](https://www.elastic.co/blog/evolution-search-enterprises?utm_source=tldrdata)

Enterprise search has evolved from simple keyword-based queries to AI-powered, context-aware systems that deliver precise, personalized results. Deploying a vector database and creating data embeddings is the first step for RAG and LLM workflows, but the real challenge is optimizing search relevance to retrieve the most contextually valuable information.

[### This AI Agent Should Have Been a SQL Query (6 minute read)](https://www.morling.dev/blog/this-ai-agent-should-have-been-sql-query/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Flink SQL and FLIP-437 empower data engineers to build event-driven AI agents. Structured data is added to LLM prompts using SQL joins from source connectors or lookup joins from external databases and CRM systems, while unstructured, non-public data is included via RAG with natively supported vectors to include relevant, domain-specific context at inference time.

[### Power BI Best Practices from the Field: Lessons from Enterprise Deployments (9 minute read)](https://www.eckerson.com/articles/power-bi-best-practices-from-the-field-lessons-from-enterprise-deployments?utm_source=tldrdata)

Scaling Power BI across the enterprise demands structured governance, streamlined semantic models, and centralized ‚Äúgolden datasets‚Äù to eliminate dataset sprawl and performance bottlenecks. Critical practices include holistic environment assessments, workspace redesign, upstream data prep, and continuous usage monitoring. These strategies translate to improved trust, accelerated self-service, and sustainable, governed growth in Power BI deployments.

### Launches & Tools

[### Universal Data Orchestrator in Action: Enterprise Best Practices (10 minute read)](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/enterprise-universal-data-orchestrator-in-action/?utm_source=tldrdata)

Kestra delivers a dual-code-and-UI data orchestration platform supporting modular, enterprise-ready pipelines by integrating tools like dlt and Snowflake, robust plugin architecture, and advanced features such as tenant isolation and API-first secret management. The platform streamlines workflow creation with integrated YAML versioning, seamless Git sync, and supports AI-powered development through Model Context Protocols (MCPs), enabling collaborative pipeline management.

[### DuckLake & The Future of Open Table Formats ft. Jordan Tigani & Hannes M√ºhleisen (60 minute video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn07s-_PgrI&amp;utm_source=tldrdata)

DuckLake puts metadata in any SQL database and data as Parquet files in blob storage which means ditching catalogs, Avro/JSON layers, and Spark yet still offering ACID transactions, real-time updates, and unlimited snapshots. You can spin up a full-featured lakehouse in three CLI commands, use Postgres, BigQuery, Snowflake (etc.) as your catalog, and get millisecond query planning at petabyte scale, slashing both cost and complexity.

[### A Practical Guide to Multimodal Data Analytics (8 minute read)](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2025/06/google/a-practical-guide-to-multimodal-data-analytics?utm_source=tldrdata)

BigQuery's ObjectRef feature unifies structured and unstructured data, enabling multimodal analytics through SQL and Python by linking data like images or audio in Google Cloud Storage to database tables. This allows seamless querying of diverse data types, such as combining e-commerce ticket data with customer call recordings or product images.

[### Preserve Optimizer Statistics During Major Upgrades with PostgreSQL v18 (3 minute read)](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/preserve-optimizer-statistics-during-major-upgrades-with-postgresql-v18/?utm_source=tldrdata)

PostgreSQL v18 introduces a feature to preserve optimizer statistics, eliminating the need for a full database ANALYZE post-upgrade with pg\_upgrade or dump/restore. This reduces downtime and maintains query performance by retaining statistics in catalog tables.

[### ‚ÄúLocalhost tracking‚Äù Explained. It Could Cost Meta 32 Billion (6 minute read)](https://www.zeropartydata.es/p/localhost-tracking-explained-it-could?utm_source=tldrdata)

Meta secretly bridged its Facebook/Instagram apps and mobile browsers via WebRTC ‚Äúlocalhost‚Äù ports and Pixel scripts to link incognito or VPN-protected web visits with real user accounts, bypassing Android's sandbox and cookie restrictions. Regulators may impose cumulative fines under GDPR, the Digital Services Act, and the Digital Markets Act, totaling up to 4% + 6% + 10% of Meta's > ‚Ç¨164 billion revenue (‚âà‚Ç¨32 billion). This unprecedented privacy breach underscores the urgent need for stronger consent enforcement and technical safeguards in mobile tracking.

[### Search Engine Retrieval (4 minute read)](https://buttondown.com/jaffray/archive/search-engine-retrieval/?utm_source=tldrdata)

A search engine fundamentally performs two distinct tasks: retrieval (locating all documents matching a query) and ranking (ordering results by relevance). Retrieval is essentially a set intersection using an inverted index. Efficient retrieval relies on constructing sorted posting lists mapping terms to document IDs. Understanding that retrieval is a set intersection guides implementation decisions for search infrastructure.
