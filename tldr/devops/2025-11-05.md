## AWS DynamoDB Outage ☁️, Grafana Mimir 🆕, AI Platform At Pinterest 🧷

[### 🧱 Build-it-yourself platforms work great, until they don't. (Sponsor)](https://octopus.com/use-case/platform-hub?utm_source=tldr-devops&amp;utm_medium=paid-display&amp;utm_campaign=global-102025-platform-hub&amp;utm_content=use-case&amp;utm_term=)

Every platform story starts the same way: a few scripts, shared templates, maybe a shiny UI. It feels fast, flexible, and totally under control.

Then the team grows. Environments multiply. Suddenly you're spending more time maintaining what you built than improving how software gets delivered.

[Platform Hub from Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/use-case/platform-hub?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_medium=paid-display&utm_campaign=global-102025-platform-hub&utm_content=use-case&utm_term=) helps you escape that dead end. It scales what teams already do well—automating pipelines, enforcing policies, and standardizing delivery without killing speed.

Stop patching your homegrown platform. Start focusing on delivery.

[### Grafana Mimir 3.0 release: performance improvements, a new query engine, and more (7 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/11/03/grafana-mimir-3-0-release-all-the-latest-updates/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana Mimir 3.0 has been released, featuring a decoupled architecture using Apache Kafka to improve reliability, performance, and cost efficiency. The new architecture separates read and write paths, allowing each to scale independently, and also includes the Mimir Query Engine, which reduces peak memory usage by up to 92%. It is recommended that users reference the upgrade guide and release notes before upgrading to the new version.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### Don't give Postgres too much memory (4 minute read)](https://vondra.me/posts/dont-give-postgres-too-much-memory/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Benchmarking PostgreSQL's GIN index builds shows that raising maintenance\_work\_mem from 64 MB to 16 GB slowed performance by ~30%, even on a fully cached, CPU-bound system. The slowdown stems mainly from exceeding L3 cache capacity—forcing expensive main-memory access—and from kernel write stalls when large dirty buffers accumulate. Thus, smaller memory settings often yield faster, steadier performance.

[### AWS DynamoDB Outage Analysis (22 minute read)](https://entropicthoughts.com/aws-dynamodb-outage-stpa?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Applying STPA to the DynamoDB DNS-management outage shows that although the root causes seem obvious in hindsight, a pre-incident analysis would have exposed the same issues—missing feedback between Planner and Enactors, timing gaps, the risk of deleting active plans, and failure to recover when no plan is active. The analysis demonstrates that STPA can uncover both known and latent failure modes efficiently, suggesting its regular use could have prevented the outage and should be part of standard reliability practice.

A strong design review process helps teams catch flaws early, align on goals, and move projects forward efficiently. Key practices include writing clear, broadly understandable introductions, using collaborative tools for inline comments, creating editable diagrams, letting reviewers read asynchronously, starting with one focused reviewer, resolving feedback directly in the document, limiting unresolved threads, holding meetings only for contentious issues, and running postmortems to improve future reviews.

A message broker can be built using only two UNIX signals—SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2—to transmit bits between processes in Ruby. By trapping signals, shifting bits, and using null-terminated messages, this experiment recreates a basic producer–broker–consumer system, demonstrating how simple IPC and binary operations can emulate message queuing.

[### A Decade of AI Platform at Pinterest (18 minute read)](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/a-decade-of-ai-platform-at-pinterest-4e3b37c0f758?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Pinterest's decade-long AI evolution turned fragmented ML stacks into a unified platform through shared layers like UFR, MLEnv, and the Dataset Store, with adoption accelerating once incentives and leadership aligned. Today, modeling and infrastructure are fused—GPU efficiency, Ray pipelines, and hybrid CPU/GPU serving drive both speed and capability, showing that success depends on timing when to unify versus explore.
