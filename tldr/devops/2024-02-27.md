[### Using InfluxDB for Observability (Sponsor)](https://www.influxdata.com/resources/influxdb-for-observability/?utm_source=vendor&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=2024-tldr_global&amp;utm_content=observability-tp)

[Time series data](https://www.influxdata.com/resources/influxdb-for-observability/?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_campaign=20240227) is key to observability. It‚Äôs critical to track how processes and systems change over time, especially in distributed systems.

The same data collected for observability purposes can also be used for prediction and forecasting. [Combining historical and real-time observability data](https://www.influxdata.com/resources/influxdb-for-observability/?utm_source=vendor&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=2024-tldr_global&utm_content=observability-tp) enables users to build and maintain better systems.

This [technical paper by InfluxData](https://www.influxdata.com/resources/influxdb-for-observability/?utm_source=vendor&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=2024-tldr_global&utm_content=observability-tp) covers the role of a time series database in observability, and shows how you can achieve better outcomes by moving your observability data into InfluxDB.
