[### Better Shell History Search (10 minute read)](https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2025/better_shell_history_search.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Pairing Ctrl-r with fuzzy finders like fzf or skim significantly improves shell productivity by enabling fast, flexible history searches with multi-match previews and fuzzy matching. Customizing the display to show relative timestamps (e.g., “1d” or “08:15”) instead of raw history numbers makes it easier to identify and reuse past commands efficiently.
