You've been there: code's ready to ship, everyone's excited—then someone spots a vulnerability. Suddenly it's an all-hands emergency and time to cancel your evening plans.

[Microsoft Azure](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/tEDOQJ) bakes security in from the start. [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/tEDOQJ) helps keep your apps and code protected throughout the development lifecycle. Less last-minute surprises, more peace of mind.

Ship fast. Ship safely. Do both at the same time.

[### Lots of AI SRE, no AI incident management (5 minute read)](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2026/02/14/lots-of-ai-sre-no-ai-incident-management/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Emerging AI SRE tools from vendors like PagerDuty, Datadog, Microsoft, and startups focus on diagnosis and mitigation but overlook incident management and coordination. Effective incident response requires multiple perspectives to avoid fixation and actively maintain shared understanding, a challenge that current single-agent systems do not address.

CNCF CTO Chris Aniszczyk predicted that AI-powered systems will become top contributors by volume to many open source projects by the end of 2026, though he warned this will increase the review burden on maintainers without guaranteeing higher quality contributions. The interview also covered CNCF's growth to over 230 projects and 300,000 contributors across 190+ countries in its first decade, with Aniszczyk noting the convergence of observability and security and the extension of FinOps practices to AI workloads.
