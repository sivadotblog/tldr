[### How Google Does It: Building the largest known Kubernetes cluster, with 130,000 nodes (6 minute read)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/how-we-built-a-130000-node-gke-cluster/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Google Cloud proved GKE can scale to an experimental 130,000-node cluster, sustaining 1,000 Pods/sec and over 1M objects. New control-plane optimizations, advanced scheduling with Kueue, and improved storage and data access enable massive, dynamic AI workloads at extreme scale.

[### How to monitor Amazon Bedrock AgentCore AI agent infrastructure in Grafana Cloud (7 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/11/28/how-to-monitor-amazon-bedrock-agentcore-ai-agent-infrastructure-in-grafana-cloud/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana Cloud users can now monitor AWS Bedrock AgentCore agents by configuring CloudWatch metric streams. The new integration leverages OpenTelemetry, Amazon CloudWatch, and Grafana Cloud to provide end-to-end visibility into AI agent performance, including dashboards that track latency, token usage, and tool execution. Users also gain immediate access to pre-built dashboards and alerts tailored to AWS metrics through the Cloud Provider Observability application.

[### Datacenters in space are a terrible, horrible, no good idea (9 minute read)](https://taranis.ie/datacenters-in-space-are-a-terrible-horrible-no-good-idea/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Datacenters in space are wildly impractical because they can't be powered, cooled, or protected from radiation anywhere close to what modern GPUs require, making them orders of magnitude less efficient than Earth-based datacenters. Even with massive solar arrays, complex radiators, and radiation-hardened designs, you'd get only a tiny fraction of normal compute capacity at enormous cost, so the idea simply doesn't make sense.
