[### The AI code paradox: Are you stuck? (Sponsor)](https://www.sonarsource.com/sem/vibe-then-verify/?utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=ss-vibethenverify25&amp;utm_content=newsletter-devops-primary-placement-20251001-x&amp;utm_term=ww-psp-x&amp;s_category=Paid&amp;s_source=Paid%20Other&amp;s_origin=tldr)

AI writes code in seconds. But who verifies it? Manually reviewing all AI-generated code is where the bottleneck is.

Don't let new technical debt and security risks slip past. [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/get-started/cloud/?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=ss-vibethenverify25&utm_content=newsletter-devops-primary-placement-20251001-x&utm_term=ww-psp-x&s_category=Paid&s_source=Paid%20Other&s_origin=tldr) solves this engineering paradox, automatically reviewing all of your code so your team can:

* Embrace AI with confidence: Use AI coding assistants with automatic scans for quality.
* Prevent tech debt: Automatically detect and fix issues before they're merged.
* Maintain quality at scale: Ensure every line of code meets your standards, every time.
