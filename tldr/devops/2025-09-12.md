[### Cisco-Splunk strategy shift unveiled with Data Fabric (4 minute read)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/news/366630300/Cisco-Splunk-strategy-shift-unveiled-with-Data-Fabric?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cisco's Data Fabric architecture reworks Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud to emphasize federated analytics that bring insights to distributed data sources instead of relying on centralized ingestion. The strategy integrates tools like AppDynamics, Isovalent, and ThousandEyes, expands support for external sources such as Snowflake, and aims to unify observability, security, and AI capabilities for enterprise-scale operations.

[### Announcing Gateway API Support for DigitalOcean Kubernetes (2 minute read)](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/introducing-managed-gateway-api?utm_source=tldrdevops)

DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) clusters now have the Kubernetes Gateway API pre-installed at no extra cost. The new API is a managed service and is more powerful than Ingress. It uses Cilium's eBPF implementation for better performance and advanced routing. By processing traffic in the Linux kernel, it reduces latency, increases throughput, and lowers CPU usage.

[### Atlassian's move to cloud-only means customers face integration issues and more (5 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/09/atlassian_will_go_cloudonly_customers/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Atlassian is discontinuing its datacenter products, including Jira, Confluence, and Bamboo, with sales ending in 2026 and all licenses expiring in 2029, pushing customers toward Atlassian Cloud. While Bitbucket retains a hybrid license due to code sensitivity, most organizations face higher costs when migrating, despite Atlassian promoting potential savings.

[### Implementing Karpenter In EKS (From Start To Finish) (10 minute read)](https://www.cloudnativedeepdive.com/implementing-karpenter-in-eks-from-start-to-finish?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Karpenter can be implemented in EKS by creating the cluster with Terraform, configuring IAM roles and OIDC for service accounts, and deploying the Karpenter controller with Helm. Once installed, NodePool and EC2NodeClass manifests define scaling behaviors and instance settings, enabling dynamic and efficient cluster scaling.

[### Terraformer: Reverse Engineering Infrastructure as Code (8 minute read)](https://blog.stackademic.com/terraformer-reverse-engineering-infrastructure-as-code-a4542ab44ba9?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Terraformer is an open-source CLI tool from Google that reverse-engineers existing infrastructure into Terraform code, generating both HCL configurations and state files for easier management. It supports multi-cloud environments and helps with migration, auditing, onboarding, and disaster recovery. Terraformer requires careful handling of dependencies, state, and security in the generated code.

[### Rust compiler performance survey 2025 results (13 minute read)](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/09/10/rust-compiler-performance-survey-2025-results/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The first Rust Compiler Performance Survey gathered over 3,700 responses, showing mixed satisfaction: while some developers find Rust builds faster than C++, many struggle with long incremental rebuilds, type checking delays, and slow CI builds. The Rust team is addressing these issues through improvements like switching to faster linkers, reducing debug info by default, and creating a build performance guide, while also pursuing long-term efforts such as incremental linking and parallel compilation.
