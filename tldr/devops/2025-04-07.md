[### Pitfalls of Safe Rust (14 minute read)](https://corrode.dev/blog/pitfalls-of-safe-rust/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Rust's memory safety guarantees do not prevent many common bugs like integer overflows, logic errors, and race conditions, especially when using safe code. To build truly robust systems, developers must adopt defensive coding techniques‚Äîlike bounded types, safe conversions, constant-time comparisons, and careful serialization‚Äîwhile also leveraging tools like Clippy and cargo-geiger to catch unsafe patterns early.

[### The Insanity of Being a Software Engineer (3 minute read)](https://0x1.pt/2025/04/06/the-insanity-of-being-a-software-engineer/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Being a software engineer often means endlessly learning new frameworks, tools, and responsibilities as the industry shifts. From mastering front-end tech like React and TypeScript to wrangling infrastructure with Docker, Terraform, and AWS, the role has expanded far beyond coding, blurring into DevOps, infrastructure, and even management. There are ever-increasing expectations and little room for specialization, despite the rising complexity of software systems.
