### Opinions & Tutorials

[### Logging sucks (12 minute read)](https://loggingsucks.com/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Traditional logs are noisy, low-context, and optimized for writing, not for answering real debugging questions in distributed systems. The fix is wide events (canonical log lines): emit one high-cardinality, high-dimensional, context-rich event per request (with tail sampling). This turns debugging from grep-based archaeology into fast, analytical queries.

Exploring Kyverno through the LFX mentorship enabled significant open source contributions, including optimizing the CLI to reduce policy application time on 3,000+ resources from 15 minutes to 1–2 seconds using concurrent loading, namespace caching, and deferred RestMapper discovery.
