[### Kubernetes v1.33: Image Pull Policy the way you always thought it worked! (5 minute read)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/12/kubernetes-v1-33-ensure-secret-pulled-images-alpha/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes v1.33 has begun to address a 10-year-old security issue (issue 18787) where pods with the `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent` setting could access private images already pulled by other pods on the same node without proper authentication. With the KubeletEnsureSecretPulledImages feature gate enabled, Kubernetes now verifies pod credentials before allowing access to locally present images, enhancing security without re-authenticating pods using the same credentials.

[### Incident Report: Spotify Outage on April 16, 2025 (2 minute read)](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2025/5/incident-report-spotify-outage-on-april-16-2025?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A global Spotify outage was triggered by a low-risk change to Envoy filter order on April 16, which exposed a bug causing all Envoy instances to crash. This led to a traffic surge that overwhelmed Kubernetes memory limits, causing repeated instance shutdowns. The issue was mitigated by increasing server capacity and has since prompted fixes to configuration, rollout processes, and monitoring.

[### How We Run Terraform At Scale (11 minute read)](https://benchling.engineering/how-we-run-terraform-at-scale-da7bb75dc394?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Benchling manages over 165,000 cloud resources across 625 Terraform workspaces using a highly automated system built on Terraform Cloud, saving thousands of developer hours and eliminating infrastructure drift. By moving from manual, error-prone processes to scalable automation and custom tooling, Benchling has improved release efficiency and developer experience at scale.

[### A Critical Look at MCP (9 minute read)](https://raz.sh/blog/2025-05-02_a_critical_look_at_mcp?utm_source=tldrdevops)

MCP aims to standardize LLM-to-tool communication but suffers from poor documentation, confusing design, and inconsistent transport protocols. Its use of "Streamable HTTP" over standard WebSockets adds unnecessary complexity and security risks, making adoption difficult and error-prone.

[### IaC Ownership - Tag-based approach (9 minute read)](https://www.token.security/blog/iac-ownership---tag-based-approach?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Determining ownership of non-human identities, especially those created via Infrastructure as Code, is crucial but complex, as traditional logging often only reveals the automated system and not the responsible human. Token Security explored a tagging-based method using Terraform plan files to trace identity creation back to specific code contributors, but found it too cumbersome for scale, highlighting the broader challenge of assigning clear human ownership in fast-moving IaC environments.

[### Prometheus: How We Slashed Memory Usage (8 minute read)](https://devoriales.com/post/384/prometheus-how-we-slashed-memory-usage?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Prometheus can silently consume massive memory in Kubernetes environments due to high-cardinality metrics and label combinations, especially when metrics are duplicated across jobs or use dynamic labels like path and replicaset. The culprits can be identified and eliminated using promtool and PromQL, then scraping can be optimized and rules relabeled to safely reduce memory usage without breaking dashboards or alerts.

[### Deep dive into the challenges of building Kafka on top of S3 (14 minute read)](https://blog.det.life/deep-dive-into-the-challenges-of-building-kafka-on-top-of-s3-37a5c5eb9c0b?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kafka's architecture, designed for local data centers, faces cloud challenges like coupled compute/storage and high cross-AZ transfer fees, prompting alternatives that store data in object storage like S3 for cost efficiency. AutoMQ, an open-source Kafka-compatible solution, addresses these challenges by rewriting Kafka's storage layer to use object storage effectively while maintaining low latency through a Write Ahead Log (WAL) and managing data locality for efficient caching.
