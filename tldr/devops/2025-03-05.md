Unite Dev and Sec with ASPM!

Integrating security early in the software development lifecycle is a familiar concept. But how do you cut through the noise and give developers the security insights they actually need?

Introducing: [Application Security Posture Management (ASPM)](https://www.wiz.io/lp/redefining-secure-development-dev-sec-aspm?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_medium=paid-email&utm_campaign=FY26Q1_INB_FORM_Redefinining-Secure-Development&sfcid=701Py00000K8n4sIAB&utm_term=FY26Q1-tldr-devops-nl&utm_content=DevSecASPM).

In [this guide](https://www.wiz.io/lp/redefining-secure-development-dev-sec-aspm?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_medium=paid-email&utm_campaign=FY26Q1_INB_FORM_Redefinining-Secure-Development&sfcid=701Py00000K8n4sIAB&utm_term=FY26Q1-tldr-devops-nl&utm_content=DevSecASPM), we'll explore the:✅ ASPM approach and how it removes silos✅ The limitations of the “Shift Left” approach✅ The evolving developer and application security landscape

Plus, see how Wiz Code equips teams with the right tools to ship fast and fix fast.
