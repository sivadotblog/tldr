[### Beyond IP lists- a registry format for bots and agents (6 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/agent-registry/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

To help website operators identify and verify bots and agents, Cloudflare is proposing a registry of bots and agents that would expand Web Bot Auth with a list of URLs where agent keys can be retrieved. The registry format would foster an open ecosystem of curators that website operators can trust.

[### BGP zombies and excessive path hunting (10 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/going-bgp-zombie-hunting/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare is hunting "BGP zombies," which are outdated routes stuck in the Internet's Default-Free Zone (DFZ) due to issues like buggy software or slow route processing, potentially disrupting Internet traffic. When a more-specific BGP prefix is withdrawn, routers exhaustively search for the best path, called "path hunting", which can lead to the creation of these zombies. To lessen the likelihood of these zombies, Cloudflare will introduce improvements for BGP traffic forwarding internally and encourage customers to use a multi-step draining process for on-demand prefixes.

[### Prometheus native histograms in Grafana Cloud: Get more precision from your Grafana visualizations (6 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/10/30/get-more-precision-from-your-grafana-visualizations-with-prometheus-native-histograms-in-grafana-cloud/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Prometheus native histograms are now generally available in Grafana Cloud, offering higher resolution and precision compared to classic Prometheus histograms. Grafana Cloud customers found that native histograms solved the issue of traditional histograms with predefined bucket boundaries by dynamically adjusting buckets and efficiently capturing distributions, with pricing structured at one active bucket multiplied by 0.25. The update directly integrates with Grafana Metrics Drilldown, automatically identifying native histogram metric types and generating corresponding queries and visualizations without needing PromQL.

[### 4 reasons to upgrade your secret scanner (6 minute read)](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/4-reasons-to-upgrade-your-secret-scanner?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Open source secret scanners are useful for basic detection but struggle with complex environments, limited coverage, and manual remediation. Commercial solutions like Vault Radar provide continuous, context-aware monitoring, automated remediation, enterprise-scale visibility, and compliance support.

[### Moving tables across PostgreSQL instances (5 minute read)](https://ananthakumaran.in/2025/11/02/moving-tables-across-postgres-instances.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

To migrate specific PostgreSQL tables between instances, native logical replication can be used instead of Google's Database Migration Service, which only supports full-database transfers. The process involves granting replication access, copying schemas without constraints, setting up publication and subscription, rebuilding indexes and foreign keys, syncing sequences, and using PgBouncer for near-zero downtime during switchover.

Centralized logging for AWS CloudFormation StackSets allows organizations to monitor multi-account deployments from a single management account, reducing operational overhead and improving troubleshooting efficiency. The solution uses EventBridge to forward events from member accounts to a central CloudWatch Log Group, enabling consolidated monitoring, custom queries, and dashboards across regions and accounts.
