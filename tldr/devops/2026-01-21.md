### News & Trends

[### Being a platform engineer in 2026: Career reality check (5 minute read)](https://platformengineering.org/blog/being-a-platform-engineer-in-2026?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Platform engineering transitioned into an industrial standard by 2025, enabling mature organizations to achieve 20:1 developer-to-platform-engineer ratios and halve time-to-market. Average salaries, now at $160,000 in North America and $104,000 in Europe, reflect the role's democratization rather than devaluation. AI literacy has become a survival-level competency for practitioners.

[### GitLab Announces General Availability of GitLab Duo Agent Platform (4 minute read)](https://www.devopsdigest.com/gitlab-announces-general-availability-of-gitlab-duo-agent-platform?utm_source=tldrdevops)

GitLab Duo Agent Platform is now in general availability. The platform enables orchestrated AI agents across the full software lifecycle to address delivery bottlenecks beyond coding. It offers agentic chat, prebuilt and custom agents, governance controls, and usage-based pricing via GitLab Credits.

[### What AI is actually good for, according to developers (5 minute read)](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/what-ai-is-actually-good-for-according-to-developers/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This post discusses AI coding tools designed to protect developer flow with contextual, customizable help rather than chat-centered automation, prioritizing human judgment, learning, minimal interruptions, and refinement driven by feedback that removes tedium without disrupting creativity.

[### Unconventional PostgreSQL Optimizations (13 minute read)](https://hakibenita.com/postgresql-unconventional-optimizations?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Unconventional PostgreSQL techniques such as constraint\_exclusion, function-based indexes on lower-cardinality expressions, virtual generated columns, and hash-backed exclusion constraints can significantly reduce query execution time, index size, and unnecessary full-table scans. These approaches outperform standard full-table scans and B-tree indexing in analytics-heavy and ad-hoc query workloads by better aligning indexes and constraints with actual query needs.

### Miscellaneous

[### Making Very Small LLMs Smarter With RAG (7 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/making-small-llms-smarter/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Small, local LLMs can be effectively leveraged for niche development tasks by implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach allows LLMs to generate accurate code snippets for the custom Nova Golang library, addressing limitations faced by larger commercial models unaware of such specialized projects.

[### Self-Driving DevOps? How Stakpak Tackles Infrastructure Complexity (5 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/self-driving-devops-how-stakpak-tackles-infrastructure-complexity/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Stakpak introduced an open-source DevOps agent aimed at making infrastructure more autonomous by securing secrets, preventing destructive actions with guardrails, and centralizing shared operational knowledge so AI can handle complex, non-coding DevOps tasks reliably.

[### IP Addresses through 2025 (45 minute read)](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2026-01/addr2025.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

IPv4 is effectively “post-exhaustion” by 2025: the globally allocated public pool is flat to slightly shrinking (~3.687B allocated at end-2025, down ~237k on the year), remaining free space sits mostly in APNIC/AFRINIC, and scarcity is managed via NAT/CGNAT plus an active—but cooling—transfer market whose prices fell sharply through 2025. IPv6 keeps growing in deployment, but 2025 saw fewer and much smaller allocations (big drop in total /32s allocated), and the Internet's trajectory is still shaped by the client/server + NAT model rather than a return to universal, publicly reachable end hosts.
