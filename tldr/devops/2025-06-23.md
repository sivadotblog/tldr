[### Smart uses of imagePullSecrets in Kubernetes Cluster with ServiceAccounts (4 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/06/20/smart-uses-of-imagepullsecrets-in-kubernetes-cluster-with-serviceaccounts/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

By attaching imagePullSecrets to service accounts, Kubernetes users can automatically populate those secrets in Pods, streamlining the process of authenticating with private registries. This approach simplifies management compared to manually adding imagePullSecrets to every YAML file, especially when dealing with numerous Kubernetes objects.

[### A Cloud Dev Hack: Connecting Local Code to Remote Clusters (8 minute read)](https://metalbear.co/blog/cloud-dev-hack/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Mirrord by MetalBear allows developers to connect local code to a remote Kubernetes pod, enabling them to code, debug, and test with access to real cluster resources without full cloud deployment. The tool intercepts system calls and reroutes them through the cluster, giving local apps access to internal APIs, queues, and secrets as if they were running inside the cluster. It can be installed as a standalone CLI tool, through the VS Code extension, or through the IntelliJ plugin.
