[### Why Kubernetes needs an LTS (5 minute read)](https://matduggan.com/why-kubernetes-needs-an-lts/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Containers have become a staple for modern teams, with Kubernetes being the standard orchestration platform despite its frequent releases and upgrade challenges. Kubernetes follows an N-2 support policy with a 15-week release cycle, resulting in a 14-month support period. Adopting a long-term support (LTS) model with a 24-month support period would allow organizations more time for planned upgrades and simplify the process, benefiting both operators and the broader Kubernetes ecosystem.
