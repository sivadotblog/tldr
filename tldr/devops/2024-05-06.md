[### 👋 Goodbye, controlled data access. Hello, collaborative data access (Sponsor)](https://www.tonic.ai/start-here?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=20240506&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_term=devops)

Controlled data access is no longer fit for purpose. Businesses can't accept a situation where a few super users hold the keys to the castle, and everyone else gets partial and inaccurate data due to rudimentary masking and anonymization.

[Collaborative data access](https://www.tonic.ai/start-here?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_campaign=20240506) is the new approach that ensures data is useful, realistic, safe, and API-accessible. In this approach, [synthetic data is used to mimc your real data](https://www.tonic.ai/start-here?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_campaign=20240506) — creating an accurate de-identified representation for effective testing and development.

Big players like eBay are [already using similar approaches](https://www.tonic.ai/start-here?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_campaign=20240506) to generate realistic, safe data across distributed teams and environments in the petabytes.
