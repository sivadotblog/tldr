[### Superhuman observability with AI agents (Sponsor)](http://newrelic.com/event/new-relic-advance-amer?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=tldr-newsletter)

What if your observability platform didn't just detect issues, but resolved them automatically?

At [New Relic Advance](http://newrelic.com/event/new-relic-advance-amer?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=&utm_content=tldr-newsletter) — a free virtual event on February 24 — the team will show how agentic AI plugs into observability workflows to detect, diagnose, and resolve incidents without waiting for a human. They're also demoing[full-stack visibility for AI applications](http://newrelic.com/event/new-relic-advance-amer?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=&utm_content=tldr-newsletter) and tools that tie system performance directly to business metrics.

If you're running production systems and want to see where observability is heading, this is worth a calendar block.

[### Amazon EC2 supports nested virtualization on virtual Amazon EC2 instances (1 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2026/02/amazon-ec2-nested-virtualization-on-virtual/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Amazon EC2 has introduced the ability to create nested environments within virtualized instances, a capability previously limited to bare metal EC2. Available on C8i, M8i, and R8i instances across all commercial regions, this allows customers to run KVM or Hyper-V for use cases such as mobile application emulators and Windows Subsystem for Linux.

[### Introducing the Terraform State Provider for Pulumi ESC (2 minute read)](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/esc-terraform-state-provider/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The new `terraform-state` provider for Pulumi ESC is designed to directly read outputs from Terraform state files and integrate them as first-class values within ESC environments. This eliminates manual copy-pasting and scripts, automatically treating sensitive Terraform outputs as secrets and supporting remote backends like Terraform Cloud.

[### Using go fix to modernize Go code (14 minute read)](https://go.dev/blog/gofix?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Go 1.26 introduces a completely rewritten `go fix` subcommand that automatically modernizes Go code by applying fixes that leverage newer language features, such as the enhanced `new` function, to improve clarity and ensure LLMs are trained on current idioms. This advancement builds upon the Go analysis framework and foreshadows a future "self-service" paradigm for user-defined modernizations.

[### Enhance Kubernetes high availability with Amazon Application Recovery Controller and Karpenter integration (8 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/enhance-kubernetes-high-availability-with-amazon-application-recovery-controller-and-karpenter-integration/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AWS built an open source Kubernetes controller to integrate Karpenter with Amazon Application Recovery Controller zonal shift, automatically reconfiguring node pools to avoid impaired Availability Zones during failures. The solution improves EKS resiliency, aligns autoscaling with traffic shifts, and can be tested using AWS Fault Injection Service.

[### Bias Toward Action (9 minute read)](https://addyosmani.com/blog/bias-towards-action/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Bias toward action means taking the smallest responsible step that generates real user feedback—while building guardrails (feature flags, monitoring, rollbacks, and error budgets) that make being wrong safe and quickly reversible. Fast teams aren't reckless - they invest in infrastructure that makes frequent, low-risk deployments boring, so they can learn quickly without compromising reliability.

Google Distributed Cloud air gapped 1.15 adds preview features, including Cloud NAT, enhanced standard cluster connectivity, and HTTP and HTTPS load balancer health checks, plus general availability of subnet groups for simpler IP management. These updates improve outbound control, cross-environment communication, reliability, and scalable subnet allocation in secure environments.

[### The only developer productivity metrics that matter (2 minute read)](https://genehack.blog/2026/02/the-only-developer-productivity-metrics-that-matter/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Most software productivity metrics are meaningless because teams can game them. The only two metrics that actually matter are how routinely a team ships new versions and how rarely those releases cause serious production breakages. If a team ships at least weekly and production almost never goes down, then the next metric to optimize is whether each release genuinely makes users happier.
