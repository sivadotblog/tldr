### News & Trends

[### FedRAMP Compliance with Hardened Images (6 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/fedramp-compliance-with-hardened-images/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Docker has announced FIPS 140-compliant and STIG-hardened images for Docker Hardened Images (DHI) in order to help companies reduce the costs and time associated with achieving Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) compliance. The new images are pre-configured to use FIPS-validated software and tested to confirm correct function, and STIG-hardened images are scanned using OpenSCAP and a custom container STIG, with results delivered as signed attestations. Docker Hardened Images are designed to help companies meet the expansive security controls described in NIST Special Publication 800-53 and ship software more confidently.

[### OpenAI open weight models now available on AWS (5 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/openai-open-weight-models-now-available-on-aws/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker JumpStart now offer access to OpenAI's open-source models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, designed for text generation, coding, scientific analysis, and mathematical reasoning. Both models feature a 128K context window and adjustable reasoning levels and are available in Amazon Bedrock in the US West (Oregon) AWS Region. Amazon SageMaker JumpStart supports these models in US East (Ohio and N. Virginia) and Asia Pacific (Mumbai and Tokyo). Users can access these models via an OpenAI-compatible endpoint or the Bedrock InvokeModel and Converse API, as well as evaluate and customize them in SageMaker Studio.

[### Announcing Rust 1.89.0 (5 minute read)](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/08/07/Rust-1.89.0/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Rust 1.89.0 introduces key language improvements, including support for \_ in const generic arguments, a new mismatched\_lifetime\_syntaxes lint for clearer lifetime usage, additional x86 target features, cross-compiled doctests, and relaxed rules for using i128/u128 in C FFI. The release also begins demoting x86\_64-apple-darwin to Tier 2, adds new Tier 3 targets, stabilizes numerous APIs (like File::lock and Result::flatten), and makes several APIs usable in const contexts.

[### Ansible Dynamic Inventory: Types, How to Use & Examples (23 minute read)](https://spacelift.io/blog/ansible-dynamic-inventory?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Managing infrastructure across multiple cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud can make static Ansible inventories difficult to maintain. Ansible dynamic inventory automatically pulls host data from sources like cloud providers, keeping the inventory updated in real time.

[### Disposable Code Is Here to Stay, but Durable Code Is What Runs the World (8 minute read)](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/disposable-code-is-here-to-stay?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Software is increasingly split between disposable code‚Äîfast, low-cost, short-lived scripts and prototypes‚Äîand durable code‚Äîlong-lived, high-stakes systems that require reliability, maintainability, and trust. AI can accelerate both, but while disposable code will become a common skill for many, durable code will remain a specialized profession, as the systems that run the world still demand careful testing, observability, and progressive rollout.

AWS Fault Injection Service now supports network-level chaos experiments for Amazon ECS Fargate, enabling simulation of latency, packet loss, and blackhole scenarios to test application resilience. Using a sample three-tier Fargate application with an RDS dependency, AWS demonstrates how these experiments expose latency impacts while confirming operational stability and effective recovery mechanisms under stress.

[### AI Agents Need Help. Here's 4 Ways To Ship Software Reliably (5 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-need-help-heres-4-ways-to-ship-software-reliably/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

As large language models generate more code, the delivery pipeline becomes the critical bottleneck, requiring software-delivery automation to ensure reliability. Four key principles for trustworthy AI agent workflows include scoping agents to small tasks, using repeatable sandboxes, maintaining full observability, and continuously running evaluations to measure performance and prompt quality.

[### Diff Risk Score: AI-driven risk-aware software development (5 minute read)](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/08/06/developer-tools/diff-risk-score-drs-ai-risk-aware-software-development-meta/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Meta's AI-powered Diff Risk Score (DRS), built on a fine-tuned Llama LLM, predicts the likelihood of code changes causing production incidents and has enabled the company to eliminate major code freezes. During a major partner event in 2024, DRS allowed Meta to land over 10,000 previously frozen code changes with minimal production impact, leading to significant productivity gains.
