[### 64.4% of product roadmaps already include agentic AI. Developers aren't sure what it actually is (Sponsor)](https://www.nylas.com/agentic-ai-report-2026/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredemail&amp;utm_campaign=FY26Q1-TLDR-AgenticAI-feb-16&amp;utm_content=)

The discussion around agentic AI is no longer "if" but "how" - as teams grapple with decisions around [autonomy, oversight, and scope](https://www.nylas.com/agentic-ai-report-2026/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=sponsoredemail&utm_campaign=FY26Q1-TLDR-AgenticAI-feb-16&utm_content=).

Nylas asked 1,000+ devs and product leaders why agentic AI is so roadmap-friendly, and the [results](https://www.nylas.com/agentic-ai-report-2026/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=sponsoredemail&utm_campaign=FY26Q1-TLDR-AgenticAI-feb-16&utm_content=) are surprising:

* 85% say agentic AI will be table stakes within three years.
* 67% of teams are already building or shipping agentic workflows - although there's wildly different definitions of "agentic" between teams.
* 40.8% are directly implementing AI systems today.

‼️ Virtually all respondents said agentic AI influences vendor switching decisions.
