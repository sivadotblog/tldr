Engineering teams ship containers, spin up serverless functions, and provision databases by the dozen. Meanwhile, security teams face three compounding problems: more identities to manage, more access requests to process, and an explosion of resources to track.

[Legacy security tools can't keep up.](https://www.strongdm.com/signup?trk=strongdm-newsletter-trial&utm_source=strongdm&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=2026-q3-tldr-newsletter&utm_content=trial) The result? Entitlement creep, visibility gaps - and when audit season arrives, you're building spreadsheets trying to figure out who has access to what, when, and why.

StrongDM provides a [single identity-aware access layer](https://www.strongdm.com/signup?trk=strongdm-newsletter-trial&utm_source=strongdm&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=2026-q3-tldr-newsletter&utm_content=trial) across databases, servers, cloud consoles, and internal applications. Instead of bolting on another tool, StrongDM sits above the infrastructure to give Security, IAM, and DevOps teams unified control.

[### A framework for measuring Internet resilience (17 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-framework-for-measuring-internet-resilience/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This post introduces a data-driven framework to quantify Internet resilience that focuses on a network's ability to withstand disruptions and recover rapidly from failures like the 2022 Rogers outage that impacted over 12 million users in Canada. The framework uses public data to measure factors like diverse routing paths, secure routing, and market competitiveness, emphasizing the importance of interconnectedness among Autonomous Systems (ASes) for a stable and reliable Internet. Key metrics include the number and distribution of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), peering participation rates, diversity of IXP membership, and the geographic distribution of infrastructure, along with assessing network hygiene through practices like RPKI and BCP-38.
