[### There is no Vibe Engineering (4 minute read)](https://serce.me/posts/2025-31-03-there-is-no-vibe-engineering?utm_source=tldrdevops)

"Vibe coding," popularized by Andrej Karpathy, involves generating code via AI agents without directly interacting with the codebase. It lacks the long-term thinking and system design required in real software engineering. While AI-generated code may aid rapid prototyping, building scalable, secure, and maintainable systems still demands traditional engineering practices‚Äîso there is no real "vibe engineering," just engineering.
