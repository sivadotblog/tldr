This reconsideration of microservices is part of a broader trend of reevaluating cloud computing and operational efficiencies in the face of rising costs.

[### Styra's Policy as Code Report: Identity and Access Management Drives Adoption (2 minute read)](https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/12/styra-policy-as-code-report/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A report based on a survey of 285 U.S. developers and technical decision-makers revealed that 97% of respondents consider policy as code essential for efficient software development in cloud environments. Custom-built authorization systems, favored by 95% of respondents, were also acknowledged to have significant deficiencies in efficiency, security, and application performance by about two-thirds of them. The report highlighted diverse applications of policy as code in both application and infrastructure contexts and identified key motivators for its adoption.

[### The Case for Containers on Lambda (3 minute read)](https://aaronstuyvenberg.com/posts/containers-on-lambda?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AWS Lambda has significantly improved the cold start performance of container images by up to 15 times, making containers a viable option for Lambda functions. Performance tests demonstrate that for Node.js functions, container images outperform zip-based Lambda functions for sizes beyond 30MB, while for Python functions, containers excel for sizes beyond 200MB. These improvements introduce compelling reasons to use containers for Lambda functions, including developer familiarity, multi-stage build advantages, cross-compilation support, and more.
