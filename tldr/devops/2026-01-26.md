[### From AI agent prototype to product: Lessons from building AWS DevOps Agent (9 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/from-ai-agent-prototype-to-product-lessons-from-building-aws-devops-agent/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This post describes lessons from building the AWS DevOps Agent, outlining five mechanisms to productionize agentic systems: evals, fast feedback loops, trajectory visualization, intentional changes, and production sampling. It details how these practices improve reliability, accuracy, and cost efficiency in incident response.

[### Scaling maintenance: Rethinking HDFS block placement for exabyte-scale clusters (9 minute read)](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/infrastructure/rethinking-hfds-block-placement-for-exabyte-scale-clusters?utm_source=tldrdevops)

To address challenges in maintaining its massive ~5 exabyte Apache Hadoop clusters, LinkedIn re-engineered its Block Placement Policy (BPP) and redistributed over 3 exabytes of existing data, successfully eliminating data replication during maintenance operations. This crucial change significantly improved maintenance velocity, allowing daily upgrades for approximately 4.5% of datanodes while unclogging the network and bolstering HDFS reliability and security.

[### Ingress Security for AI Workloads in Kubernetes: Protecting AI Endpoints with WAF (6 minute read)](https://www.tigera.io/blog/ingress-security-for-ai-workloads-in-kubernetes-protecting-ai-endpoints-with-waf/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The transition of AI workloads to production within Kubernetes has exposed critical security vulnerabilities in traditional ingress controllers, necessitating advanced Layer 7 inspection and context-aware gateways with WAF capabilities to protect expensive GPU resources from threats like LLM Jacking and prompt injection.
