[### Life Altering Postgresql Patterns (8 minute read)](https://mccue.dev/pages/3-11-25-life-altering-postgresql-patterns?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Designing a maintainable and resilient PostgreSQL schema involves adopting patterns that simplify development, prevent data loss, and support real-world application needs. These include using UUIDs for primary keys, timestamping records, enforcing strict constraints, organizing with schemas, and favoring enum tables.

[### Observing machine learning workloads on Amazon EKS (9 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/part-1-introduction-to-observing-machine-learning-workloads-on-amazon-eks/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

MLOps on Amazon EKS streamlines the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of ML models by automating resource allocation, tracking performance metrics like accuracy and latency, and addressing challenges such as model drift and data integrity. Observability enables real-time insights through monitoring GPU usage, detecting data drift, and ensuring compliance.

[### No Longer My Favorite Git Commit (9 minute read)](https://mtlynch.io/no-longer-my-favorite-git-commit/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A widely admired Git commit message, once praised for its detailed storytelling, falls short as a model of effective software engineering communication. While rich in context, it buries key information, lacks clarity about the problem, omits links to referenced code, and violates the inverted pyramid structure—prompting a revised version that emphasizes clarity, relevance, and structure without losing detail.

[### Micro-Segmentation Security In Azure Networks (6 minute read)](https://aidanfinn.com/?p=24266&amp;utm_source=tldrdevops)

Micro-segmentation is essential for modern Azure network security, as traditional firewall-based defenses are insufficient against contemporary cyber threats like ransomware and supply chain attacks. By isolating workloads with dedicated virtual networks, enforcing strict access controls, and implementing continuous monitoring, organizations can minimize attack impact, enhance security, and comply with industry best practices.

[### Deliberate Practice for Developers (4 minute read)](https://alexalejandre.com/programming/deliberate-practice-for-developers/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Deliberate practice means breaking down expert skills, focusing deeply on one at a time, and using immediate feedback to improve. Developers can apply this by avoiding distractions, drilling specific weaknesses through targeted exercises, and building lasting fluency with tools and patterns.

[### Faster interpreters in Go: Catching up with C++ (15 minute read)](https://planetscale.com/blog/faster-interpreters-in-go-catching-up-with-cpp?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The Vitess team at PlanetScale replaced their original SQL AST interpreter with a new callback-based virtual machine written in Go that matches the performance of MySQL's native C++ evaluation engine. By leveraging static type analysis, specialized instructions, and Go's closures, they achieved a fast, memory-efficient, and maintainable design—avoiding JIT complexity while pushing Go performance to near C++ levels.
