[### Ansible: pure (only in its) pragmatism (8 minute read)](https://andrejradovic.com/blog/ansible/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Ansible is a pragmatic, widely-used tool for managing system configurations due to its idempotent, agentless design, and vast ecosystem. Despite its quirks, it excels at simplifying routine tasks, though it's best seen as a lightweight helper, not a full infrastructure-as-code solution in the age of OpenTofu and Packer.

[### Backup and Restore Kubernetes Volumes with Longhorn and MinIO (7 minute read)](https://medium.com/@mughal.asim/backup-and-restore-kubernetes-volumes-with-longhorn-and-minio-4197dc1eb118?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This guide details the process of automating Longhorn backups to MinIO (S3-compatible storage) on Kubernetes and restoring data following a simulated disaster. It uses manual steps to expose the core mechanics of Longhorn/MinIO integration and then redeploys a MySQL deployment to verify the restore process.

[### Guardrails for Your Cloud: A Simple Guide to OPA and Terraform (4 minute read)](https://medium.com/@er.samibanerjee/guardrails-for-your-cloud-a-simple-guide-to-opa-and-terraform-aada0d589dc5?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is a security guard for infrastructure code that ensures policies across Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more. When paired with Terraform, OPA acts as a policy-as-code solution, allowing users to limit the scope of changes, ensure resources are tagged, prevent risky deployments, and block security misconfigurations.
