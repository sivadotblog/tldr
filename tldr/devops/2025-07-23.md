[### Enhancing GKE data protection with cross-project backup and restore (5 minute read)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/backup-for-gke-supports-cross-project-backup-and-restore/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Google Kubernetes Engine now supports cross-project backup and restore, enabling centralized management of backups across multiple Google Cloud projects with improved security and disaster recovery. This capability enhances operational workflows by allowing environment seeding, cloning, and delegated restore access while maintaining strict separation of duties for compliance.

[### Shutdown season - the Q2 2025 Internet disruption summary (16 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/q2-2025-internet-disruption-summary/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

In Q2 2025, Cloudflare observed government-directed Internet shutdowns in Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Panama, a reversal from Q1 when no shutdowns were seen. A major power outage in Spain and Portugal also disrupted connectivity. Cyberattacks targeted a Russian provider, knocking the network offline for 10 hours after reaching 70.07 Gbps.

[### The 2025 Docker State of Application Development Report (10 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/2025-docker-state-of-app-dev/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AI adoption is rising but uneven across industries, with IT leading both in usage and strategy. Meanwhile, security is now a shared responsibility, with most organizations keeping it in-house and involving developers, DevOps, and team leads. Despite better tools and cloud-native workflows, developers still face bottlenecks in time estimation, task planning, and pull-request reviews.

[### Deploying Azure Service Groups with Terraform AzAPI (7 minute read)](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/service-groups-terraform-azapi/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Microsoft Azure now offers Service Groups in limited public preview, enabling flexible, application-centric grouping of resources across subscriptions without altering existing RBAC or policy structures. Using Terraform AzAPI, users can create nested, hierarchical service groups to organize resources by teams, projects, or services for improved visibility, cost tracking, and operational management.

[### Quicksilver v2: evolution of a globally distributed key-value store (Part 1) (14 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/quicksilver-v2-evolution-of-a-globally-distributed-key-value-store-part-1/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Quicksilver v1.5 introduces a proxy-replica architecture to reduce disk usage across Cloudflare's global network by splitting key-value store roles into full-data replicas and persistent cache-based proxies, enabling up to 50% space savings while laying groundwork for future scalability. To maintain consistency and performance, the system implements multiversion concurrency control, sliding window caching, negative lookup optimizations, and a dynamic discovery mechanism.

[### Debugging the One-in-a-Million Failure: Migrating Pinterest's Search Infrastructure to Kubernetes (7 minute read)](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/debugging-the-one-in-a-million-failure-migrating-pinterests-search-infrastructure-to-kubernetes-bef9af9dabf4?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Pinterest engineers migrating their Manas search infrastructure to Kubernetes discovered that cAdvisor, a container monitoring tool, caused significant latency spikes due to its memory usage tracking. The issue was resolved by disabling cAdvisor's working set size estimation, a feature that scans the kernel's page structures and clears access bits, as the process conflicted with Manas' memory-intensive search operations. This fix unblocked the Kubernetes migration and improved platform stability for memory-bound systems at Pinterest.
