### News & Trends

[### Amazon CloudFront announces support for IPv6 origins (2 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/09/amazon-cloudfront-ipv6-origins/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Amazon CloudFront now supports IPv6 connectivity to origin servers, enabling end-to-end IPv6 content delivery that enhances performance and addresses IPv4 exhaustion concerns. Customers can configure IPv4-only, IPv6-only, or dual-stack origins across all AWS Commercial Regions, with the exception of Amazon S3 and VPC origins.

[### Kubernetes v1.34: Autoconfiguration for Node Cgroup Driver Goes GA (2 minute read)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/12/kubernetes-v1-34-cri-cgroup-driver-lookup-now-ga/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes v1.34.0 introduces the general availability of the KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI feature, which allows kubelets to automatically determine the cgroup driver from the CRI implementation. Cluster admins should upgrade containerd to v2.0 or later before upgrading the kubelet to v1.36.0, as support for older versions of containerd will be dropped in v1.36.0, and the kubelet\_cri\_losing\_support metric is available to detect outdated containerd versions.

[### Announcing Amazon EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances (5 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-amazon-ec2-m4-and-m4-pro-mac-instances/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Amazon EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances are now generally available, offering up to 20% better application build performance compared to EC2 M2 Mac instances. The new instances, built on Apple's M4 and M4 Pro chips, feature up to 48 GB of unified memory and 2 TB of local storage, and are available in US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) on macOS Sonoma 15.6 and later.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### AI Coding (3 minute read)](https://geohot.github.io//blog/jekyll/update/2025/09/12/ai-coding.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AI coding tools are best understood as compilers rather than intelligent coders, since they take prompts (like source code) and output results, with English being an imprecise and unreliable input language. Their usefulness comes from improved search, optimization, and tooling, not from replacing the human role of programming, despite hype-driven investment suggesting otherwise.

[### How we made ClickHouse log queries 99.5% faster with resource fingerprinting (3 minute read)](https://signoz.io/blog/query-performance-improvement/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Log-query scanning in ClickHouse was reduced from nearly 100% of data blocks to less than 1% by reorganizing log storage. A deterministic "resource fingerprint," generated for each log source, replaced bloom-filter skip indexes, sorting the table and packing logs contiguously. As a result, a namespace filter now reads just 0.85% of blocks, slashing I/O and latency.

[### From 19k to 4.2M events/sec: story of a SQLite query optimisation (16 minute read)](https://mnt.io/articles/from-19k-to-4-2m-events-per-sec-story-of-a-sqlite-query-optimisation/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Developers working on the Matrix Rust SDK uncovered severe performance issues in fetching chunk metadata from SQLite, where an inefficient LEFT JOIN caused unnecessary scans and query times exceeding a minute. By progressively optimizing‚Äîfirst with a CASE expression, then restructuring into just two queries with Rust-side aggregation‚Äîthey improved throughput from ~20K to 4.2M events/sec, achieving a 211√ó speedup without changing schemas or core data structures.

[### Why I Ditched Redis for Cloudflare Durable Objects in My Rate Limiter (8 minute read)](https://dev.to/horushe/why-i-ditched-redis-for-cloudflare-durable-objects-in-my-rate-limiter-jof?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Redis struggled with latency, cold starts, and geographic complexity in a serverless rate limiter, making it unreliable during viral traffic spikes. Cloudflare Durable Objects provided a stateful, edge-based solution that delivered sub-5ms latency, strong consistency, and significantly lower costs while handling thousands of concurrent global requests.

[### Trusting builds with Bazel remote execution (9 minute read)](https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/bazel-remote-execution?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Bazel's remote execution provides a trusted environment that enables safe cross-user cache sharing by ensuring actions are executed deterministically and isolated from client interference. Fully securing end-to-end builds also requires strict control of the Action Cache (AC), disabling local fallbacks, and enforcing policies like invocation rules to prevent malicious or accidental cache poisoning.
