Bash 5.3 introduces key features like a new command substitution method that runs in the current shell and enhancements such as the GLOBSORT variable and updates to builtins like read, source, and compgen. Users can compile and install the release candidate from source, but are advised to avoid using it on production machines due to potential instability.

[### Atlassian research: AI adoption is rising, but friction persists (5 minute read)](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/developer/developer-experience-report-2025?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AI adoption among developers has surged, with 99% reporting time savings and 68% saving over 10 hours weekly, particularly in non-coding tasks like documentation and feature development. However, these gains are offset by organizational inefficiencies such as poor information access and frequent context switching, while a growing empathy gap shows 63% of developers feel their leaders don't understand their pain points.

[### Async I/O on Linux and durability (6 minute read)](https://blog.canoozie.net/async-i-o-on-linux-and-durability/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Leveraging Linux's io\_uring for asynchronous I/O enables parallel, batched writes that significantly boost database performance. A dual write-ahead log (WAL) design—separating intent and completion records—preserves durability guarantees while achieving a 10x improvement in throughput over traditional synchronous methods.

Kubernetes security can move from reactive to proactive using an automated system that combines eBPF-based visibility, SIEM analysis, and logic-driven responses. By integrating tools like Tetragon, Azure Sentinel, and Logic Apps, teams can detect and respond to high-severity threats such as credential theft and container escapes within seconds, without human intervention.

[### How I Reduced PHP-FPM-Based Backend Stack Memory Utilization by Over 80% — Without Changing a Line… (3 minute read)](https://medium.com/@hatamabolghasemi/how-i-reduced-php-fpm-based-backend-stack-memory-utilization-by-over-80-without-changing-a-line-a22dd983c6ea?utm_source=tldrdevops)

After implementing a PHP-FPM exporter in a Kubernetes cluster, an engineer noticed that most apps had 99% idle processes, indicating over-provisioning due to a widely used default configuration file (www.conf). By creating a `php-fpm-advisor.sh` script and adjusting the PHP-FPM configuration to better suit the application's traffic patterns, they optimized resource allocation without sacrificing performance, especially benefiting applications with 20 or more pods.

[### Behind the Streams: Live at Netflix. Part 1 (9 minute read)](https://netflixtechblog.com/behind-the-streams-live-at-netflix-part-1-d23f917c2f40?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Netflix has been building its Live platform for three years, expanding from its first live comedy special to hundreds of live events. It leveraged its existing content delivery network, Open Connect, and cloud-based infrastructure, and prioritized automation, real-time metrics, and extensive testing to ensure a seamless live streaming experience for over 300 million global subscribers.

[### How we tracked down a Go 1.24 memory regression across hundreds of pods (9 minute read)](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/go-memory-regression/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Datadog observed a ~20% increase in memory usage after upgrading to Go 1.24, traced to a regression in the mallocgc allocator, where large pointer-heavy allocations caused more virtual memory to be committed to physical RAM, even though Go's internal metrics remained stable. Collaborating with the Go community, it pinpointed the issue, validated a fix to be included in Go 1.25, and found that Go 1.24's Swiss Tables ultimately reduced memory usage in high-traffic environments, delivering a net win.

[### AppSync: how to implement unauthenticated operations (5 minute read)](https://theburningmonk.com/2025/07/appsync-how-to-implement-unauthenticated-operations/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Unauthenticated GraphQL operations in AppSync can be implemented using API keys, Lambda authorizers with shared secrets, or AWS IAM via Cognito Identity Pools. Each method balances ease of setup, access control, cost, and performance trade-offs, with API keys being simplest, Lambda offering more control, and IAM providing scalable fine-grained access.
