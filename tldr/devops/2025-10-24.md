Slack has enhanced its EC2 infrastructure safety by splitting its single production Chef environment into multiple isolated environments (prod-1 to prod-6) based on Availability Zones. Slack also replaced scheduled Chef runs with a new Chef Summoner service that triggers runs based on signals from Chef Librarian, ensuring updates are only applied when available, and introduced a fallback cron job to maintain compliance and recover from Chef Summoner failures. Slack is building a new EC2 ecosystem called Shipyard, which is designed for service-level deployments, metric-driven rollouts, and automated rollbacks.
