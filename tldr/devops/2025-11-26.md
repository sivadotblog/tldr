→ Deliver outcomes, not just features by connecting every initiative to strategy, OKRs, and measurable outcomes.

→ Make delivery predictable with a [real-time view of bottlenecks and dependencies](https://info.planview.com/digital-product-delivery-_demo-on-demand_lad_en_reg.html?utm_medium=pedm&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=pv_lad_dp-office-of-the-cto_dga_ww_x_x_en&utm_content=deliver-the-right-software-faster_demo-on-demand), and automated reporting.

→ Prove engineering ROI by showing the revenue impact of product delivery.

→ Spot compliance and delivery risks with traceability and cross-tool.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### Why I (still) love Linux (12 minute read)](https://it-notes.dragas.net/2025/11/24/why-i-still-love-linux/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Linux provides unmatched freedom, accessibility, and longevity, even as many modern distributions drift from classic Unix principles and introduce instability in the name of progress. Despite frustrations like systemd's scope creep and corporate influence on development direction, Linux remains deeply valuable thanks to its hardware support, minimalistic distributions, and the decades of learning, growth, and reliability it has enabled.

[### "Good engineering management" is a fad (8 minute read)](https://lethain.com/good-eng-mgmt-is-a-fad/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Engineering management expectations swing with industry cycles: the 2000s rewarded organizational navigation, the 2010s rewarded hypergrowth-era people leadership, and the post-2022 era rewards hands-on execution as AI and economic conditions reshape organizations. These shifts are driven by business realities—not moral narratives—so the only durable path is developing broad foundational and long-term leadership skills while managing your career energy and priorities over a decades-long horizon.

[### Reliability lessons from the 2025 Cloudflare outage (5 minute read)](https://www.gremlin.com/blog/reliability-lessons-from-the-2025-cloudflare-outage?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare's outage on November 18 was initiated by a configuration change, which caused its Bot Management system to exceed its file size limit, triggering HTTP 5XX errors that cascaded across multiple dependent services and took major websites like X, ChatGPT, and Shopify offline. To reduce similar risks, organizations should test dependencies with fault injection, monitor health checks, identify single points of failure, and implement failover or error-handling mechanisms.

[### Demystifying Determinism in Durable Execution (8 minute read)](https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2025/11/24/demystifying-determinism-in-durable-execution?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Durable execution frameworks recover by re-running a function from the top and reusing previously recorded side-effect results, which means the control flow must be fully deterministic so that every retry makes the same decisions and passes the same arguments. Side effects themselves can be non-deterministic, but they must be idempotent or duplication-tolerant because they may be re-invoked if their results weren't durably recorded.
