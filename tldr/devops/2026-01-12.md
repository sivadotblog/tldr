[### Keeping 20,000 GPUs healthy (8 minute read)](https://modal.com/blog/gpu-health?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Modal runs a globally distributed pool of over 20,000 GPUs across major cloud providers using continuous benchmarking, standardized machine images, and layered GPU health checks. GPU failures are common at this scale. High uptime depends on automated detection, isolation, and rapid replacement rather than provider guarantees alone.

[### When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail (6 minute read)](https://dev.to/aws-builders/when-you-have-a-hammer-everything-looks-like-a-nail-5e7p?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Premature adoption of cloud, Kubernetes, serverless, or GenAI without understanding business needs leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk. Use outcome-driven architecture, implement explicit constraints, selectively choose technology, and prioritize simplicity over trends.

[### How AirFrance-KLM built a secure automation platform at global scale with Terraform, Vault, and Ansible (6 minute read)](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/how-airfrance-klm-built-secure-automation-platform-global-scale-terraform-vault-ansible?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Air France-KLM reworked its automation platform using Terraform Enterprise, Vault, and Ansible to scale multi-cloud infrastructure securely while reducing cost and complexity. The shift from compliance-by-construction to policy-based guardrails cut provisioning to minutes, minimized errors, and enabled governance at scale.

[### From Chaos to Scale: Templatizing Spark Declarative Pipelines with DLT-META (5 minute read)](https://www.databricks.com/blog/chaos-scale-templatizing-spark-declarative-pipelines-dlt-meta?utm_source=tldrdevops)

DLT-META is a metadata-driven metaprogramming framework for Spark Declarative Pipelines designed to automate pipeline creation and standardize logic. The solution enables teams to scale data pipelines efficiently by centralizing configuration and dynamically generating logic at runtime, significantly reducing custom code and maintenance.

[### The coolest feature in Python 3.14 (3 minute read)](https://savannah.dev/posts/the-coolest-feature-in-314/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Python 3.14 introduces sys.remote\_exec(), which allows code to be executed inside an already running Python process without restarting it. This capability enables tools like debugwand to attach a remote debugger to Python applications running in Docker or Kubernetes with no code changes or sidecars, relying only on runtime injection and configuration.

[### Azure Policy: Required Actions for Docker Content Trust Deprecation in Azure Container Registry (2 minute read)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuregovernanceandmanagementblog/azure-policy-required-actions-for-docker-content-trust-deprecation-in-azure-cont/4478951?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Azure Container Registry is deprecating Docker Content Trust over three years, removing the trustPolicy property from ARM APIs and affecting related Azure Policy aliases. Custom policies referencing these aliases must be updated or removed to avoid compliance issues, as new ACR resources will become non-compliant once the property is deprecated.
