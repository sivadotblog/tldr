For platform engineering teams, observability is becoming the strategic layer that makes AI explainable, auditable, and resilient.

In [The State of Observability 2025](https://www.dynatrace.com/info/ebooks/the-state-of-observability/?utm_medium=ai-newsletter&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=prospect-state-of-observability-cloud-ai-observability-global&utm_content=ai-newletter&utm_term=101525), Dynatrace surveyed 800+ IT leaders to uncover insights, such as:

* 46% expect AI-driven observability to deliver the greatest ROI for optimizing AI model configurations
* 37% expect observability to help identify data drift, forecast system load, and alert users to potential issues
* 69% of AI decisions are still verified by humans

[### Managing Kubernetes Workloads Using the App of Apps Pattern in ArgoCD-2 (5 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/10/07/managing-kubernetes-workloads-using-the-app-of-apps-pattern-in-argocd-2/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The App of Apps pattern in ArgoCD uses a parent application to manage and deploy multiple child applications, enabling modular, version-controlled, and GitOps-driven Kubernetes deployments. This approach improves visibility, reusability, and consistency across environments while allowing automated syncing and self-healing of applications like NGINX Ingress and Cert-Manager.

[### Instantly respond to changes in your data with Datadog automation rules (4 minute read)](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-automation-rules/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Datadog Datastore automation rules allow workflows to trigger instantly when data is added, updated, or deleted, ensuring all processes and integrations stay current without manual intervention. This feature keeps data consistent across apps and workflows, streamlines incident management, and enables faster, automated responses to operational changes.

[### A blueprint for zero-trust AI on Kubernetes (6 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/10/10/a-blueprint-for-zero-trust-ai-on-kubernetes/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Tigera highlighted the need to secure AI workloads on Kubernetes, pointing out that while AI security challenges aren't new, the stakes are higher due to the sensitive data and powerful APIs involved. Solutions include securing API endpoints with the Kubernetes Gateway API, using network policies enforced by CNIs like Calico or Cilium, restricting API keys using IP address restrictions or egress gateways, and implementing observability with tools like OpenTelemetry.

[### From key sprawl to scalable control: Rethinking SSH access (5 minute read)](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/from-key-sprawl-to-scalable-control-rethinking-ssh-access?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Static SSH keys create security and operational challenges at scale due to long lifetimes, sharing, and lack of auditability, while SSH certificates provide short-lived, signed access controlled by a certificate authority. HashiCorp Vault and Boundary streamline SSH certificate management by dynamically generating and injecting ephemeral credentials, enabling secure, auditable, and scalable SSH access with centralized policy and minimal user overhead.
