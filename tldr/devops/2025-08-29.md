### Opinions & Tutorials

[### How we saved $1.5 million per year with Cloud Cost Management (7 minute read)](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/cloud-cost-management-saved-millions/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Datadog used Cloud Cost Management to centralize visibility of cloud expenses and collaborated between FinOps and engineering to identify storage inefficiencies. Implementing optimized S3 storage classes and lifecycle rules reduced costs, generating an estimated $1.5 million in annual savings while creating a system to discover future opportunities.

[### Migrate to Amazon EKS: Data plane cost modeling with Karpenter and KWOK (7 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/migrate-to-amazon-eks-data-plane-cost-modeling-with-karpenter-and-kwok/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Organizations can simulate Kubernetes migrations to Amazon EKS using Karpenter and KWOK to observe node provisioning, optimize costs, and estimate compute requirements without launching real EC2 instances. The process involves backing up the source cluster with Velero, creating a destination EKS cluster, deploying Karpenter with KWOK for virtual nodes, restoring workloads, and analyzing resource allocation for accurate cost modeling.

[### Identify slowdowns across your entire network with Datadog Network Path (5 minute read)](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/network-path/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Datadog Network Path provides hop-by-hop visualizations of packet journeys, enabling teams to identify latency, packet loss, and device-level issues across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid networks. By integrating with Datadog's monitoring tools, it connects infrastructure behavior with application performance and end-user experience, helping teams resolve problems faster and improve reliability.

[### Why Relying on LLMs for Code Can Be a Security Nightmare (2 minute read)](https://blog.himanshuanand.com/posts/2025-08-22-llm-vibe-coding-security-nightmare/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

LLM-generated code often lacks security awareness. LLMs often mimic insecure patterns found in online examples, scaling the risk of vulnerabilities in production code. Developers should keep humans in the loop for threat modeling, abuse cases, and defense design.
