When developers know what secure code looks like, tools become more effective, and vulnerabilities never reach production. The [SANS Developer Security Playbook](https://www.sans.org/mlp/workforce-devsec-playbook?utm_medium=Sponsored_Content&utm_source=TLDR&utm_rdetail=Global&utm_goal=Leads&utm_type=Global_Campaign&utm_content=DevSec_Playbook_10.27.25&utm_campaign=WSRT_DevSec_2025) reveals how hands-on training reduces rework, protects velocity, and embeds secure coding into software lifecycles.

[### What's New in Calico v3.31: eBPF, NFTables, and More (81 minute read)](https://www.tigera.io/blog/whats-new-in-calico-v3-31-ebpf-nftables-and-more/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Calico v3.31 has been released, with the NFTables data plane now generally available, promising efficiency and performance improvements over IPTables by streamlining networking changes in the Linux kernel. Installation is now easier with a new template defaulting to the eBPF data plane, automatically disabling kube-proxy, and using bpfNetworkBootstrap to detect API server endpoints. The release also includes UI improvements for policy traces, new burst and peak rate controls for bandwidth and packet rate QoS, and finer control over NAT outgoing via natOutgoingExclusions.

[### Your Org, Your Tools: Build a Custom MCP Catalog (5 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/build-custom-mcp-catalog/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Docker's Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows organizations to build their own MCP catalog to ensure appropriate guardrails are in place for AI tooling deployment. By using Docker's MCP Toolkit, Catalog, and Gateway, organizations can control the tools available to developers, customers, or AI agents, with the MCP Catalog hosting over 220+ containerized MCP servers.

This guide explains how to extend Amazon EKS with Hybrid Nodes using AWS IAM Roles Anywhere and HashiCorp Vault PKI to securely authenticate nodes outside AWS. It details how to configure Vault as a certificate authority, establish trust with IAM Roles Anywhere, and join external Linux servers to an EKS cluster for hybrid, compliant, and low-latency workloads.

[### How We Saved $500,000 Per Year by Rolling Our Own ‚ÄúS3‚Äù (12 minute read)](https://engineering.nanit.com/how-we-saved-500-000-per-year-by-rolling-our-own-s3-6caec1ee1143?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Nanit replaced Amazon S3 as its primary video landing zone with a custom in-memory system called N3, built in Rust, to handle short-lived baby monitor video uploads. By offloading only overflow traffic to S3, it cut ~$500K per year in S3 request and storage fees while maintaining reliability and ordering guarantees through a two-tier fallback system, stress testing, and simple RAM-based storage.
