[### How I build software quickly (8 minute read)](https://evanhahn.com/how-i-build-software-quickly/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Building software quickly requires balancing speed and quality by aiming for ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù solutions based on the project's context and starting with rough, imperfect drafts to uncover unknowns early. Success comes from making small, focused changes, softening requirements when possible, avoiding distractions, and developing key skills like reading code, data modeling, and scripting.

[### Using Ansible with Docker to Automate Container Management (18 minute read)](https://spacelift.io/blog/ansible-docker?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Automation with Ansible and containerization with Docker ensure consistent and portable infrastructure across environments. Ansible simplifies Docker management by automating installation, configuration, and container lifecycle tasks through declarative YAML playbooks, making large-scale setups easier and more reliable than using shell scripts.

[### WebAssembly: Yes, but for What? (13 minute read)](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3746171&amp;utm_source=tldrdevops)

WebAssembly excels in high-performance, secure, and fast-start environments like browser plug-ins, cloud, and edge compute, but adoption for general web development lags due to ecosystem and tooling gaps. Recent advances like built-in garbage collection and the component model may expand its future use in cloud, OS, and secure AI workloads.

[### How I Discovered a Libpng Vulnerability 11 Years After It Was Patched (3 minute read)](https://blog.himanshuanand.com/posts/discovered-a-libpng-vulnerability-11-years-after-it-was-patched/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

While learning secure code review, a researcher rediscovered and analyzed CVE-2014-9495, an integer overflow vulnerability in libpng that was patched in 2014. The vulnerability involved user-controlled values like width and bit depth not being properly validated, leading to a heap buffer overflow if an attacker crafted a PNG file with specific dimensions. The analysis highlighted the importance of auditing code from source to sink and the potential for integer overflows in C to cause vulnerabilities.
