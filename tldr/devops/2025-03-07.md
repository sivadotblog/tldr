ngrok's not just for putting your localhost online anymore. We've spent the last years rebuilding it into a fully fledged API Gateway unlike any other.

We unified traffic routing, payload manipulation, global delivery, load balancing and a Kubernetes Ingress/Gateway controller into something that “just works” in any network the same way ngrok did for webhook testing all those years ago. We run all of our web services through it now :)

You could just sign up and try all of this stuff on our free plan, but [TLDR DevOps readers get 1 month](https://ngrok.com/info/api-gateway-free-trial?utm_source=tldrdevops&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=apigateway-fy26q1-evergreen&utm_content=newsletter-apigatewaytrial-signup) of our pay-as-you-go plan to take all of our highly composable api gateway functionality for a test drive with no limits.
