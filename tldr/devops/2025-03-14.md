[### Upgrading Semgrep from OCaml 4 to OCaml 5 (9 minute read)](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/upgrading-semgrep-from-ocaml-4-to-ocaml-5/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

OCaml 5 introduced multicore support but led to significant memory consumption issues for Semgrep, necessitating a deep investigation into garbage collector (GC) behavior. By tuning the GC's space\_overhead dynamically based on heap size, Semgrep was able to restore performance parity with OCaml 4, leading to a successful upgrade and the open-sourcing of the dynamic\_gc utility for broader community use.

[### Automation Can Solve Resource Overprovisioning in Kubernetes (5 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/automation-can-solve-resource-overprovisioning-in-kubernetes/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes teams often overprovision resources to ensure high performance, leading to significant cloud waste and unnecessary costs. To reduce inefficiencies, automation and better tooling are needed for dynamic resource scaling, workload optimization, and effective use of spot instances.

[### Detect cross-account access risks in AWS with Datadog (3 minute read)](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/detect-cross-account-risks-aws/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Datadog's Cloud Security Management identifies and remediates cross-account access risks by scanning for permission gaps and offering actionable insights. This is useful as managing access across multiple AWS accounts leads to IAM misconfigurations and increases the risk of privilege escalation, allowing attackers to move undetected.
