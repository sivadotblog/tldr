[### Kafka is fast -- I'll use Postgres (20 minute read)](https://topicpartition.io/blog/postgres-pubsub-queue-benchmarks?utm_source=tldrdevops)

According to recent benchmark tests, Postgres can handle many Kafka workloads with a fraction of the development effort and cost, performing at 5 MB/s ingest and 25 MB/s egress on a 3-node cluster for approximately $11,514 per year. The "Just Use Postgres" slogan is more relevant than ever because modern hardware allows it to scale absurdly high, making it a practical and simpler alternative to more complex systems like Kafka for many use cases.

A new Rust-based Python management tool called uv has transformed how developers install Python, manage dependencies, and create virtual environments, offering unmatched speed, simplicity, and cross-platform consistency. With built-in features for version pinning, project initialization, and instant one-off tool execution via uvx, it enables fully reproducible environments and seamless collaboration, making it the most significant improvement to the Python ecosystem in a decade.

[### So long, and thanks for all the fish: how to escape the Linux networking stack (11 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish-how-to-escape-the-linux-networking-stack/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare engineers explored the limits of the Linux networking stack while developing soft-unicast, a system for sharing IP subnets across data centers, and encountered complex challenges involving socket binding, NAT, and packet forwarding. After experimenting with multiple kernel-level approaches, they ultimately chose to terminate TCP connections within servers for greater reliability and visibility.
