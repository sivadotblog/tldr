Automations that were supposed to save time become a full time job. The CEO's dashboard depends on a Cron job that someone hacked up two years ago. Reports, scripts, and internal support tickets compete for dev bandwidth with product priorities.

Had enough? [Move on from fragile scripts to Ondeva](https://www.ondeva.com/solutions/centralize-automations-and-internal-tools?utm_source=newsletter_ads&utm_campaign=tldr&utm_content=fri_seventeen&utm_term=l_moveon) - the workflow automation tool for technical teams.

* Automate workflows and logic in a visual interface
* Connect services, run flows, and inject custom code where needed.
* Retries, error handling, and logging built-in.
* Built for [reliability and resilience](https://www.ondeva.com/solutions/centralize-automations-and-internal-tools?utm_source=newsletter_ads&utm_campaign=tldr&utm_content=fri_seventeen&utm_term=l_reliability)
* No infra, containers, or backends to manage

[### 10X Backbone: How Meta Is Scaling Backbone Connectivity for AI (6 minute read)](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/10/16/data-center-engineering/10x-backbone-how-meta-is-scaling-backbone-connectivity-for-ai/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Meta introduced DC metro architecture, IP platform scaling, and IP/Optical integration to scale its Backbone network to meet growing demands. These changes have allowed Meta to evolve its Express Backbone (EBB) network to support all data center traffic, with a single AI Backbone site-pair now being twice the size of the global backbone built over the last 10 years.

[### Windows When? Windows Now (3 minute read)](https://zed.dev/blog/zed-for-windows-is-here?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Zed has officially launched its stable Windows release with full platform integration, supporting DirectX 11, DirectWrite, and seamless WSL and SSH workflows. All extensions and AI features like Claude Code now work natively on Windows, with weekly updates and a dedicated Windows engineering team maintaining parity with macOS and Linux.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### Instantly respond to changes in your data with Datadog automation rules (4 minute read)](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-automation-rules/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Datadog Datastore automation rules allow workflows to trigger instantly when data is added, updated, or deleted, ensuring all processes and integrations stay current without manual intervention. This feature keeps data consistent across apps and workflows, streamlines incident management, and enables faster, automated responses to operational changes.

[### Managing Kubernetes Workloads Using the App of Apps Pattern in ArgoCD-2 (5 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/10/07/managing-kubernetes-workloads-using-the-app-of-apps-pattern-in-argocd-2/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The App of Apps pattern in ArgoCD uses a parent application to manage and deploy multiple child applications, enabling modular, version-controlled, and GitOps-driven Kubernetes deployments. This approach improves visibility, reusability, and consistency across environments while allowing automated syncing and self-healing of applications like NGINX Ingress and Cert-Manager.

[### From pillars to rings: How interconnected observability in Grafana Cloud optimizes performance and reduces telemetry waste (7 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/10/16/from-pillars-to-rings-how-interconnected-observability-in-grafana-cloud-optimizes-performance-and-reduces-telemetry-waste/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana Cloud is unifying logs, metrics, and traces to provide interconnected layers of observability, each building on the other to provide opinionated observability solutions. By connecting these signals, Grafana delivers automated, context-rich, cost-effective visibility by bundling data, guidance, and automation into solutions to optimize performance, minimize waste, and help users focus on important data. This model is already elevating the standard observability experience through Grafana Cloud solutions like Kubernetes Monitoring, Cloud Provider Observability, Application Observability, and Frontend Observability by leveraging AI-powered observability with Grafana Assistant.

[### Branching in a Sapling Monorepo (7 minute read)](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/10/16/developer-tools/branching-in-a-sapling-monorepo/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Meta has open-sourced its Sapling source control system, designed for scalable monorepo branching, along with insights from its implementation. Two key workflows, non-mergeable full-repo branching using sl bookmark and mergeable directory branching through commands like sl subtree, solve branching challenges for Meta's diverse products. To address the limitations of full-repo branching and improve code management, Sapling introduces directory branching, which allows treating monorepo directories like traditional repository branches with linear commits.

[### From key sprawl to scalable control: Rethinking SSH access (5 minute read)](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/from-key-sprawl-to-scalable-control-rethinking-ssh-access?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Static SSH keys create security and operational challenges at scale due to long lifetimes, sharing, and lack of auditability, while SSH certificates provide short-lived, signed access controlled by a certificate authority. HashiCorp Vault and Boundary streamline SSH certificate management by dynamically generating and injecting ephemeral credentials, enabling secure, auditable, and scalable SSH access with centralized policy and minimal user overhead.

[### Improving the trustworthiness of JavaScript on the Web (20 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/improving-the-trustworthiness-of-javascript-on-the-web/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Web Application Integrity, Consistency, and Transparency (WAICT), a W3C-backed effort, aims to bring stronger security to the web by providing integrity, consistency, and transparency for web applications using in-browser JavaScript cryptography. The system uses subresource integrity (SRI) and integrity manifests to ensure that the code a user receives matches the code on record, addressing the vulnerability of JavaScript cryptography to malicious modification. To maintain the append-only nature of the chain, a trusted third party, called a witness, verifies hash chain consistency, signs the new chain hash with a timestamp, and adds it to a prefix tree that maps site domains to log chain hashes, creating a transparency preload list for client browsers.
