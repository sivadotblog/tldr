Evaluating DevOps platforms? Forrester's already done the legwork...

The [Forrester Wave™: DevOps Platforms, Q2 2025](https://www.atlassian.com/forrester/forrester-wave-devops) report benchmarks the leading vendors on strategy, current offering, and market presence. Atlassian earned Leader status, scoring 5/5 on Vision, Innovation, and Roadmap.

The report breaks down what separates modern DevOps platforms from the pack: [AI-native tooling](https://www.atlassian.com/forrester/forrester-wave-devops), unified Dev and IT workflows, and CI/CD that actually scales.

Whether you're evaluating vendors or benchmarking your current stack, it's worth a read.

[### Making WebAssembly a first-class language on the Web (11 minute read)](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2026/02/making-webassembly-a-first-class-language-on-the-web/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

WebAssembly has matured technically but remains second-class on the web because it depends on JavaScript for loading and Web API access, adding complexity and overhead. The WebAssembly Component Model aims to make Wasm first-class by enabling standardized, direct integration with web APIs without JavaScript glue.

[### Introducing PgBeam (3 minute read)](https://pgbeam.com/launch?utm_source=tldrdevops)

PgBeam is a globally distributed PostgreSQL proxy that reduces latency by routing connections to the nearest edge location, maintaining pooled upstream connections, and caching SELECT query results—requiring only a connection string change. Benchmarks show 3–5× faster response times in distant regions by eliminating repeated TLS/auth handshakes and serving cached reads locally, though it supports read caching only, allows up to 60s staleness, and does not replicate data.

[### How Dropbox Built a Scalable Context Engine for Enterprise Knowledge Search (3 minute read)](https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/dropbox-context-engine/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Dropbox engineers built the context engine behind Dropbox Dash using pre-processed, permission-aware indexing and knowledge graph-derived bundles to avoid costly runtime API calls, reduce latency, and limit tool sprawl. Leveraging consolidated retrieval tools, model-based evaluation with DSPy, and patterns similar to Microsoft 365 Copilot, the design reflects a broader enterprise shift toward pre-computed, continuously evaluated context systems.

[### Git in Postgres (5 minute read)](https://nesbitt.io/2026/02/26/git-in-postgres.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Git's object and ref model can be implemented directly in Postgres, allowing standard Git clients to push and clone without noticing any difference while enabling SQL queries over commits, trees, and related app data. This unifies forge metadata and repository storage in a single database—simplifying backups, scaling, and integrations—at the cost of higher storage usage compared to Git's delta-compressed packfiles.

[### How to scale GitOps in the enterprise: From single cluster to fleet management (8 minute read)](https://platformengineering.org/blog/how-to-scale-gitops-in-the-enterprise?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Scaling GitOps beyond 20 to 50 clusters can create performance bottlenecks, config sprawl, and cultural friction known as the Argo Ceiling, requiring evolved state stores like OCI or ConfigHub, stronger secrets and policy controls, and deliberate topology design. With disciplined architecture, progressive delivery, and tools such as Argo CD, Flux CD, and Sveltos, small teams can reliably manage large multi cluster fleets at enterprise scale.

[### TFVC Remove Existing Obsolete Policies ASAP (4 minute read)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/tfvc-remove-existing-obsolete-policies-asap/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

In April 2025, Team Foundation Version Control began phasing out legacy check-in policies due to storage limitations, entering a final stage where obsolete policies will block check-ins and disappear from Team Explorer. Administrators must replace them in Visual Studio or remove them using a C# console app with Microsoft.TeamFoundationServer.ExtendedClient to restore compliance.

Broadcom engineers published a guide detailing how to make Harbor, an open-source container registry, production-ready on Kubernetes by implementing high availability configurations, TLS/SSL security, vulnerability scanning with Trivy, and integration with enterprise identity providers like LDAP or OIDC. The guide emphasizes eliminating single points of failure through shared storage solutions, highly available PostgreSQL and Redis clusters, and proactive monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
