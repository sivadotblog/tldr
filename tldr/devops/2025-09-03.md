Testing web apps can be brutal: a designer changes one CSS class, and your entire test suite explodes.

[Momentic's AI](https://momentic.ai/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=09032025) doesn't care about DOM changes. Tell it to "click the blue submit button" and it finds the blue button — whether you call it .btn-primary or .submit-btn-v2.

Here's why Notion, Webflow, Retool. and 100s of other companies test with Momentic:

🗣️ [Write tests in plain English](https://momentic.ai/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=09032025): "user can log in to the dashboard"

🤕 Auto-healing locators find elements by descriptions, not XPath.

🌤️ Multi-modal assertions validate screenshots, page content, and expected behavior.

[### Bitnami Ends Free, Stable Images — Users Forced to Migrate or Pay (4 minute read)](https://linuxiac.com/bitnami-ends-free-stable-images-users-forced-to-migrate-or-pay/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Bitnami is shutting down its long-standing free Docker Hub repository and moving all existing images to an unsupported Legacy repo, while only offering limited “latest” free images under a new namespace. Developers who need stable versions or enterprise-grade support must purchase a costly Bitnami Secure Images subscription, forcing many smaller users to migrate away or face broken deployments.

[### Python has had async for 10 years -- why isn't it more popular? (10 minute read)](https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/why-isnt-python-async-more-popular.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Python added async/await in 2015, but adoption has lagged because its benefits are mostly limited to network I/O, while file and CPU-bound tasks remain blocked by the GIL and require awkward workarounds. Maintaining parallel sync/async APIs is also burdensome. With Python 3.14 introducing free-threading and multiple interpreters, broader concurrency and parallelism may finally become practical beyond web servers.

[### The crawl-to-click gap: Cloudflare data on AI bots, training, and referrals (9 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/crawlers-click-ai-bots-training/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Generative AI is reshaping internet traffic as AI crawlers now account for most web consumption, with training driving nearly 80% of AI bot activity while referrals to publishers decline sharply. Googlebot remains the largest crawler overall, but AI-focused bots like GPTBot, ClaudeBot, and Meta's agent surged in 2025 as Google referrals to news sites fell 9–15% compared with early in the year.
