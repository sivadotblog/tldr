### Opinions & Tutorials

[### Introducing Spacelift Plugins: Extensibility Meets Infrastructure as Code (6 minute read)](https://spacelift.io/blog/introducing-spacelift-plugins?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Spacelift Plugins is an open-source, extensible way to natively integrate security, cost, compliance, secrets, and custom tools into infrastructure workflows. It reduces CI/CD complexity while standardizing and scaling DevOps pipelines with community and custom integrations.

[### Private AI Coding: OpenCode + Model Runner (6 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/opencode-docker-model-runner-private-ai-coding/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

By combining OpenCode, an open-source coding assistant, with Docker Model Runner, developers can achieve a privacy-first and cost-aware AI-assisted development experience, keeping all model inference within their controlled infrastructure. This setup allows teams to run large language models locally via an OpenAI-compatible API. It offers significant cost advantages and customization options for models and context windows.

[### More HTTP/3 Focus, One Backend Less (2 minute read)](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2026/01/17/more-http-3-focus-one-backend-less/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

curl is removing support for the OpenSSL-QUIC backend and will now support only two HTTP/3 options: ngtcp2 + nghttp3 (primary) and quiche (still experimental), starting with curl 8.19.0. The OpenSSL-QUIC backend never left experimental due to a weak API, significantly worse performance, and dramatically higher memory usage compared to ngtcp2.

[### Why We've Tried To Replace Developers Every Decade Since 1969 (7 minute read)](https://www.caimito.net/en/blog/2025/12/07/the-recurring-dream-of-replacing-developers.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

For over 50 years, each wave of “developer-replacing” technology—from COBOL and CASE tools to low-code and AI—has promised to simplify software creation but failed because it can't eliminate the underlying complexity of reasoning through edge cases, tradeoffs, and systems behavior. New tools consistently increase leverage and productivity, but software development remains fundamentally an intellectual problem, not a mechanical one, so developers are augmented rather than replaced.

[### Context Engineering Lessons from Building Azure SRE Agent (8 minute read)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/context-engineering-lessons-from-building-azure-sre-agent/4481200?utm_source=tldrdevops)

An Azure team improved an Azure SRE agent by collapsing many narrow tools and specialized sub-agents into a few wide tools and generalists. They discovered that disciplined context engineering, not model upgrades or orchestration complexity, was the primary driver of production reliability.
