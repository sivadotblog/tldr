GitLab is evolving into an AI-native DevSecOps platform by integrating AI across its unified data layer, software control plane, and user experience to enable seamless human-AI collaboration throughout the software lifecycle. With the release of 18.3, GitLab introduces expanded AI integrations, new automated development flows, real-time code intelligence via its Knowledge Graph, stronger governance and security features, enterprise-grade artifact protection, and embedded views for real-time project visibility.

[### AWS Lambda now supports GitHub Actions to simplify function deployment (2 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/08/aws-lambda-github-actions-function-deployment/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AWS Lambda now integrates with GitHub Actions, allowing automatic deployment of functions when code or configuration changes are pushed to a repository, reducing manual scripting and deployment errors. The new action supports .zip and container image deployments, integrates with IAM via OIDC, and offers configurable settings such as runtime, memory, and environment variables.

[### MoQ: Refactoring the Internet's real-time media stack (14 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/moq/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare has launched the first Media over QUIC (MoQ) relay network across its 330+ global datacenters, joining companies like Meta and Google in building implementations of the open-source protocol at the IETF. MoQ aims to unify streaming by combining the low latency of WebRTC, the scalability of HLS/DASH, and the simplicity of RTMP using the UDP-based QUIC protocol to eliminate bottlenecks and reduce latency to sub-second speeds.

[### Designing a multi-tenant GKE platform for Yahoo Mail's migration journey (7 minute read)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/understanding-yahoo-mails-multi-tenant-gke-platform-design/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Yahoo Mail is migrating its application to Google Cloud using a multi-tenant GKE platform that combines lift-and-shift for most services with strategic replatforming of key components to leverage cloud-native capabilities. The design emphasizes high availability, workload isolation, access control, network policies, and capacity planning, while addressing challenges like secure connectivity, end-to-end mTLS, and integration with internal identity systems.

[### How to monitor your homelab with Beyla, eBPF, and OpenTelemetry (7 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/08/22/how-to-monitor-your-homelab-with-beyla-ebpf-and-opentelemetry/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Beyla, an open source eBPF-based, zero-code instrumentation tool, makes homelab observability easy by using OpenTelemetry to provide application and network observability for any Linux application, collecting consistent, OpenTelemetry-compliant rate, error, and duration (RED) metrics and distributed traces from uninstrumented applications. It allows users to extract telemetry from HTTP and Redis protocols in a runtime-agnostic manner, collecting metadata such as Kubernetes labels and zone information for troubleshooting. Beyla has been donated to the OpenTelemetry project under the name OpenTelemetry eBPF Instrumentation.

[### How I Team Up with GenAI to Craft Conference Talk Proposals (20 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/08/22/how-i-team-up-with-genai-to-craft-conference-talk-proposals/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

While GenAI can assist in writing conference abstracts, reviewers can easily identify proposals lacking personal curiosity and human input. This article outlines a process for co-writing abstracts with GenAI that preserves the author's voice and experience. It involves brainstorming with AI, shaping the story, and iterating on the abstract while avoiding common AI writing tells. By using AI as a teammate, speakers can create more authentic and compelling proposals that stand out to reviewers.

[### What Is Terraform GUI? Top 5 Visual Tools Compared (10 minute read)](https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-gui?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Terraform GUIs provide visual interfaces for managing Terraform configurations, enabling teams to plan, apply, and monitor infrastructure without relying on the CLI. Tools like Terraform GUI, Gaia, Spacelift, Semaphore, and Terraform Cloud offer varying features for collaboration, policy enforcement, workflow automation, and multi-environment management.

[### Why Was Apache Kafka Created? (13 minute read)](https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/why-was-apache-kafka-created?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kafka was born at LinkedIn in 2012 to unify brittle, siloed pipelines into a robust, scalable, real-time system with schema-driven data integration and clear ownership. Despite schemas being central to its origin, Kafka never made them first-class, leading to fragmentation and weak enforcement‚Äîsomething newer players like Buf are now addressing head-on.
