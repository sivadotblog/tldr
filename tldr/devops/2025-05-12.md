### Opinions & Tutorials

[### How to Build a Scalable and Cost-Effective Mass Email Service with AWS SES, SQS, Lambda, S3, and CloudWatch (5 minute read)](https://dev.to/dandipangestu/how-to-build-a-scalable-and-cost-effective-mass-email-service-with-aws-ses-sqs-lambda-s3-and-1e1f?utm_source=tldrdevops)

One way to build a scalable mass email service on AWS involves using S3 to store recipient CSV files, which trigger a Lambda function to extract email addresses and enqueue them in SQS. A second Lambda function reads from the queue to send each email through SES, while CloudWatch logs events for monitoring and troubleshooting.

[### Enforce CloudFront-Only Access for AWS API Gateway (4 minute read)](https://pubudu.dev/posts/access-api-gw-rest-api-only-from-cloudfront?utm_source=tldrdevops)

An AWS API Gateway can be securely exposed through CloudFront by using a custom header validated by a Lambda authorizer, with the header value stored and rotated using AWS SSM and a scheduled Lambda function. This setup ensures secure communication between CloudFront and API Gateway while automating header rotation to enhance security.

[### Behind the Scenes: Building a Robust Ads Event Processing Pipeline (8 minute read)](https://netflixtechblog.com/behind-the-scenes-building-a-robust-ads-event-processing-pipeline-e4e86caf9249?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Netflix developed a scalable and resilient ads event processing pipeline to power its advertising platform that evolved from a basic setup reliant on Microsoft to a sophisticated in-house system. By introducing a centralized event publisher, key-value metadata storage, and streamlining telemetry processing, Netflix enabled rapid iteration, accurate reporting, billing, and compliance while supporting new ad formats like display and interactive ads.

[### Building OpenAI-Compatible AWS Lambda Service (3 minute read)](https://medium.com/@chiragyaduwanshi2001/building-openai-compatible-aws-lambda-service-7f0efb4b7d7b?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The OpenAI API's growing popularity has led developers to seek ways to integrate it seamlessly with custom services, but using AWS Lambda with API Gateway can create compatibility and authentication issues. A better solution involves using an Application Load Balancer to route traffic to Lambda, which bypasses these problems and allows for easy integration with the OpenAI Python client.
