[### An In-Depth Look at Istio Ambient Mode with Calico (10 minute read)](https://www.tigera.io/blog/an-in-depth-look-at-istio-ambient-mode-with-calico/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Tigera has introduced a unified platform that integrates Istio Ambient Mode with Calico, offering a sidecarless service mesh solution designed to simplify Kubernetes networking, security, and L7 observability across clusters by eliminating fragmented tools and reducing operational overhead. This integration provides crucial capabilities like mTLS encryption, L4/L7 traffic control, and deep application-level observability while preserving existing network policies.

[### What I Look For in AI-Assisted PRs (5 minute read)](https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2025/12/10/What-I-Look-For-in-AI-Assisted-PRs/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

As AI makes it easier to generate code, the burden on reviewers increases, requiring strong heuristics that assess clarity of PR descriptions, reversibility of changes, appropriate scope, coherent abstractions, meaningful tests, and healthy error-handling while watching for “vibe” code smells that indicate low human curation. AI can help with first-pass review but still struggles with conceptual design issues, so human judgment—and eventually stronger verification tools—remain essential as code volume rapidly scales.

[### Postman Workspace Leaks: When Your API Testing Tool Becomes a Data Breach (12 minute read)](https://instatunnel.my/blog/postman-workspace-leaks-when-your-api-testing-tool-becomes-a-data-breach?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A year-long investigation revealed that more than 30,000 public Postman workspaces leaked sensitive API keys, tokens, and credentials, exposing organizations across healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and tech to real-world breaches and financial risk. The incident highlights how simple misconfigurations, insecure developer practices, and weak defaults in collaboration tools can escalate into widespread, high-impact security failures.

[### The case of .Net Central Package Management and Azure DevOps Pipelines (3 minute read)](https://www.itwriting.com/blog/12365-the-case-of-net-central-package-management-and-azure-devops-pipelines.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A .NET 10 project using Central Package Management failed in an Ubuntu-based Azure pipeline because the required Directory.Packages.props file was miscapitalized, which Windows and macOS tolerated but Linux rejected. Renaming the file with correct casing resolved the NU1015 errors and restored pipeline builds.
