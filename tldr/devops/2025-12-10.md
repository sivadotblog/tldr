[### How Coinbase delivers 10x engineering output using AI for Prod (Sponsor)](https://luma.com/agu9mak2?utm_source=tldr-primary-devops&amp;utm_medium=dec-2025&amp;utm_id=ai-for-prod-engineering)

The market's done a great job with AI agents for coding. It's time engineers have tools to fight the other half of the battle: managing prod.

Great AI for production systems does 3 things: resolves incidents, optimizes cost+performance, and streamlines development. [Customers like Coinbase](https://luma.com/agu9mak2?utm_source=tldr-primary-devops&utm_medium=dec-2025&utm_id=ai-for-prod-engineering), DoorDash, and Zscaler choose Resolve AI as their daily debugging and decision-making partner because it -

* plays nicely with existing tools
* plugs directly into incident workflows, and
* closes the loop on reliability on the daily

....all while getting smarter with every interaction.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### How we deploy the largest GitLab instance 12 times daily (12 minute read)](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/continuously-deploying-the-largest-gitlab-instance/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

GitLab deploys code to GitLab.com up to 12 times daily using its own CI/CD platform, leveraging Canary deployments, progressive rollouts, and multiversion compatibility to ensure zero downtime. The deployment pipeline manages both containerized and traditional services, runs backward-compatible database migrations in Canary before post-deploy changes, and validates every stage through automated tests to maintain stability at scale.

[### Building microservices the easy way with Dapr (4 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/12/09/building-microservices-the-easy-way-with-dapr/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The Dapr project, an open-source Distributed Application Runtime under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), recently graduated in October 2024, simplifying microservices development. Co-created by Yaron Schneider, Dapr leverages an intelligent sidecar to handle complexities like messaging, observability, and AI/LLM integration, drastically cutting development time.

[### Join the on-call roster, it'll change your life (5 minute read)](https://serce.me/posts/2025-12-09-join-oncall-it-will-change-your-life?utm_source=tldrdevops)

On-call can accelerate your growth as an engineer by building stress tolerance, leadership, and deep systems expertise through real incidents. However, it also imposes lifestyle limits and serious sleep- and health-related risks, so it's only worthwhile if those impacts are kept under control.

### Miscellaneous

[### A New Approach for Coding Agent Safety (4 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-sandboxes-a-new-approach-for-coding-agent-safety/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Coding agents are gaining autonomy and need controlled access, prompting Docker to introduce experimental container-based sandboxes that isolate agent workflows while mirroring local workspaces. The preview supports Claude Code and Gemini CLI and will evolve toward microVM isolation, stronger controls, and broader agent compatibility.

[### Cloud security, the right way: What the industry should demand (and why "good enough" isn't) (4 minute read)](https://www.sysdig.com/blog/cloud-security-the-right-way-what-the-industry-should-demand-and-why-good-enough-isnt?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloud security teams face pressure that drives compromises. CNAPP must evolve to unify shift left controls with real-time runtime visibility, open innovation, and truly agentic AI that reasons and acts autonomously. Raising the industry standard toward transparent, community-driven, runtime-aware security eliminates blind spots and avoids the speed versus safety tradeoff.
