[### AI and Code Security: Hype vs. Reality (Sponsor)](https://amplify.security/latio-guide?utm_source=TLDR&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=TLDR&amp;utm_id=aprdevops)

The AI security landscape is evolving fast, and vendors are racing to prove their tools can deliver real-world value. But how effective is AI in actually fixing security vulnerabilities?

A 2025 [report by Latio Tech](https://amplify.security/latio-guide?utm_source=TLDR&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_id=aprdevops) assesses different technical approaches and vendors to help security professionals and engineering leaders cut through the hype and understand which AI-driven tools provide meaningful value‚Äîand which ones fall short.

Vendors were evaluated based on their capability to detect or ingest SAST reports, create [actual code fixes](https://amplify.security/latio-guide?utm_source=TLDR&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_id=aprdevops), and support AppSec teams in reducing vulnerabilities efficiently.
