[### 8 API gateway patterns for distributed development, microservices, AI, and more (Sponsor)](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/api-gateway-shapes-patterns-2025?utm_source=tldrdevops&amp;utm_medium=paid-community&amp;utm_campaign=apigateway-fy26q3-evergreen&amp;utm_content=blog_api-gateway-shapes)

API gateways used to be a monolith that sat between the big scary internet and your production services - but this model doesn't really fit the way software is built today.

This [blog by ngrok](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/api-gateway-shapes-patterns-2025?utm_source=tldrdevops&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=apigateway-fy26q3-evergreen&utm_content=blog_api-gateway-shapes) looks at the "shapes" of API gateways that are more relevant today - including building with agents, exposing ephemeral workloads, self-hosting a PaaS, and more.

[### Jenkins' Flexibility is its Greatest Strength and its Achilles Heel (7 minute read)](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/why-jenkins-governance-matters-from-chaos-to-enterprise-grade-ci-cd?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Jenkins' challenges in enterprises stem from poor governance rather than flaws in the tool itself, as unchecked plugin sprawl, inconsistent configurations, and weak access controls create fragility and maintenance burdens. With centralized governance, automation, and compliance frameworks like those provided by CloudBees, Jenkins becomes a scalable, secure, and enterprise-grade CI/CD solution that enables faster, more reliable software delivery.

[### A deep dive into BPF LPM trie performance and optimization (9 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-deep-dive-into-bpf-lpm-trie-performance-and-optimization/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A deep dive into the BPF LPM trie, a data structure crucial for network packet routing, revealed performance bottlenecks when storing millions of entries, such as entry lookup times taking hundreds of milliseconds and freeing maps locking up a CPU for over 10 seconds. Benchmarks highlighted that freeing a BPF LPM trie with 10K entries can cause soft lockup messages in production, with throughput decreasing to around 1.5 million ops/sec at 1 million entries due to L1 dcache and dTLB miss rates.

[### Salesforce Commerce Cloud migrates from Self-hosted Prometheus to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (8 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/salesforce-commerce-cloud-migrates-from-self-hosted-prometheus-to-amazon-managed-service-for-prometheus/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Salesforce Commerce Cloud migrated from a self-hosted Prometheus and Thanos stack to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, achieving a 40% reduction in AWS costs and eliminating monitoring-related maintenance. The new setup improves scalability, reliability, and cross-cluster visibility.

[### GitHub Copilot CLI: How to get started (6 minute read)](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/github-copilot-cli-how-to-get-started/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

GitHub Copilot CLI brings AI assistance directly to the terminal, allowing developers to clone repositories, debug, manage dependencies, and even open pull requests without leaving the command line. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub accounts, supports secure command approvals, and can be extended with MCP servers to fit custom workflows.

[### Leveling up your deployment pipelines (7 minute read)](https://octopus.com/blog/leveling-up-deployment-pipelines?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Organizations typically evolve their internal developer platforms through three stages: deployment, secure, and DevOps pipelines, each adding automation, security, and productivity features. This progression forms a practical maturity model where teams first automate delivery, then integrate security, and finally enhance developer experience through documentation, infrastructure automation, and one-click setup.

[### The LinkedIn Generative AI Application Tech Stack: Extending to Build AI Agents (10 minute read)](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/generative-ai/the-linkedin-generative-ai-application-tech-stack-extending-to-build-ai-agents?utm_source=tldrdevops)

LinkedIn's generative AI application tech stack was updated to improve AI agents by enabling them to think, plan, and act with users, with the Hiring Assistant being globally available in English by the end of September. Key to this development were defining agents through gRPC service schema definitions and leveraging LinkedIn's messaging system for multi-agent orchestration. Agent interactions were also engineered to be seamless, and a hybrid observability strategy was adopted for agent development.
