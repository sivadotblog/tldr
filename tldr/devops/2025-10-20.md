[### Ingest OTLP metrics directly into Datadog with the new OTLP Metrics API (3 minute read)](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/otlp-metrics-api/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Datadog has launched a new OTLP Metrics API, enabling direct ingestion of OpenTelemetry metrics from serverless environments, cloud-provider managed OTel distributions, and applications emitting metrics in OTLP. The API expands observability options by making it easier to capture and analyze telemetry data from environments where collectors can't be deployed, such as Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and Cloudflare Workers. This new API complements Datadog's existing OTel APIs for logs and traces, providing a comprehensive framework for routing OTLP data into the platform.

[### Load Balancing Monitor Groups: Multi-Service Health Checks for Resilient Applications (6 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/load-balancing-monitor-groups-multi-service-health-checks-for-resilient/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare has introduced Monitor Groups for its Load Balancing service, allowing users to bundle multiple health monitors into a single entity for more accurate application availability assessments. Available via API for Enterprise customers now and coming to the dashboard for all Load Balancing users soon, Monitor Groups enable sophisticated, multi-service health checks by designating critical components and using aggregated health scores for failover decisions. Users can add up to five monitors to a group, designating them as critical or observational and setting a quorum-based threshold to avoid false positives.

[### Reducing EKS cross-AZ cost using Cilium (4 minute read)](https://dev.to/hstiwana/using-cilium-to-reduce-cross-az-costs-on-aws-5138?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cilium, an eBPF-powered networking solution, helps reduce cross-Availability Zone (AZ) traffic costs on AWS Kubernetes clusters. By using features like topology-aware routing and ENI mode integration, Cilium ensures traffic stays within the same AZ whenever possible. It employs the Linux kernel's eBPF technology to transform Kubernetes networking with efficiency and deep visibility.

[### Optimize GitLab object storage for scale and performance (4 minute read)](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/optimize-gitlab-object-storage-for-scale-and-performance/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

GitLab object storage should use a consolidated form with IAM-based authentication, dedicated buckets, server-side encryption, and proxy\_download settings optimized for performance. The container registry requires separate configuration with the s3\_v2 driver, IAM authentication, encryption, and redirect-based direct downloads to ensure reliability and security.

[### A deep dive into Java garbage collectors (10 minute read)](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/understanding-java-gc/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Java utilizes garbage collection (GC) to automatically reclaim memory, freeing developers from manual memory management but introducing performance tradeoffs. Modern JVMs use generational GC, dividing the heap into young and old generations, with OpenJDK offering several collectors like Serial GC for small heaps, Parallel GC for high throughput, G1 for balanced performance, and Shenandoah/ZGC for low latency applications. The choice of GC depends on whether the application prioritizes throughput or low latency, with ZGC becoming the default in JDK 23.
