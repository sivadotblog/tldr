### News & Trends

[### Control content use for AI training with Cloudflare's managed robots.txt and blocking for monetized content (13 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/control-content-use-for-ai-training/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare has introduced two new tools that allow website owners to easily manage whether AI bots can access their content for model training, including a fully managed robots.txt file and an option to block AI crawlers on ad-monetized pages.

[### Docker Desktop 4.43: Expanded Model Runner, Reimagined MCP Catalog, MCP Server Submissions, and Smarter Gordon (8 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-desktop-4-43/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Docker Desktop 4.43 was released with updates that streamline running, managing, and securing AI models and MCP tools. The release includes improvements to the Docker Model Runner UI and inference APIs, a more searchable MCP Catalog, OAuth support for the MCP Toolkit, multi-threaded conversations for Docker's AI Agent Gordon, and Compose Bridge for converting compose.yaml files into Kubernetes configuration.

[### InfluxDB 3 Core: a complete rewrite designed for speed and simplicity (4 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/07/03/influxdb-3-core-a-complete-rewrite-designed-for-speed-and-simplicity/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

At GrafanaCON 2025, InfluxData CTO Paul Dix presented InfluxDB 3 Core, the new open source version of InfluxDB, which was rewritten from Go to Rust and designed for simplicity and speed. New features of InfluxDB 3 Core include unlimited cardinality, native SQL support, and separation of compute and storage, allowing users to handle high cardinality without sacrificing performance and use object stores for historical data.

[### Stop Deploying Just To Test! (5 minute read)](https://metalbear.co/blog/stop-deploying-to-test/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Staging environments are primarily valuable for final integration and pre-release validation, but developers often experience slow feedback loops due to CI/CD pipelines that spin up test environments for every incremental change. Remocal workflows, like the one offered by mirrord, allow developers to connect local applications directly to a staging environment without a full deployment cycle, thus improving feedback and surfacing integration issues early.

[### Writing Code Was Never The Bottleneck (2 minute read)](https://ordep.dev/posts/writing-code-was-never-the-bottleneck?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The true bottleneck in software engineering has never been writing code, but rather the human-intensive tasks like code reviews, debugging, knowledge sharing, and coordination ‚Äî all of which are amplified, not eliminated, by LLMs. While LLMs accelerate code generation, they increase the burden of understanding, verifying, and maintaining that code, making collaboration and shared context more critical than ever.

[### You should delete tests (3 minute read)](https://andre.arko.net/2025/06/30/you-should-delete-tests/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Tests are intended to build confidence in code changes, but many end up undermining that goal, especially when they're flaky, outdated, overly brittle, or never actually run. Rather than treating all tests as sacred, teams should delete any that introduce noise, false signals, or unnecessary maintenance, and replace them only when they directly support current behavior and requirements.

[### Just say no: Build defense in depth with IAM Deny and Org Policies (5 minute read)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/just-say-no-build-defense-in-depth-with-iam-deny-and-org-policies/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Google Cloud's IAM Deny policies add a critical layer of explicit restriction to Google Cloud's IAM framework by allowing organizations to define which actions are never allowed, regardless of granted roles. IAM Deny enhances enforcement of least privilege and centralizes control of sensitive permissions across cloud environments when used alongside Policy Simulator, IAM Recommender, and Terraform.

[### Observing Agentic AI workloads using Amazon CloudWatch (6 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/observing-agentic-ai-workloads-using-amazon-cloudwatch/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Agentic AI applications built with frameworks like Strands Agents can be instrumented using OpenTelemetry to track execution metrics, traces, and logs, enabling detailed insight into agent workflows and tool usage. By deploying these applications on AWS EC2 and configuring Amazon CloudWatch to ingest and analyze the telemetry, developers can monitor performance and ensure operational reliability.

Cloud attacks happen fast, but patching is slow due to overload and lack of context.

[### Introducing pay per crawl: enabling content owners to charge AI crawlers for access (5 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pay-per-crawl/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare has introduced a system called pay per crawl that allows content creators to charge AI crawlers for access to their digital content using HTTP status code 402.
