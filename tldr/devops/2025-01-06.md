[### Databases in 2024: A Year in Review (16 minute read)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2025/01/2024-databases-retrospective.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The database landscape in 2024 was marked by turbulence, including major license changes (Redis and Elasticsearch), intensifying competition (Databricks vs. Snowflake), and the rise of DuckDB as a go-to analytical tool. Other highlights include significant funding rounds, new DBMS releases, industry consolidations, and Larry Ellison's headline-grabbing exploits, underscoring the continued evolution and drama in the database world.

[### Things we learned about LLMs in 2024 (24 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The LLM landscape in 2024 saw transformative advancements, including breaking the GPT-4 barrier, dramatic price drops due to efficiency gains, and the rise of multimodal models incorporating vision, audio, and live video. Despite these innovations, challenges like uneven knowledge distribution, usability complexity, and ongoing environmental concerns remain critical areas for improvement.

[### iTerm2 Critical Security Fix (1 minute read)](https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2-3_5_11.changelog?utm_source=tldrdevops)

iTerm2 version 3.5.11 fixes a critical security issue where the SSH integration feature in versions 3.5.6–3.5.10 (and associated betas) logged input/output to a file (/tmp/framer.txt) potentially accessible to other users. Users should upgrade to 3.5.11 immediately and delete the log file from affected hosts.

[### How Falco Brought Real-Time Observability to Infrastructure (3 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/how-falco-brought-real-time-observability-to-infrastructure/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Falco brought real-time observability to infrastructure by collecting kernel-level events using eBPF technology, enabling the tool to monitor applications at runtime. It captures data like pod names and namespaces, correlates events with rules, and provides immediate insights without relying on static code analysis.

[### Pinterest's Use of Honeycomb for Enhanced CI Observability and Build Stability (3 minute read)](https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/12/pinterest-honeycomb-enhanced-ci/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Pinterest's Mobile Builds team uses Honeycomb's data observability platform to improve Continuous Integration (CI) processes by analyzing build metrics, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing pipeline performance. Honeycomb's advanced visualization tools and trace views help the team quickly diagnose issues, categorize errors, and enhance troubleshooting efficiency across CI workflows.

[### Back to Basics: Why We Chose Long Polling Over WebSockets (6 minute read)](https://www.inferable.ai/blog/posts/postgres-nodejs-longpolling.mdx?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This article explores the implementation of HTTP long polling for real-time updates in a Node.js/TypeScript backend handling worker nodes and agents with PostgreSQL. Despite initial interest in WebSockets, long polling proved advantageous due to its simplicity, compatibility with existing infrastructure, and lack of additional state management or observability challenges, while best practices like TTL, polling intervals, and database optimization ensure reliability and efficiency.

[### Tetragon: 2024 in Review (5 minute read)](https://cilium.io/blog/2024/12/31/tetragon-2024-year-in-review/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Tetragon achieved remarkable growth in 2024, introducing features like Kubernetes Identity-Aware Policies, persistent enforcement, and expanded runtime support, while strengthening its community through monthly meetings and conference engagements. With increasing adoption and a focus on innovation, Tetragon continues to set standards for eBPF-based security and observability.

[### Multi-Path TCP: revolutionizing connectivity, one path at a time (8 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/multi-path-tcp-revolutionizing-connectivity-one-path-at-a-time/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) enhances traditional TCP by enabling simultaneous use of multiple network paths, improving bandwidth aggregation and connection mobility, though current implementations are limited and require configuration, with best use seen in Linux servers and macOS/iOS clients. While promising, MPTCP's maturity is case-dependent, and ongoing improvements are needed for broader adoption. Multi-Path QUIC is also under development.
