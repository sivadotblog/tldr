[### Making Documentation Simpler and Practical: Our Docs-as-Code Journey (6 minute read)](https://engineering.squarespace.com/blog/2025/making-documentation-simpler-and-practical-our-docs-as-code-journey?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The Squarespace Domains engineering team has embraced a "Docs-as-Code" (DaC) philosophy, integrating documentation with code in Git for version control and pull request reviews. By using Markdown, Mermaid syntax, and Backstage as a developer portal, the team has streamlined documentation, improved traceability, and enabled faster iteration on technical documents. The team also uses local previews with the Intellij Mermaid plugin and remote previews in a staging environment to verify documentation changes before they go live.

[### The Great Software Quality Collapse: How We Normalized Catastrophe (6 minute read)](https://techtrenches.substack.com/p/the-great-software-quality-collapse?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Software quality has collapsed as companies prioritize speed, abstraction, and infrastructure spending over disciplined engineering. Once-unthinkable failures—from apps leaking tens of gigabytes of memory to billion-dollar outages and AI-driven data loss—have become normalized, creating a cycle of inefficiency and reliance on massive hardware investments instead of fixing fundamental code quality issues.

[### The illegible nature of software development talent (2 minute read)](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/10/08/the-illegible-nature-of-software-development-talent/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Many of the most talented software engineers are nearly invisible from the outside—they don't post online, maintain flashy GitHubs, or meet rigid performance rubrics, yet consistently deliver high-impact, high-quality work. Because hiring and promotion systems rely on visible signals, organizations often overlook these “quiet” engineers, favoring what's legible over what's truly valuable.
