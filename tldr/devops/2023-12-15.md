[### Our Journey Migrating to AWS IMDSv2 (11 minute read)](https://slack.engineering/our-journey-migrating-to-aws-imdsv2/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Slack, a heavy user of Amazon EC2, shares its journey of migrating from Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) v1 to v2 for enhanced security. IMDSv2 introduces session-oriented requests, thwarting potential SSRF vulnerabilities and fortifying protection against unauthorized access. The article details Slack's comprehensive approach, involving monitoring, Terraform modules, AWS Service Control Policies, and a custom service named IMDSv1 Terminator, showcasing a collaborative effort to enforce IMDSv2 security standards across their extensive AWS infrastructure.

[### GitHub Outage in November (3 minute read)](https://github.blog/2023-12-13-github-availability-report-november-2023/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

In November, GitHub experienced a 38-minute-long incident causing degraded performance due to a memory leak in the authorization microservice. The leak, triggered by high traffic, led to repeated crashes starting at 18:42 UTC on November 3, with recovery completed at 19:08 UTC after a rollback. To prevent future incidents, GitHub implemented changes to its rollout strategy, adding monitoring checks and removing dependencies between the authorization service and rollback tools.

[### Cost saving strategies for large enterprise cloud migrations (3 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/cost-saving-strategies-for-large-enterprise-cloud-migrations/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

To ensure a successful cloud migration, organizations should begin by crafting a data-driven business case, aligning migration with tangible business outcomes, and leveraging tools like the AWS Migration Evaluator. The migration process should follow a three-step approach: Assess, Mobilize, and Migrate, with a focus on cost-saving strategies, well-architected landing zones, and planning migration waves to optimize the process and minimize double-bubble costs.
