[### Measuring characteristics of TCP connections at Internet scale (12 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/measuring-network-connections-at-scale/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

TCP connections on the Internet are highly diverse, with most carrying very few packets and bytes while a small fraction handle massive volumes, creating a heavy-tailed distribution across packet counts, bytes sent, connection duration, and request counts. Metrics like packet ratios, path MTU, and initial congestion window reveal asymmetries and performance characteristics that influence throughput, latency, and efficiency across global networks.

[### StyleX: A Styling Library for CSS at Scale (8 minute read)](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/11/11/web/stylex-a-styling-library-for-css-at-scale/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Meta's StyleX, a styling system for large-scale applications, has become the standard across Meta products and external companies like Figma and Snowflake since being open-sourced in late 2023. By combining CSS-in-JS ergonomics with static CSS performance, StyleX generates collision-free atomic CSS while allowing expressive, type-safe style authoring, reducing CSS size by 80% at Meta.
