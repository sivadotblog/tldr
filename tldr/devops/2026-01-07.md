[### Change is the root of all (evil) bugs (3 minute read)](https://fhur.me/posts/2026/change-is-the-root-of-all-evil-bugs?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Bugs usually don't come from “bad code,” but from change—shifting dependencies, configurations, environments, assumptions, or system conditions that invalidate what once worked. Most good engineering practices exist to limit, isolate, or make change visible, because unmanaged change is what ultimately surprises and breaks systems.

[### AI and the ironies of automation (15 minute read)](https://www.ufried.com/blog/ironies_of_ai_2/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Lisanne Bainbridge's 1983 paper on automation ironies applies to AI agent supervision, revealing that effective human oversight requires better UI design, continuous training for rare interventions, and leadership skills to direct agent fleets. The paradox intensifies as AI agents improve because successful automation demands greater investment in human operator training and interface design to handle exceptional situations under time pressure.
