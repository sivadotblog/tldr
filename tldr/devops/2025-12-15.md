[### 10,000 Alerts. 50 Real Exposures. (Sponsor)](https://www.tenable.com/lp/campaigns/25/tenable-cloud-security-cs/?utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=00034581)

DevOps teams don't need more alerts. They need to know which ones matter.

[Tenable Cloud Security eliminates alert fatigue by prioritizing vulnerabilities](https://www.tenable.com/lp/campaigns/25/tenable-cloud-security-cs/?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=00034581) based on runtime data and active exploit paths.

Stop drowning in CVEs that don't matter. Get a prioritized list of your organization's highest-risk exposures.

We map risks across your entire hybrid stack – AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem Kubernetes – giving you a unified exposure graph.

Reduce your backlog, maintain high velocity, and fix the risks that actually matter.

### News & Trends

[### React2Shell and related RSC vulnerabilities threat brief- early exploitation activity and threat actor techniques (9 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/react2shell-rsc-vulnerabilities-exploitation-threat-brief/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Immediately following the public disclosure of React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182), a critical 10.0 CVSS remote code execution vulnerability in React Server Components, Cloudforce One observed widespread scanning and exploitation attempts, primarily from Asia-nexus threat groups. In response, Cloudflare deployed WAF rules that blocked over 582 million related hits by December 11 and offered protection against two additional RSC vulnerabilities.

[### 10 Platform engineering predictions for 2026 (4 minute read)](https://platformengineering.org/blog/10-platform-engineering-predictions-for-2026?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Platform engineering is predicted to transform from a competitive advantage to a fundamental requirement by 2026. The role is being fundamentally redefined by AI, security-by-design, and integrated FinOps. This shift will see AI agents become first-class platform citizens orchestrating subsystems and platforms serving as primary reviewers for AI-generated infrastructure code to ensure safety.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### What is a build system, anyway? (11 minute read)](https://jyn.dev/what-is-a-build-system-anyway/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Build systems execute dependency-tracked transformations from inputs to outputs, caching rule results so that only stale parts are recomputed during incremental builds while preserving correctness relative to a clean build. They revolve around rules and dependency graphs, track inputs to detect when outputs are outdated, and vary along dimensions like declared vs. traced dependencies, applicative vs. monadic graphs, inter- vs. intra-process execution, determinism and hermeticity, remote caching, and execution scheduling.

[### Stop writing if statements for your CLI flags (5 minute read)](https://hackers.pub/@hongminhee/2025/stop-writing-if-statements-for-your-cli-flags?utm_source=tldrdevops)

CLI option relationships should be expressed directly in the parser definition rather than enforced with runtime if checks. Encoding these constraints with value-based branching (such as Optique's conditional() pattern) makes the relationships part of the inferred TypeScript types, eliminating separate validation logic and catching errors at compile time.

### Miscellaneous

[### GRC Engineers: The Role DevOps Needs to Regain Balance (5 minute read)](https://arinco.com.au/blog/grc-engineers-the-role-devops-needs/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

DevOps often sidelined governance, leaving automation without accountability, and the emerging GRC Engineer role restores balance by embedding policy, compliance, and telemetry directly into CI/CD workflows. With tools like Azure Policy and GitHub-based enforcement already available, organizations succeed when engineers gain authority to codify governance and integrate it as core engineering work.

[### Visualizing Target Relabeling Rules in Prometheus 3.8.0 (2 minute read)](https://prometheus.io/blog/2025/12/02/visualizing-target-relabeling-rules-in-the-prometheus-ui/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Prometheus 3.8.0 adds a relabeling visualizer that displays each transformation applied to a discovered target's labels, highlighting changes and showing whether the target is kept or dropped. This stepwise view simplifies debugging and helps identify misconfigurations in relabeling rules.
