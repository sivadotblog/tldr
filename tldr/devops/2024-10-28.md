## Monitoring Kubernetes 🔍, Data Migration Systems 🔧, Framework Overload 🌐

[### Mobile could not be more different from backend. Why are you monitoring them in the same way? (Sponsor)](https://get.embrace.io/mobile-observability-guide/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=TLDR-mobile-observability-guide)

If you use the same observability approach for mobile apps as you would for servers and services, you'll have an incomplete (and often incorrect!) idea of your end users' experiences.

Get a [crash course on mobile app complexity](https://get.embrace.io/mobile-observability-guide/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=TLDR-mobile-observability-guide) — and why your existing observability approach might be limiting visibility, increasing toil, and preventing collaboration. This [guide by Embrace](https://get.embrace.io/mobile-observability-guide/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=TLDR-mobile-observability-guide) covers:

* Why you should focus on sessions, not transactions
* How device capabilities impact app performance
* Why backend metrics don't translate to mobile
* How data delays cause a misleading picture of app health
* Why client-side network monitoring is essential

[### Monitoring Kubernetes: Why traditional techniques aren't enough (12 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/10/18/monitoring-kubernetes-why-traditional-techniques-arent-enough/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This post contains a dialogue where experts discuss the importance of monitoring Kubernetes, covering performance metrics, logs, and debugging for large-scale deployments. Co-hosts from Grafana Labs and guests explore observability in cloud-native architectures, service meshes, and often overlooked costs of Kubernetes.

[### How Stripe architected massive scale observability solution on AWS (8 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/how-stripe-architected-massive-scale-observability-solution-on-aws/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Stripe faced scalability and cost challenges with its observability system and migrated to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) to address them. The migration process involved dual-writing metrics, translating alerts and dashboards, validating results, and educating users, which ultimately improved capacity, reduced costs, and enhanced alert execution.

[### Building a better and scalable system for data migrations (10 minute read)](https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/building-a-better-and-scalable-system-for-data-migrations/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Migration tools in frameworks like rwf lack scalability. Ideal migrations should handle changes bi-directionally, run against specific code versions, and split into pre- and post-deployment phases. Distributed processing for large migrations and better testing ensure reliability as systems grow.
