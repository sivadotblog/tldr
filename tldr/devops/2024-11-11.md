[### Regular Restarts Are Good, Actually (3 minute read)](https://matt.blwt.io/post/regular-restarts-are-good-actually/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Heroku's 24-hour dyno restarts, often misunderstood, help prevent memory leaks and align with Twelve-Factor App principles by enforcing stateless processes. This simplifies state coordination, scaling, and promotes idempotent, atomic, and reentrant task design. Long tasks should be broken down for easier retries, with rare exceptions for monolithic tasks like database dumps.
