[### What if you could automate reliability + chaos engineering? (Sponsor)](https://www.gremlin.com/blog/reliability-intelligence-your-reliability-expert?utm_source=tldr-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Reliability-Intelligence-Launch)

Chaos engineering tells you something broke. But figuring out what broke and how to fix it? That's where teams start scratching their heads (and spending thankless hours digging through telemetry).

[Gremlin's new Reliability Intelligence](https://www.gremlin.com/blog/reliability-intelligence-your-reliability-expert?utm_source=tldr-newsletter&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=Reliability-Intelligence-Launch) gives every team a built-in reliability expert, delivering faster insights and smarter fixes with every test.

So now you can:

* Connect your LLM through the Gremlin MCP server to query reliability data
* Apply 10+ years of chaos engineering expertise from Netflix and Amazon pioneers
* Auto-analyze experiments and get clear remediation steps
