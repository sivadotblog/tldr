### News & Trends

[### Announcing the end of support for Node.js 18.x in AWS CDK (4 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/announcing-the-end-of-support-for-node-js-18-x-in-aws-cdk/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AWS CDK will end support for Node.js 18.x on November 30 across all components because it reached its end of life on April 30. Users are encouraged to migrate to Node.js 22.x, the current Active Long Term Support version, to benefit from security patches, performance improvements, and modern Node.js capabilities.

[### Resource hooks (3 minute read)](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/resource-hooks/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Pulumi 3.179.0 introduces resource hooks, a much-requested feature that allows users to run arbitrary code at any point in Pulumi's resource lifecycle. Custom callbacks can be attached to create, update, and delete operations, enabling custom behavior before or after they occur, such as setting up an SSH tunnel or sending metrics to a data warehouse. Resource hooks were also added to a guide for creating an EC2 web server to health check the web server before the Pulumi deployment was marked as complete.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### How we replaced the default K8s scheduler to optimize our Continuous Integration builds (10 minute read)](https://codefresh.io/blog/custom-k8s-scheduler-continuous-integration/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Codefresh replaced the default Kubernetes scheduler with a custom scheduler tailored for ephemeral CI/CD workloads to minimize build start latency and optimize resource usage. It introduced "ballast" pods with low priority to ensure real build pods start immediately and implemented a scheduler plugin that packs jobs tightly on nodes, improving cluster utilization and reducing costs.

[### How to restore a container image from an Azure Kubernetes Service node to an Azure Container Registry? (3 minute read)](https://www.danielstechblog.io/how-to-restore-a-container-image-from-an-azure-kubernetes-service-node-to-an-azure-container-registry/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A deleted container image version can be restored from a running pod on an Azure Kubernetes Service node by using the containerd CLI with Azure CLI's run-command to push the image back to Azure Container Registry. This process involves listing images on the node, verifying the target image exists, and then pushing it to the registry without needing direct SSH access to the node.

[### Setting up a local Langfuse server with Kubernetes to trace Agentic systems (2 minute read)](https://xebia.com/blog/setting-up-local-langfuse-server/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

For developing sensitive LLM applications, a local GPU cluster can be set up with a self-hosted Langfuse server using tools like Helm Chart and Kubernetes. Configuration details include creating a namespace with a namespace.yml file, setting mandatory secrets with kubernetes-secret-generator in a secrets.yml file, and configuring ingress with Traefik to allow local traffic to reach the Langfuse server.

[### Azure DevOps: pull requests and dynamic required reviewers (11 minute read)](https://johnnyreilly.com/azure-devops-pull-requests-dynamic-required-reviewers?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Azure DevOps supports setting required reviewers for pull requests through branch policies, but these reviewers are static and do not change dynamically. By leveraging build validation pipelines that can dynamically add required reviewers and fail the build until approvals are given, it is possible to enforce flexible, dynamic review requirements, though the pipeline must be manually rerun after approvals.

[### Running high-performance PostgreSQL on Azure Kubernetes Service (5 minute read)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/running-high-performance-postgresql-on-azure-kubernetes-service/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

PostgreSQL now powers 36% of database workloads on Kubernetes, with Azure Kubernetes Service offering two main storage options: local NVMe for ultra-low latency and high throughput, and Premium SSD v2 for flexible, cost-efficient scaling. The CloudNativePG operator enables high availability with automated failover and backups, making AKS a robust platform for performance-critical, stateful PostgreSQL deployments.

[### Test Driven Development (TDD) with dbt: Test First, SQL Later (11 minute read)](https://xebia.com/blog/test-driven-development-tdd-with-dbt/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Analytics engineers can improve data model quality by using Test-Driven Development (TDD) in dbt. TDD involves writing tests that define "good data" before building the model, which helps catch problems early and ensures more reliable, maintainable data models. dbt's unit testing feature enables a test-driven workflow, with different tests designed to validate data row-by-row, logic, and model outputs.
