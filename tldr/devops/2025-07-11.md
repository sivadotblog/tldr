[### Docker Brings Compose to the Agent Era: Building AI Agents is Now Easy (5 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/build-ai-agents-with-docker-compose/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Docker has evolved to support agentic applications, offering tools to build, ship, and run agents more easily. The updated Docker Compose allows developers to define open models, agents, and MCP-compatible tools in a single YAML file, while Docker Offload enables running models on cloud GPUs, with 300 minutes of free usage being offered. New integrations with Google Cloud Run and Microsoft Azure Container Apps Service also allow for seamless production deployment of agentic apps.

[### Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY does not scale (7 minute read)](https://www.recall.ai/blog/postgres-listen-notify-does-not-scale?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Postgres' LISTEN/NOTIFY feature causes severe performance bottlenecks under high concurrency by acquiring a global lock during transaction commits, effectively serializing all commits. Replacing LISTEN/NOTIFY with application-layer logic eliminates the lock contention and restores full database performance.

[### Is Fewer Incidents Always Good? (3 minute read)](https://uptimelabs.io/is-fewer-incidents-always-good/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Technology teams often aim to reduce incidents, but pursuing zero incidents is unrealistic and can harm organizational resilience. Incident counts alone are misleading metrics that may suppress valuable learning opportunities, and setting targets tied to incident reduction risks incentivizing underreporting rather than true improvement.

[### eBPF Has a Bright Future in Infrastructure Development (3 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/ebpf-has-a-bright-future-in-infrastructure-development/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

eBPF is accelerating kernel innovation by enabling developers to safely insert custom logic into the Linux kernel, improving performance, policy enforcement, and observability across infrastructure. It is being widely adopted in networking, virtual machines, process scheduling, and AI systems by companies like Meta and Google, with future potential for live kernel patching and platform unification.
