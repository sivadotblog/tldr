[### Platform Engineering on Kubernetes: An Open Source-First Approach (Sponsor)](https://chronosphere.io/resource/platform-engineering-on-kubernetes/?utm_source=tldr-devops&amp;utm_medium=newsletter)

An internal developer platform can be a productivity multiplier and give developers flexibility in their infrastructure choices ‚Äî but first, you need to make the right choices when it comes to building blocks.

The Manning book [Platform Engineering on Kubernetes](https://chronosphere.io/resource/platform-engineering-on-kubernetes/?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_medium=newsletter) takes an in-depth look at the latest best practices and open source tools from the Kubernetes community. Use it as a sort of [IKEA manual to build an open developer platform](https://chronosphere.io/resource/platform-engineering-on-kubernetes/?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_medium=newsletter), including:

* Multi-cloud infrastructure management with Crossplane
* Using Dapr for standard API distribution
* Implementing feature flags with OpenFeature

[### Two Simple Rules to Fix Code Reviews (3 minute read)](https://serce.me/posts/2025-07-17-two-simple-rules-to-fix-code-reviews?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Code reviews are significantly more effective when two key rules are followed: respond as quickly as possible to minimize context loss and delays, and include a clear "because" in every comment to communicate intent and reduce back-and-forth. Consistently applying these practices sets a strong team culture and shortens development cycles by keeping work unblocked and feedback actionable.
