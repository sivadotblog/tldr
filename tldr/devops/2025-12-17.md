[### Devs are confident about release stability... but 1 in 4 ends in downtime (Sponsor)](https://chronosphere.io/resource/unveiling-the-landscape-of-day-1-release-readiness-in-cloud-native-ci-cd/?utm_source=tldr-devops&amp;utm_medium=newsletter)

According to a recent [Google Cloud + Chronosphere report](https://chronosphere.io/resource/unveiling-the-landscape-of-day-1-release-readiness-in-cloud-native-ci-cd/?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_medium=newsletter):

* 59% of orgs feel “very confident” in production readinesses, but almost 25% encounter downtime during releases.
* >92% monitor apps frequently or continuously, but many still report limited visibility.

Find out what's going wrong (and right) by grabbing a copy of [Unveiling the Landscape of Day 1: Release Readiness in Cloud-Native CI/CD](https://chronosphere.io/resource/unveiling-the-landscape-of-day-1-release-readiness-in-cloud-native-ci-cd/?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_medium=newsletter). This report looks at recent survey data to show how orgs are preparing for day 1 -- with practical advice on how to prepare your apps, infrastructure, and processes for Day 1 success.

[### CoreDNS-1.13.2 Release (2 minute read)](https://coredns.io/2025/12/08/coredns-1.13.2-release/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The new CoreDNS release introduces initial DoH3 support, core performance and stability fixes, and plugin improvements across forwarding, GeoIP, cache, and orchestration integrations. GeoIP has deprecated returning 0,0 for missing coordinates, switching to empty values in the next release.

[### Meet exe.dev, modern VMs (2 minute read)](https://blog.exe.dev/meet-exe.dev?utm_source=tldrdevops)

exe.dev is launching a public developer preview of a VM hosting service that lets users spin up many real, fast-starting Ubuntu VMs via an SSH-based API, sharing a fixed CPU/RAM budget across as many VMs as they want. The platform focuses on private-by-default, persistent, agent-friendly VMs with sub-second startup and no per-VM marginal cost, aiming to make running lots of small tools and agents frictionless.

[### Building platforms using kro for composition (6 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/12/15/building-platforms-using-kro-for-composition/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The Kube Resource Orchestrator (kro) has been integrated into Amazon's new EKS capabilities, signaling major cloud provider recognition of its potential to simplify Kubernetes-native resource grouping for platform engineers. The powerful mechanism abstracts complex Kubernetes objects through ResourceGraphDefinitions, enhancing composition while integrating with broader orchestration frameworks.

[### Machine Learning Engineering: Complete Guide to Building Production ML Systems (13 minute read)](https://www.databricks.com/blog/machine-learning-engineering-complete-guide-building-production-ml-systems?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) has emerged as a critical and highly lucrative field, serving as the essential bridge between data science research and the deployment of production-grade artificial intelligence systems at scale. This in-demand role requires a diverse skill set encompassing programming, ML algorithms, and data engineering, all guided by a proven methodology to ensure successful and maintainable solutions.

[### System Observability: Metrics, Sampling, and Tracing (6 minute read)](https://entropicthoughts.com/system-observability-metrics-sampling-tracing?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Whole-system observability using metrics and sampling is cheap and effective for capacity planning and fault detection, but it cannot explain what happens inside individual operations. Per-process tracing provides exact timelines needed to identify and prioritize the highest-ROI optimizations, and can be implemented efficiently using techniques like leveraging early-exit syscall paths to correlate application events with system traces.
