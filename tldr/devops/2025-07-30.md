[### How Datadog Cloud Network Monitoring helps you move to a deny-by-default network egress policy at scale (12 minute read)](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/cnm-kubernetes-egress/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Organizations often begin with permissive egress policies in Kubernetes to ensure agility, but must later shift to a deny-by-default model to enhance security. Datadog Cloud Network Monitoring enables safe policy transitions by identifying which Kubernetes namespaces require internet access and guiding the creation of precise egress controls using tools like Cilium or AWS VPC CNI.

[### AWS AgentCore: The Overlooked Privilege Escalation Path in Bedrock's AI Tooling (6 minute read)](https://sonraisecurity.com/blog/aws-agentcore-privilege-escalation-bedrock-scp-fix/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A recent investigation revealed that AWS Bedrock AgentCore Code Interpreters, intended to enhance AI agent capabilities, can be exploited to escalate privileges by gaining access to new IAM roles. By directly invoking Code Interpreters and instructing them to perform control plane actions, unauthorized individuals can effectively assume the execution roles associated with those interpreters, especially since AWS does not support resource policies in any part of Bedrock AgentCore.
