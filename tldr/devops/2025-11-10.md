[### AI's 70% Problem (4 minute read)](https://zed.dev/blog/ai-70-problem-addy-osmani?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AI coding tools can produce about 70% of a solution quickly, but the remaining 30%—covering edge cases, debugging, production integration, and security—still demands human expertise. Despite growing adoption, trust in AI-generated code is declining. Developers need to prioritize human understanding, code review, and accountability as automation shifts bottlenecks from writing code to reviewing it.

[### Terraform vs. Pulumi vs. Crossplane: Choosing the right IaC Tool for your platform (8 minute read)](https://platformengineering.org/blog/terraform-vs-pulumi-vs-crossplane-iac-tool?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Terraform, Pulumi, and Crossplane are Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools for managing cloud infrastructure. Terraform uses HCL, Pulumi leverages programming languages, and Crossplane utilizes Kubernetes for continuous reconciliation. Terraform is best for multi-cloud management and CI/CD workflows, Pulumi for dynamic infrastructure and software engineering practices, and Crossplane for developer self-service platforms. Polyglot IaC strategies are being adopted to align each tool's strengths with distinct infrastructure layers.

[### Unlocking self-service LLM deployment with platform engineering (4 minute read)](https://platformengineering.org/blog/unlocking-self-service-llm-deployment-with-platform-engineering?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Platform engineering is critical for scaling generative AI and moving beyond MLOps bottlenecks, enabling a robust, self-service model for developers. Organizations can abstract away the complexities of LLM infrastructure by building a standardized Internal Developer Platform (IDP), creating a "paved road" that enables a true self-service model for deploying, managing, and scaling models securely and efficiently. HCP Terraform, GitHub Actions, and Port are tools that create a clear separation of concerns and a seamless experience in deploying LLM on Microsoft Azure.
