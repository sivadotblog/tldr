You've been there: code's ready to ship, everyone's excited—then someone spots a vulnerability. Suddenly it's an all-hands emergency and time to cancel your evening plans.

[Microsoft Azure](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/G37nHF) bakes security in from the start. [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/G37nHF) helps keep your apps and code protected throughout the development lifecycle. Less last-minute surprises, more peace of mind.

Ship fast. Ship safely. Do both at the same time.
