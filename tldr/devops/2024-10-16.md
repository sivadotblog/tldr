Log data has surged by 250% in just the past year. With sources multiplying, formats diversifying, and the number of destinations increasing, managing this data is becoming frustratingly expensive and complex.

In this recorded session, Chronosphere's experts show [how to use a Telemetry Pipeline](https://chronosphere.io/resource/how-to-transform-your-logs-to-meet-your-observability-and-security-needs/?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_medium=newsletter) to make log data management more manageable ‚Äî including:

* Common processing rules and how to apply them to your log data.
* Best practices for excluding noisy logs from your observability and SIEM tools.
* How to pre-process data in different ways based on where it's being routed.
* Converting noisy logs to metrics for faster alerting
