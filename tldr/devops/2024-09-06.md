[### The 5-step practical guide to migrating your observability platform (Sponsor)](https://chronosphere.io/resource/observability-platform-migration-5-step-practical-guide-to-upgrading-your-observability/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=tldr-devops)

Migrating to a new observability platform is a major project that impacts people, processes, and technology.

Many organizations would prefer to postpone migration indefinitely ‚Äî but getting stuck with incumbent tooling inevitably leads to higher costs, increased developer toil, and unhappy end users.

To make your migration journey less painful, [Chronosphere has prepared a handy guide](https://chronosphere.io/resource/observability-platform-migration-5-step-practical-guide-to-upgrading-your-observability/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-devops) outlining the important factors to look out for across the 5 steps of the migration process: prepare ‚Üí design ‚Üí implement ‚Üí test ‚Üí adopt.

Take a few minutes to read through the guide and you'll [avoid unforced errors](https://chronosphere.io/resource/observability-platform-migration-5-step-practical-guide-to-upgrading-your-observability/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-devops) when migrating to new observability.

[### Containerising Azure Functions without Dockerfile (8 minute read)](https://devkimchi.com/2024/08/23/containerising-azure-functions-without-dockerfile/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This article explains how to containerize Azure Functions apps for .NET using two methods: with a Dockerfile and via MSBuild's native containerization support. It provides detailed steps for both approaches, allowing developers to build and run containerized Azure Functions apps locally.

[### Creating A Git Commit The Hard Way (8 minute read)](https://avestura.dev/blog/creating-a-git-commit-the-hard-way?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This article dives deep into what creating a git commit with the canonical git commit command actually does under the hood. It walks through the underlying git operations that are executed to get it to work.

[### "SRE" doesn't seem to mean anything useful any more (4 minute read)](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/09/03/ops/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This author, frustrated by being stereotyped as merely a "devops" worker due to their Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) background, recounts a pivotal decision at Torq to use gRPC and Protobuf instead of OpenAPI/Swagger. This choice, influenced by past negative experiences at Luminate Security, led to improved system compatibility and coding standards. Despite the success, they feel their broader technical skills are often overlooked.

[### Leaked Environment Variables Allow Large-Scale Extortion Operation of Cloud Environments (18 minute read)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/large-scale-cloud-extortion-operation?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This article reveals a cloud extortion operation exploiting overly permissive IAM credentials and exposed environment (.env) files to ransom organizations' cloud data. The attackers gained initial access by scanning the internet for exposed .env files containing sensitive authentication data, which could have been prevented by following cloud security best practices.

[### AWS IAM: A Comprehensive Guide Toward Least Privilege (9 minute read)](https://cyscale.com/blog/aws-iam-least-privilege?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This article emphasizes the importance of applying the principle of least privilege (PoLP) in cloud environments to reduce the risks of credential theft, accidental or intentional data deletion, and other security incidents. It suggests starting with broader permissions and gradually narrowing them while considering the use of more restrictive policies like ViewOnlyAccess or SecurityAudit instead of ReadOnlyAccess for production environments.
