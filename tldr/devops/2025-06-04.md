[### Migrating Uber's Compute Platform to Kubernetes: A Technical Journey (10 minute read)](https://www.uber.com/en-AU/blog/migrating-ubers-compute-platform-to-kubernetes-a-technical-journey/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Uber migrated all shared stateless workloads from Mesos to Kubernetes to leverage industry-standard tooling, improve scalability, and ensure infrastructure resilience. The transition was completed by mid-2024. It required overcoming large-scale operational challenges, rebuilding ecosystem integrations, achieving feature parity, and implementing custom solutions like artifact preservation, gradual scaling, and faster rollback mechanisms.

[### Building Industrial Strength Software without Unit Tests (8 minute read)](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/transcript-tests?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Unit tests can be cumbersome and unnecessary for certain projects. Developers should instead use transcript tests, which are deterministic, markdown-based integration tests that interact with a system's external interface and can double as documentation and bug reports. Unison successfully used this approach by scripting full workflows and capturing outputs, proving it to be a maintainable and developer-friendly alternative to traditional testing practices.

### Miscellaneous

[### Tests should not contain logic (2 minute read)](https://blog.snork.dev/posts/tests-should-not-contain-logic.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Tests should avoid logic to prevent masking bugs in the code under test‚Äîduplicating the same flawed logic in a test will lead to false positives. Use parametrized tests instead to concisely cover multiple cases with explicit inputs and expected outputs, ensuring clarity and correctness without control flow in the test itself.

[### Cloud Realities Are Slowing AI Ambitions (4 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-realities-are-slowing-ai-ambitions/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AI workloads, especially with the rise of Agentic AI, are straining traditional cloud configurations, requiring enterprises to re-architect systems for greater interactivity, lower latency, and resilience. To maintain performance, businesses must reassess cloud infrastructure, traffic routing, and service dependencies to meet the demands of AI at scale.
