[### Kubernetes v1.34: PSI Metrics for Kubernetes Graduates to Beta (2 minute read)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/04/kubernetes-v1-34-introducing-psi-metrics-beta/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes v1.34 has graduated Pressure Stall Information (PSI) Metrics to Beta, offering a way to quantify resource pressure on nodes. Collected by the kubelet with the KubeletPSI feature gate enabled, PSI metrics expose data from the Linux kernel via the Summary API and the /metrics/cadvisor Prometheus endpoint to monitor CPU, memory, and I/O pressure at the node, pod, and container level.

[### Introducing Apache Kafka® 4.1.0: What's New and How to Upgrade (6 minute read)](https://www.confluent.io/blog/introducing-apache-kafka-4-1/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Apache Kafka 4.1.0 introduces major updates, including the preview of Queues for Kafka (KIP-932), early access to the new Streams Rebalance Protocol (KIP-1071), consistent error handling for transactions, expanded OAuth support, and deadlock protection in producers. It also adds improvements across Streams and Connect, like explicit naming for internal topics and support for running multiple connector versions, making the platform more robust, scalable, and easier to manage.

[### From Symptoms to Solutions: Reducing MTTR through error analysis in New Relic (10 minute read)](https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/from-symptoms-to-solutions-reducing-mttr-through-error-analysis-in-new-relic?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Modern outages cost businesses up to $23,750 per minute, but structured error analysis with observability reduces downtime by turning noisy alerts into root cause insights. Teams can correlate symptoms, signals, logs, traces, and change events in one workflow, cutting MTTR and enabling faster, more reliable remediation.

[### Tiger teams: How we tackle urgent, cross-functional challenges at Grafana Labs (8 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/09/05/tiger-teams-how-we-tackle-urgent-cross-functional-challenges-at-grafana-labs/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana Labs successfully used "tiger teams" – small, focused groups of specialists – to address high-priority, cross-functional problems, improving release cycles and tackling urgent issues. Originating from NASA's Apollo 13 mission, these teams at Grafana Labs consist of three to five specialized engineers who work temporarily, typically for one to two quarters, until a specific goal is achieved, such as simplifying the release process or securing a major partnership. The success of the Release Tiger Team led to the creation of a full-time dedicated team to iterate on release issues, though tiger teams can also be dissolved once their objectives have been met.

[### Understanding dbt: basics and best practices (5 minute read)](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/understanding-dbt/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Data Build Tool (dbt) is an open-source analytics engineering framework that allows teams to transform raw data in warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery using SQL-based workflows. Available as dbt Core (free CLI tool) and dbt Cloud (managed platform), dbt introduces software engineering best practices such as version control, automated testing, and CI/CD to analytics workflows. OpenLineage integration allows users to capture dbt job details, such as start and end times, to proactively alert and perform root cause analysis.

Dapr abstracts distributed system complexity while Argo CD enforces GitOps workflows, enabling consistent, automated, and self-service microservice deployments on Kubernetes. Together, they reduce operational overhead, prevent drift, and provide a scalable foundation for secure and reliable cloud-native applications.

[### Broadcom's New Bitnami Restrictions? Migrate Easily with Docker (5 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/broadcoms-new-bitnami-restrictions-migrate-easily-with-docker/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Broadcom is moving most Bitnami images behind a paid subscription, leaving only \:latest tags free and shifting older images into an unsupported legacy registry, which raises cost, stability, and compliance risks for teams. Docker's Official Images and Hardened Images are free and enterprise-ready alternatives that offer security, stability, and predictable pricing for organizations needing reliable container solutions.
