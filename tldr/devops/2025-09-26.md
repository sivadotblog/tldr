[### Multitenant managed logging in Container insights (15 minute read)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-nz/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-multitenant?tabs=arm&amp;utm_source=tldrdevops)

Multitenant logging in Container insights enables AKS operators to route container logs from different Kubernetes namespaces to separate Log Analytics workspaces, supporting both multitenancy and multihoming scenarios. The feature relies on ContainerLogV2Extension data collection rules, ConfigMap configuration, and high-scale logging, providing teams with isolated access to logs, compliance, and cost management while allowing centralized infrastructure monitoring.

[### Implementing Automated Resource Tagging Across AWS Organizations (7 minute read)](https://faun.pub/implementing-automated-resource-tagging-across-aws-organizations-247e70d384ae?utm_source=tldrdevops)

An automated tagging solution using CloudFormation, Lambda, and AWS Config ensures consistent resource tags across AWS Organizations by propagating organizational unit tags, enforcing compliance, and reducing manual management overhead. The implementation, deployed through multi-region CloudFormation templates with cross-account roles and StackSets, has been tested in production and delivers improvements in governance, compliance, efficiency, and cost tracking.

[### R2 SQL: a deep dive into our new distributed query engine (13 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/r2-sql-deep-dive/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare has launched R2 SQL, a serverless query engine that enables users to run SQL queries over petabytes of data stored in R2 Data Catalog, a managed Apache Iceberg catalog built directly into Cloudflare R2 buckets. R2 SQL addresses I/O and compute challenges by using a Query Planner that intelligently prunes the search space and a Query Execution system that distributes work across Cloudflare's global network for massively parallel execution. The new service is currently available in open beta.

[### Queues, Buses, and Streams (6 minute read)](https://sethorell.substack.com/p/queues-buses-and-streams?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AWS messaging services can be grouped into queues, buses, and streams, each optimized for different patterns of data movement. SQS provides pull-based queuing with new fair queueing features, SNS and EventBridge enable push-based fan-out and event-driven architectures, while Kinesis and MSK support high-volume streaming use cases where relationships between data elements matter.

[### Zalando Engineering Blog - Dead Ends or Data Goldmines? Investment Insights from Two Years of AI-Powered Postmortem Analysis (13 minute read)](https://engineering.zalando.com/posts/2025/09/dead-ends-or-data-goldmines-ai-powered-postmortem-analysis.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Zalando adopted a large language model as an intelligent Site Reliability Engineering assistant to analyze thousands of postmortems, which helped automate the identification of recurring incident patterns in datastores like Postgres, AWS DynamoDB, and Elasticsearch. The AI-powered system reduced analysis time from days to hours and helped identify hidden hotspots, but human curation remained essential for accuracy and addressing limitations like hallucinations. This system has led to solutions like automated change validation for infrastructure as code, which has shielded Zalando from 25% of subsequent datastore incidents.
