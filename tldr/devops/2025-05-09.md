Software development is undergoing a significant shift. Instead of writing every line by hand, engineers can work with agents capable of executing complex tasks.

Unlocking this potential requires a new mental model—one where developers stop ‘thinking by writing code' and start behaving as software conductors.

[Check out our guide](https://gitpod.io/blog/software-conductors-handbook?utm_campaign=tldrdevops_2025_primary_2&utm_source=partner&utm_medium=email) to becoming a software conductor and learn:

* Why top-performing engineers spend more time planning
* Why isolated environments enable secure agent parallelization
* How to create "agent PRDs" to increase AI autonomy
