[### No, AI is not Making Engineers 10x as Productive (13 minute read)](https://colton.dev/blog/curing-your-ai-10x-engineer-imposter-syndrome/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Claims that AI is making engineers 10‚Äì100x more productive are exaggerated and mathematically implausible when considering real-world software development processes, bottlenecks, and human workflows. While AI tools can offer occasional bursts of efficiency, especially for boilerplate or one-off tasks, they do not fundamentally change the collaborative, thoughtful, and iterative nature of engineering work. It's okay to prioritize enjoyment and quality over marginal speed gains.
