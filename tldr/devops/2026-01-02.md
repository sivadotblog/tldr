Cloudflare Radar 2025 reported 19% internet traffic growth, Googlebot dominance, aggressive AI crawling with extreme crawl-to-refer ratios, post-quantum encryption securing about half of human web traffic, and Go-based API clients exceeding 20% adoption.

[### 2025: The year in LLMs (28 minute read)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

2025 was defined by reasoning-driven models and practical agents—especially coding agents and CLI workflows—unlocking longer autonomous tasks and widespread prompt-based image editing, while raising new safety risks around YOLO usage, AI browsers, and prompt injection. Meanwhile, Chinese open-weight models surged, OpenAI's lead narrowed as Gemini advanced, cloud models pulled ahead of local ones, AI “slop” went mainstream, and data centers drew increasing backlash.
