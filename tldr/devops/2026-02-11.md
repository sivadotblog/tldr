[### 75% of GPUs are sitting idle. Are yours? (Sponsor)](https://www.qovery.com/?utm_campaign=331441397-Paid%20-%20TLDR%20NL%20-%20Kubernetes%20positioning&amp;utm_source=TLDR%20newsletter-Devops&amp;utm_term=Kuebrnetes%20positioning&amp;utm_content=Devops%20issue)

The harsh truth is that most K8s Ops teams are wasting their most expensive resources:

* 80% of DevOps time wasted on “Day 2” tasks like upgrades, patching, and custom scripts.
* 75% of GPUs sit idle due to static allocation and poor scheduling.
* H100s can take 52 weeks to deploy, yet sit unused while teams write YAML.
