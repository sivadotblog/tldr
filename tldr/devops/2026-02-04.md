[### Amazon EKS and Amazon EKS Distro now supports Kubernetes version 1.35 (2 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2026/01/amazon-eks-distro-kubernetes-version-1-35/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Amazon EKS and EKS Distro now support Kubernetes 1.35, enabling new cluster creation and upgrades across all regions. The release adds in-place pod resource updates, improved traffic locality, topology labels via Downward API, and image volumes for delivering data artifacts.

[### Introducing Node Readiness Controller (2 minute read)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/02/03/introducing-node-readiness-controller/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The Kubernetes project introduced the Node Readiness Controller, a declarative system designed to ensure nodes meet all complex infrastructure dependencies, like GPU drivers or network agents, beyond the standard "Ready" condition before pods are scheduled. This controller dynamically manages taints based on custom health signals, allowing operators to define specific readiness requirements across heterogeneous clusters.

[### Securing GPU-accelerated AI workloads in Oracle Kubernetes Engine (5 minute read)](https://www.sysdig.com/blog/securing-gpu-accelerated-ai-workloads-in-oracle-kubernetes-engine?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A rapidly evolving threat landscape, marked by sophisticated supply-chain compromises and runtime exploits, has emerged for AI and ML workloads increasingly deployed on cloud infrastructure like Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE). To counter this, Sysdig developed a CNAPP platform that offers real-time detection and posture management, integrating with OCI Kubernetes blueprints to enable secure-by-default GPU-accelerated AI deployments.

[### Forget technical debt (14 minute read)](https://www.ufried.com/blog/forget_technical_debt/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Technical debt is only one small contributor to increased cognitive load, which ultimately causes higher development effort and poorer runtime stability. Focusing narrowly on technical debt misses larger, often more damaging drivers—such as wasteful requirements, stress, process complexity, and organizational choices—so real improvement requires a broader, more holistic approach.
