Everyone recognizes DevOps as the modern standard, but is everyone actually integrating and automating development? That depends on their tooling AND their culture.

The [Forrester Wave DevOps Platforms](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/6Ifa03) report for Q2 2025 looks at what matters most in a modern DevOps platform. [Read it free](https://links.tldrnewsletter.com/6Ifa03) to see how the top 11 vendors compare on use cases such as:

* Streamlining dev from idea to deployment with agentic AI
* Improving software quality and engineering standards
* Unifying incident, change, and release management to accelerate innovation

### News & Trends

[### Announcing Rust 1.93.0 (2 minute read)](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2026/01/22/Rust-1.93.0/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Rust 1.93.0 updates bundled musl to 1.2.5 for more reliable static Linux networking builds (with a long-prepared breaking change), allows Rust global allocators to safely use thread-local storage, and improves inline assembly with per-line cfg support. The release also stabilizes a large set of low-level and utility APIs (e.g., MaybeUninit, raw parts for String/Vec, unchecked integer ops, slice-to-array helpers, and formatting helpers) alongside standard Cargo and Clippy updates.

[### Results from the 2025 Go Developer Survey (17 minute read)](https://go.dev/blog/survey2025?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Go remains extremely well-liked (91% satisfied), but developers want clearer best-practice guidance, better discoverability of high-quality modules, and improvements to core tooling like go command help. AI tools are widely used for learning and boilerplate, yet satisfaction is lukewarm due to code quality issues, while most Go work still centers on CLIs and APIs, with a noticeable pullback from AI features in production.

[### CloudBees CEO: Why Migration Is a Mirage Costing You Millions (3 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/cloudbees-ceo-why-migration-is-a-mirage-costing-you-millions/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A CloudBees survey found enterprises overspend on migration with frequent overruns, arguing modernization is wrongly equated with migration, which drains budgets and morale, undervalues resilient legacy systems, and diverts teams from delivering customer value.

[### How Binary Dependencies Work Across Different Languages (13 minute read)](https://vlad.website/how-binary-dependencies-work/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Precompiled binary libraries can be called from higher-level languages through three main approaches: dynamic linking, dynamic loading via FFI, and dynamic linking using extension modules. These techniques differ in when symbol resolution happens and how data is converted, with extension modules offering the best performance and flexibility at the cost of more complex native code.

[### How We Scaled Code Repository Management at DNSimple (9 minute read)](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2025/11/managing-repositories-terraform-github/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

DNSimple automated GitHub repository management by replacing manual scripts with Terraform-based IaC, using CI/CD workflows and Terraform Cloud to enforce consistent settings, templates, permissions, and ownership with full visibility, code review, and scalable bulk updates.

[### Compiling Scheme to WebAssembly (5 minute read)](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2026/compiling-scheme-to-webassembly/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The Bob Scheme project was extended with a new compiler that lowers full Scheme directly to WebAssembly, using the WASM GC extension to support closures, cons cells, symbols, and garbage collection. The work highlights practical design choices—GC-managed structs, unboxed integers, manual string handling in linear memory, and core builtins like write implemented in raw WASM text—showing how a real high-level language can target WASM.

GEICO cut its $300M cloud spend and improved reliability by shifting from network-centric security to identity-based controls, standardizing secrets with HashiCorp Vault, simplifying infrastructure, boosting portability, and building a scalable foundation for AI-driven modernization.

[### The Bus Factor (6 minute read)](https://mclare.blog/posts/the-bus-factor/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A 2016 bus-factor analysis was rerun on major open-source repositories using 2024 data, showing most projects haven't improved knowledge distribution, with some (like Linux) declining sharply. Surprising results from GitHub Linguist filtering reveal weaknesses in authorship-only metrics and point to the need for richer signals like reviews and shared ownership.
