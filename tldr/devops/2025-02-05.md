[### Using custom Org Policies to enforce the CIS benchmark for GKE (4 minute read)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-to-use-custom-org-policies-to-enforce-cis-benchmark-for-gke/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This post explains how custom Organization Policies can be used to enforce the CIS Benchmark for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to enhance security and compliance. It highlights the use of a policy library to simplify the adoption of security best practices across Google Cloud services.

[### How Precision Time Protocol handles leap seconds (4 minute read)](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/02/03/production-engineering/how-precision-time-protocol-ptp-handles-leap-seconds/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Meta advocates for the elimination of leap seconds due to their disruptive impact on precision time protocols like PTP, suggesting that stopping new leap seconds after 2035 would simplify infrastructure and enhance timekeeping precision. At Meta, leap second smearing is managed through different algorithms for NTP and PTP, with the latter using a stateless approach to time adjustments. The company recommends a shift to TAI over UTC to reduce time discrepancies during synchronization.

[### Boost your ADF productivity with Terraform (9 minute read)](https://xebia.com/blog/speed-up-adf-development-using-terraform/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This blog post demonstrates how Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Terraform can enhance data ingestion by utilizing parameters and Terraform-based triggers, reducing development time and allowing non-technical users to contribute more effectively. The proposed method emphasizes code reusability and simplicity, addressing inefficiencies in ADF's click-based development by applying software development practices like DRY and KISS, leading to a more consistent and easily managed infrastructure across various environments.

[### How Languages Influence Each Other And Evolve (9 minute read)](https://thetechenabler.substack.com/p/how-languages-influence-each-other?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Programming languages borrow and evolve ideas from one another, with list comprehensions being a prime example. List comprehensions originated from set theory and became popular through Haskell. It later influenced Python, C#, and others, while some languages like JavaScript and Java opted for function chaining instead. This reflects a broader principle in language design: new features must balance usefulness, complexity, and maintainability, influencing not just programming languages but also API and product design.

[### ByteDance to Network a Million Containers with netkit (3 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/bytedance-to-network-a-million-containers-with-netkit/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

ByteDance is adopting netkit, an eBPF-based alternative to Virtual Ethernet, to improve container networking performance by 10% while reducing CPU usage. Despite running an older Linux kernel, the company has backported netkit and begun deploying it across clusters with minimal issues.

[### Let's talk about AI and end-to-end encryption (12 minute read)](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/01/17/lets-talk-about-ai-and-end-to-end-encryption/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A recent paper by NYU and Cornell researchers examined the intersection of end-to-end encryption and AI, highlighting privacy concerns as AI integration with mobile devices requires more data processing on remote servers. This article discusses the potential erosion of privacy rights due to AI's growing need for access to vast amounts of personal data, with companies like Apple attempting to mitigate risks through "Private Cloud Compute," although that remains less secure compared to end-to-end encryption.
