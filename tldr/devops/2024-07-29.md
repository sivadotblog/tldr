What does “good” look like for engineering teams?

Your best benchmark is your own baseline. But if you're interested in quickly identifying opportunities for improvement, start with [Swarmia's engineering benchmarks](https://www.swarmia.com/benchmarks/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=email&utm_medium=cpv&utm_content=july24).

These benchmarks are based on conversations and metrics from [thousands of companies](https://www.swarmia.com/benchmarks/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=email&utm_medium=cpv&utm_content=july24), ranging from small startups to enterprises with tens of thousands of employees. The focus is on [measurable metrics with proven impact](https://www.swarmia.com/benchmarks/?utm_campaign=TLDR&utm_source=email&utm_medium=cpv&utm_content=july24), such as:

* Batch size (good: <500 lines, great: <200 lines)
* Lead time to change (good: <3 working days, great: <24 hours)
* Time to deploy (good: <30 minutes, great: <15 minutes)
