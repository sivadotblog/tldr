[### Hands-on workshop series: from zero to IDP (Sponsor)](https://hubs.ly/Q03x7NMw0)

Building an Internal Developer Platform takes more than tools. It requires clear strategy, secure guardrails, and scalable infrastructure practices that balance developer autonomy with operational control.

Pulumi's free [IDP Builder Series](https://hubs.ly/Q03x7NMw0) will cover these topics in hands-on workshops, [starting July 30](https://hubs.ly/Q03x7NMw0). Over the course of 3 x 120 minutes sessions, you'l learn how to:

* Design IDP strategy and golden path templates
* Secure platforms with policy as code and drift remediation
* Scale to support AI workloads and integrate existing Terraform

Workshops are led by Pulumi experts who've built production-ready IDPs and include live demos, code examples, and implementation guides.

[### From Async/Await to Virtual Threads (7 minute read)](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/7/26/virtual-threads/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Async/await exposed more developers to concurrency but introduced complexity and leaky abstractions. Structured concurrency and virtual threads offer a simpler model with clearer task relationships and blocking-style APIs, shifting complexity into the runtime.

[### Kubernetes Is Powerful, But Not Secure (at least not by default) (6 minute read)](https://www.tigera.io/blog/kubernetes-is-powerful-but-not-secure-at-least-not-by-default/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Calico v3.30 introduces Admin Network Policy and Baseline Admin Network Policy standards to improve Kubernetes cluster security by allowing platform and security engineers to define a global security posture. The new version also includes Whisker, a UI dashboard for observability, and Staged Network Policy, which simulates the effect of a policy without enforcing it.
