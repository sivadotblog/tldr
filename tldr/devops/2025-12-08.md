[### Fix messy IaC in Terraform, Not at 2 am (Sponsor)](https://www.tenable.com/cloud-security/use-cases/complete-cloud-lifecycle-visibility?utm_campaign=00034581&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_source=tldr)

Don't wait for a runtime alert to fix a build-time mistake.

Finding a security hole in production triggers a fire drill. Finding it in your Terraform is a five-minute fix.

[Tenable Cloud Security scans your IaC](https://www.tenable.com/cloud-security/use-cases/complete-cloud-lifecycle-visibility?utm_campaign=00034581&utm_medium=paid&utm_source=tldr) – including Terraform, CloudFormation, and ARM – to catch identity sprawl and bad configs at the source.

Connect build-time checks to runtime protection, so you can prevent drift, automate policy enforcement, and avoid the war room Zoom calls at ungodly hours.

Production is the wrong place to debug security.

AWS Lambda durable functions let developers write sequential, long-running workflows with automatic checkpoints, retries, and year-long waits without paying for idle compute. Using an open source SDK, they simplify state management for complex processes like approvals while preserving the standard Lambda programming model.

[### Cloudflare outage on December 5, 2025 (6 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/5-december-2025-outage/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare experienced a 25-minute network outage on December 5 that impacted approximately 28% of its HTTP traffic. It was caused by a configuration change designed to disable a WAF testing tool. This action inadvertently exposed a long-undetected bug in its FL1 proxy's rules module, leading to HTTP 500 errors. This marks the company's second major incident in weeks.

[### Introducing AWS Lambda Managed Instances: Serverless simplicity with EC2 flexibility (5 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-aws-lambda-managed-instances-serverless-simplicity-with-ec2-flexibility/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AWS Lambda Managed Instances let Lambda functions run on EC2 with full serverless simplicity while enabling specialized hardware, multiconcurrency, and EC2 pricing benefits. The feature reduces costs, removes infrastructure management, supports major runtimes, and allows easy migration for thread-safe workloads.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### Estimates – a necessary evil? (11 minute read)](https://thorsell.io/2025/12/07/estimates.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Estimates are essential for product owners to prioritize and plan releases, but developers dislike them because they're inherently uncertain and often get misused as commitments or deadlines. The real problem isn't estimating itself — it's the unrealistic expectations and pressure created when tentative estimates are treated as promises.

[### Send OpenTelemetry traces and logs from Cloudflare Workers to Grafana Cloud (6 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/12/04/send-opentelemetry-traces-and-logs-from-cloudflare-workers-to-grafana-cloud/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare Workers recently gained support for exporting OpenTelemetry logs and traces directly to Grafana Cloud. This new integration offers users pre-built dashboards to visualize critical metrics, including request counts, latency, and geographic data, without requiring agent installation.

[### Detecting React2Shell: The maximum-severity RCE Vulnerability affecting React Server Components and Next.js (3 minute read)](https://www.sysdig.com/blog/detecting-react2shell?utm_source=tldrdevops)

React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) is a critical unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability with a CVSS score of 10.0 in React Server Components (RSCs) that also impacts Next.js. It allows malicious code execution via a single crafted HTTP request with 100% exploitation success against default configurations.

[### Use Python for Scripting! (6 minute read)](https://hypirion.com/musings/use-python-for-scripting?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Python is a more portable, readable, and reliable choice than Bash for anything beyond simple scripting. It works consistently across systems and has a rich standard library. While Bash is fine for small tasks, Python avoids obscure syntax pitfalls and OS-specific behavior that often make shell scripts fragile and hard to maintain.
