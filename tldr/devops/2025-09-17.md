[### Azure mandatory multifactor authentication: Phase 2 starting in October 2025 (2 minute read)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-mandatory-multifactor-authentication-phase-2-starting-in-october-2025/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Microsoft has completed Phase 1 of mandatory multifactor authentication enforcement for Azure Portal sign-ins and will begin Phase 2 enforcement at the Azure Resource Manager layer on October 1. Users must enable MFA and update Azure CLI and PowerShell clients to remain compliant, while workload identities will remain unaffected.

[### Kubernetes v1.34: Moving Volume Group Snapshots to v1beta2 (2 minute read)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/16/kubernetes-v1-34-volume-group-snapshot-beta-2/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes v1.34 introduced a second beta for volume group snapshots, initially an Alpha feature in v1.27 and then Beta in v1.32, enabling crash-consistent snapshots for grouped volumes using CSI volume drivers. A new VolumeSnapshotInfo struct was added in v1beta2, replacing VolumeSnapshotHandlePairList, to address an issue where the restoreSize field was not set for VolumeSnapshotContents and VolumeSnapshots when the CSI driver didn't implement the ListSnapshots RPC call. Depending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes project plans to push the volume group snapshot implementation to general availability (GA) in a future release.

[### Distributed performance testing for Kubernetes environments: Grafana k6 Operator 1.0 is here (9 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/09/16/distributed-performance-testing-for-kubernetes-environments-grafana-k6-operator-1-0-is-here/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana's k6 Operator, a Kubernetes operator used for running distributed k6 tests, has reached its 1.0 release. Featuring bug fixes, improved Helm chart configurations, and better versioning, the update includes a commitment to releasing a new minor version every eight weeks and follows Semantic Versioning 2.0 for greater stability. k6 Operator simplifies distributed k6 tests across multiple machines, enabling synchronized testing within private networks, and integrates with Grafana Cloud k6.

[### P50 vs P95 vs P99 Latency: What These Percentiles Actually Mean (And How to Use Them) (4 minute read)](https://oneuptime.com/blog/post/2025-09-15-p50-vs-p95-vs-p99-latency-percentiles/view?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Use latency percentiles like P50, P95, and P99, rather than averages, to understand user experience and set SLOs. Histograms should be implemented to collect these percentiles correctly, as they reveal distribution clarity and expose systemic friction that can be addressed through architectural changes. Architectural changes often require pre-warming, partitioning, caching layers, concurrency isolation, and adaptive retries.

[### Monitor your LiteLLM AI proxy with Datadog (7 minute read)](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitor-litellm-with-datadog/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Datadog has released an Agent integration and SDK with LiteLLM that allows teams to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize LLM-powered applications. The LLM Observability SDK traces every request end-to-end, giving insights into model and provider performance, while the Datadog Agent integration monitors the LiteLLM proxy service, tracking metrics like request volumes and error rates. The integration and SDK together provide full-stack observability across LLM workflows.
