### News & Trends

[### Our $100M Series B (3 minute read)](https://oxide.computer/blog/our-100m-series-b?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Oxide has raised a $100M Series B, more than doubling its total funding to date, to scale manufacturing, expand its roadmap, and meet growing customer demand for modern on-premises infrastructure. The company has built a vertically integrated stack‚Äîfrom custom hardware to control plane software‚Äîand sees this raise as validation of its mission to redefine cloud computing for environments outside the public cloud.

[### Amazon DocumentDB Serverless is now available (3 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-documentdb-serverless-is-now-available/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Amazon DocumentDB Serverless is now generally available, offering automatic scaling of compute and memory based on application demand and potential cost savings of up to 90% compared to provisioning for peak capacity. DocumentDB Serverless is measured in DocumentDB Capacity Units (DCU) and supports version 5.0.0 and higher with a capacity range of 0.5‚Äì256 DCUs, allowing users to add serverless instances to existing provisioned clusters or convert provisioned instances to serverless instances.

[### Opsqueue: a lightweight batch processing queue for the heaviest loads (10 minute read)](https://www.channable.com/tech/introducing-opsqueue?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Channable has open-sourced Opsqueue, a lightweight Rust-based batch processing queue optimized for high-throughput, large-scale workloads. Designed for the "generate-execute" pattern, it supports billions of operations, lets consumers dynamically prioritize tasks, and emphasizes operational simplicity through a single binary with embedded SQLite and object storage integration.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### Scaling beyond IPv4: integrating IPv6 Amazon EKS clusters into existing Istio Service Mesh (9 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/scaling-beyond-ipv4-integrating-ipv6-amazon-eks-clusters-into-existing-istio-service-mesh/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Organizations adopt IPv6 for Amazon EKS clusters to overcome IPv4 address depletion, simplify networking, and enhance security, using Amazon EKS VPC CNI for seamless pod addressing. Istio Service Mesh can be configured to enable smooth interoperability and cross-cluster communication between IPv4 and IPv6 EKS clusters, supporting multi-cluster deployments across single or multiple VPCs with automated setups for scalable IPv6 adoption.

[### What is gVisor? (6 minute read)](https://blog.yelinaung.com/posts/gvisor/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

gVisor is a user-space kernel that intercepts system calls from containers to provide stronger isolation than traditional Docker setups, which share the host kernel and can be vulnerable to container escapes. By acting as a tightly controlled intermediary (the "Sentry") between untrusted code and the host OS, gVisor reduces the host's attack surface while introducing some performance overhead, making it well-suited for multi-tenant or security-sensitive environments.

[### Azure Developer CLI: From Dev to Prod with One Click (9 minute read)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/azure-developer-cli-from-dev-to-prod-with-one-click/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A single set of Bicep files dynamically provisions environment-specific Azure infrastructure by using an environment variable to control resource configurations for development and production. The Azure Developer CLI enables a ‚Äúbuild once, deploy everywhere‚Äù CI/CD pipeline that packages the app once, deploys to development, validates it, then promotes the same build artifact to production with automated environment switching and cleanup.

[### Streamline DevOps troubleshooting: Integrate CloudWatch investigations with Slack (7 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/streamline-devops-troubleshooting-integrate-cloudwatch-investigations-with-slack/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AWS introduced CloudWatch Investigations, a generative AI-powered tool that integrates with Slack to help DevOps teams quickly analyze alerts, identify root causes, and collaborate on resolutions. The integration uses Amazon Q Developer, CloudWatch, and SNS to automatically launch investigations from alarms.

[### Making Postgres 42,000x slower because I am unemployed (10 minute read)](https://byteofdev.com/posts/making-postgres-slow/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

PostgreSQL performance can be degraded over 42,000√ó by misconfiguring postgresql.conf settings alone. By minimizing cache, triggering constant autovacuum and WAL checkpoints, disabling index use through cost parameters, and forcing single-threaded I/O, throughput drops from 7,082 to just 0.016 TPS under a TPC-C benchmark. It's a good way to learn about Postgres performance.
