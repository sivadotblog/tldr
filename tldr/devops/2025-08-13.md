[### The True Cost of Kubernetes Platform Adoption (Sponsor)](https://bit.ly/3URhfFA)

Kubernetes is free to adopt ‚Äî but costly to run. [This research paper](https://bit.ly/3URhfFA) breaks down the real labor cost of building and operating a production-grade [Kubernetes platform](https://bit.ly/3URhfFA), from 1 cluster to 100+.

Highlights:

* Labor, not infrastructure, drives up to 70% of total spend
* Even one cluster with no SLA costs $90K+ in year one
* At enterprise scale, annual labor costs exceed $675K
* Each extra ‚Äúnine‚Äù of uptime adds 20‚Äì30% more cost

See the full breakdown and strategies to cut cost & risk.

[### Learn OpenTelemetry tracing through a grand strategy game: introducing Game of Traces (13 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/08/11/learn-opentelemetry-tracing-through-a-grand-strategy-game-introducing-game-of-traces/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana Labs has released Game of Traces, a grand strategy game built to teach engineers the key concepts of OpenTelemetry tracing by representing game elements as services instrumented with OTel. The game uses the Grafana LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Mimir) to track wins, losses, and interactions, allowing players to understand service flow, span attributes, and telemetry signal correlation.

[### Kubernetes 1.34: 10 new Alpha features (6 minute read)](https://platformengineering.org/blog/kubernetes-1-34-10-new-alpha-features?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes 1.34 introduces several alpha features, including Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) advancements for specialized hardware like GPUs, improvements to YAML configuration, streamlined secure certificate delivery via PodCertificateRequest, and asynchronous API interactions for faster scheduling. Other key enhancements involve using NominatedNodeName to express pod placement preferences, Pod Security Admission rules to prevent SSRF attacks, relaxed validation for service names, and the ability to set arbitrary FQDNs as pod hostnames.

[### Go 1.25 Release Notes (13 minute read)](https://go.dev/doc/go1.25?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Go 1.25 focuses on toolchain, runtime, and library improvements while maintaining compatibility, introducing features like container-aware GOMAXPROCS, an experimental high-performance garbage collector, the runtime/trace.FlightRecorder API, and the new testing/synctest package. It also adds experimental encoding/json/v2, performance optimizations, stricter runtime checks, numerous standard library enhancements, and updated platform support.

[### Innovating with a Rock-Solid Foundation While Saving 40% on Networking Costs: Imagine Learning's Journey with Linkerd (4 minute read)](https://linkerd.io/2025/08/01/imagine-learning-linkerd/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Imagine Learning implemented Linkerd on AWS EKS to secure and simplify communication across hundreds of microservices, improving reliability and observability with tools like Argo CD and Argo Rollouts. This transition cut operational overhead by 20%, reduced service mesh compute needs by over 80%, and lowered networking costs by 40%, while boosting security and minimizing disruptions for users.

[### Not So Direct I/O (8 minute read)](https://jmcph4.dev/posts/not-so-direct-io.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Even when using O\_DIRECT with 4 KB-aligned reads and writes, read(2) can return fewer than 4096 bytes if the file's logical end falls before the end of its final physical sector. This occurs because direct I/O bypasses the page cache but still depends on the filesystem's logical-to-physical mapping, so EOF can occur mid-sector‚Äîmeaning applications must handle short reads and not assume a full block will always be returned.

[### Best practices for analyzing AWS Config recording frequencies (4 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/best-practices-for-analyzing-aws-config-recording-frequencies/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AWS Config offers two recording modes, continuous and periodic, to help organizations balance operational visibility, compliance needs, and cost based on resource behavior and environment type. Evaluating resource staticity, service relationships, and baseline change frequency allows for optimized configuration recording strategies tailored to inventory management, compliance monitoring, security investigations, and continuous auditing.
