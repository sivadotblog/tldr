[### Does GenAI actually make engineers more productive? And how do you measure it? (Sponsor)](https://jellyfish.co/resources/gen-ai-perception-vs-reality/?utm_source=tldr-devops&amp;utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship&amp;utm_campaign=primary-placement&amp;utm_content=genAI-slides&amp;utm_term=download-now)

Companies have invested heavily in AI coding tools ‚Äî and it's time to talk about ROI.

In 2024, Jellyfish introduced the Github Copilot Dashboard to measure the impact of one of the most widely-adopted genAI coding tools. With 200+ companies providing data, this provides a [representative sample](https://jellyfish.co/resources/gen-ai-perception-vs-reality/?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship&utm_campaign=primary-placement&utm_content=genAI-slides&utm_term=download-now) of how engineering organizations are using Copilot and how it's impacting production.

üìä See the data on [GitHub Copilot's impact on 4,200+ engineers](https://jellyfish.co/resources/gen-ai-perception-vs-reality/?utm_source=tldr-devops&utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship&utm_campaign=primary-placement&utm_content=genAI-slides&utm_term=download-now) at 200+ companies, presented by Jellyfish CEO Andrew Lau.
