[### üÜï Chainguard Libraries: Guarded Java Language Dependencies Built from Source (Sponsor)](https://www.chainguard.dev/libraries?utm_source=TLDRdevops&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email-ad)

Public package repositories are increasingly under attack as they've been designed for publisher ease instead of enterprise consumption. With the MavenGate attack in Jan 2024, attackers compromised abandoned Maven Central domains to hijack critical java projects like Gradle.

This challenge of insecure language libraries creates constant security headaches, and often results in added DevOps friction due to the need to curate or approve builds.

[Chainguard Libraries](https://www.chainguard.dev/libraries?utm_source=TLDRdevops&utm_medium=email&utm_content=email-ad) is a catalog of guarded language dependencies built entirely from source in hardened build environments. It eliminates supply chain attacks at package build and distribution, standardizes open source, and reduces developer friction.
