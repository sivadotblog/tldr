[### Life’s too short to self-manage Kubernetes (Sponsor)](https://gcore.com/cloud/managed-kubernetes?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=tldr_cpc_cloud_k8s_ww_post)

Looking to scale faster and simplify ops with Managed Kubernetes?

[Gcore](https://gcore.com/cloud/managed-kubernetes?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=tldr_cpc_cloud_k8s_ww_post) offers one-click provisioning, GPU worker nodes, automated scaling and control, 24/7 technical support, and a whole lot more — and it [costs less than 20%](https://gcore.com/cloud/managed-kubernetes?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=tldr_cpc_cloud_k8s_ww_post) than what you’d pay AWS or GCP.

Key benefits include:

* [Bare-Metal support](https://gcore.com/cloud/managed-kubernetes?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=tldr_cpc_cloud_k8s_ww_post) for worker nodes to improve latency and performance
* [Free production-grade cluster management](https://gcore.com/cloud/managed-kubernetes?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=tldr_cpc_cloud_k8s_ww_post) with a 99.9% SLA, with no additional fees
* [Great price/value ratio](https://gcore.com/cloud/managed-kubernetes?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=tldr_cpc_cloud_k8s_ww_post) for worker nodes — the same as for VMs and Bare Metal servers
