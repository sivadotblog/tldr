[### What happens when a 300-year-old bank goes all-in on feature flags? (Sponsor)](https://www.getunleash.io/lloyds-jan-2026-webinar#Register?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=tldr)

Lloyds Banking Group has been around since 1765. Now they're running one of the most ambitious digital transformations in UK banking — with feature flags at the center of it.

[In this live webinar](https://www.getunleash.io/lloyds-jan-2026-webinar#Register?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tldr), Daniel Woollery (Head of Digital Services, Lloyds) shares how the bank scaled [FeatureOps](https://www.getunleash.io/lloyds-jan-2026-webinar#Register?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tldr) from scattered team experiments to an enterprise-wide platform.

📋 On the agenda: migrating hundreds of flags off legacy systems, building governance that accelerates delivery, and rolling out GenAI with feature-level risk controls.

🕰️ Webinar starts January 19 @ 10AM ET. [Save your spot](https://www.getunleash.io/lloyds-jan-2026-webinar#Register?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tldr)

[### Kubernetes v1.35: A Better Way to Pass Service Account Tokens to CSI Drivers (4 minute read)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/07/kubernetes-v1-35-csi-sa-tokens-secrets-field-beta/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes v1.35 introduces a beta opt-in solution for CSI drivers, enabling them to securely receive service account tokens through the `secrets` field in `NodePublishVolumeRequest` instead of the less secure `volume\_context`. This addresses past logging vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2023-2878, by providing a safer, more consistent method for handling sensitive data.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### Software craftsmanship is dead (3 minute read)](https://www.pcloadletter.dev/blog/craftsmanship-is-dead/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Modern software development prioritizes rapid feature delivery and short-term impact metrics over long-term code quality and maintainability. Incentive structures, Agile backlog pressure, low deployment risk, and a lack of emphasis on craftsmanship have collectively contributed to declining code quality across organizations.

[### Why we're leaving serverless (5 minute read)](https://www.unkey.com/blog/serverless-exit?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Unkey migrated from Cloudflare Workers to stateful Go servers, achieving 6x lower latency by eliminating external cache network requests and simplifying architecture from complex distributed pipelines to straightforward in-memory batching. The move enabled self-hosting and platform independence, improved developer experience, and reduced operational complexity.

[### A closer look at a BGP anomaly in Venezuela (9 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-route-leak-venezuela/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A routing leak in Venezuela on January 2, involving AS8048 (CANTV), was noted by a cybersecurity newsletter amid news of Nicolás Maduro's capture, initially suggesting potential malfeasance. However, Cloudflare Radar data showed eleven similar, likely accidental, Type 1 hairpin route leaks by CANTV since early December, indicating the issue stemmed from insufficient routing export and import policies rather than malicious intent.

[### Improve service reliability and ops culture with Grafana Cloud Service Center (7 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/improve-service-reliability-and-ops-culture-with-grafana-cloud-service-center/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana Cloud's Service Center provides a unified hub for monitoring service reliability, performance trends, incidents, SLOs, alerts, and on-call rotations to prevent engineer burnout and improve operational culture. The feature centralizes scattered data into service pages that help teams make data-driven decisions about reliability improvements and workload balancing.

[### PostgreSQL 18 RETURNING Enhancements: A Game Changer for Modern Applications (7 minute read)](https://www.pgedge.com/blog/postgresql-18-returning-enhancements-a-game-changer-for-modern-applications?utm_source=tldrdevops)

PostgreSQL 18 significantly enhances the RETURNING clause by introducing OLD and NEW aliases across INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE, enabling developers to access before-and-after row values in a single atomic statement. This removes the need for triggers or extra queries, simplifies change tracking and auditing, and makes MERGE-based upserts far more powerful and maintainable.
