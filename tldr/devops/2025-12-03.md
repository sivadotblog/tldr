[### Infrastructure is changing 5x faster than a decade ago. Is platform engineering keeping up? (Sponsor)](https://www.env0.com/resources-center/whitepaper-platform-engineering-3-0?utm_source=thirdparty&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Q4-2025-TLDR-DevOps&amp;utm_content=cta)

In the monolith era, teams handled 100-200 infrastructure changes per day. In the AI era, that number is approaching 1,000. Manual reviews and reactive incident handling won't cut it.

The [Platform Engineering 3.0 whitepaper from env zero](https://www.env0.com/resources-center/whitepaper-platform-engineering-3-0?utm_source=thirdparty&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Q4-2025-TLDR-DevOps&utm_content=cta) examines what happens next: how governance, automation, and AI-assisted workflows need to evolve together - and a five-phase maturity model for getting there without losing control.

[### Amazon EKS introduces Provisioned Control Plane (2 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-introduces-provisioned-control-plane/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Amazon EKS now offers a Provisioned Control Plane that pre-allocates capacity in defined scaling tiers to deliver predictable, high performance for demanding workloads like large-scale AI, SaaS platforms, and mission-critical applications. These tiers provide guaranteed API concurrency, pod scheduling throughput, and database size with flexible upgrades, detailed monitoring, and significantly higher scaling limits than the standard control plane.

[### 100,000 TPS over a billion rows: the unreasonable effectiveness of SQLite (8 minute read)](https://andersmurphy.com/2025/12/02/100000-tps-over-a-billion-rows-the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-sqlite.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

SQLite can achieve extremely high transaction throughput on a single machine because eliminating network latency and using a single-writer model enables batching and efficient concurrency with readers. In contrast, network databases like Postgres hit hard limits from latency and contention, showing that SQLite's “limitations” are actually strengths for many real-world workloads.
