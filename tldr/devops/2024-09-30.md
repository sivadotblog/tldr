[### Everything you need to know about Python 3.13 ‚Äì JIT and GIL went up the hill (19 minute read)](https://drew.silcock.dev/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-python-3-13/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Python 3.13 introduces two significant changes: the ability to disable the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) for free-threaded execution and support for experimental Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation. These updates aim to enhance Python's performance, particularly for CPU-bound tasks, and mark the beginning of a gradual rollout towards a fully free-threaded Python in future versions. Immediate changes to existing Python code are minimal - the performance benefits will become more evident over time.
