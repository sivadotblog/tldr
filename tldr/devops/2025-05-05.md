[### Is Frontend Observability Hipster RUM? (8 minute read)](https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2025/04/02/is-frontend-observability-hipster-rum/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Frontend observability is emerging as a new category that builds on Real User Monitoring to better track and improve the end-user experience, but it faces confusion over its purpose and audience. While vendors are promoting it as a bridge between frontend and backend concerns, its success depends on clearly identifying who within engineering teams will actually use and benefit from these tools.

[### Migrating from Serverless Framework to CDK (13 minute read)](https://speedrun.nobackspacecrew.com/blog/2025/03/11/migrating-from-serverless-framework-to-cdk.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Migrating the Speedrun API from the Serverless Framework V3 to the Cloud Development Kit and moving from API Gateway to CloudFront requires manual, iterative steps, including handling resource retention, importing to the CDK, and managing deployment in a development environment.

[### You can't prevent your last outage, no matter how hard you try (2 minute read)](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/05/04/you-cant-prevent-your-last-outage-no-matter-how-hard-you-try/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Organizations wrongly prioritize post-incident work based on severity, assuming high-severity incidents offer the best insights for preventing future ones. In reality, major incidents often differ from past ones, and valuable signals may come from lower-severity issues or entirely different sources, making severity a poor proxy for risk reduction potential.

[### How Netflix Accurately Attributes eBPF Flow Logs (9 minute read)](https://netflixtechblog.com/how-netflix-accurately-attributes-ebpf-flow-logs-afe6d644a3bc?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Netflix developed a new method to accurately attribute IP addresses in eBPF flow logs to workload identities, eliminating previous issues with misattribution caused by delays in IP assignment updates. By leveraging in-memory maps, local attribution at the source, and a Kafka-based synchronization system, the new approach ensures reliable network insights across Netflix's cloud infrastructure.

[### From virtual machine to Kubernetes to serverless: How dacadoo saved 78% on cloud costs and automated operations (5 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/from-virtual-machine-to-kubernetes-to-serverless-how-dacadoo-saved-78-on-cloud-costs-and-automated-operations?utm_source=tldrdevops)
