[### Terraform vs OpenTofu: Which IaC tool fits your platform strategy? (5 minute read)](https://platformengineering.org/blog/terraform-vs-opentofu-iac-tool?utm_source=tldrdevops)

HashiCorp's Terraform infrastructure-as-code tool was forked to create OpenTofu in response to HashiCorp's license change in August 2023. OpenTofu operates under a Mozilla Public License 2.0 under the Linux Foundation, while Terraform uses a Business Source License restricting some commercial use. Key differences also include OpenTofu's native state file encryption versus Terraform's reliance on external solutions. Platform teams should consider governance requirements, long-term risk tolerance, and alignment with their overall engineering strategy when choosing between the two tools.

An organization with a multi-cloud approach across AWS, Azure, and GCP reduced fragmented visibility, long outages, and frustrated engineers by adopting OpenTelemetry (OTel), a CNCF graduated project. With OTel, the organization was able to treat observability as part of their platform engineering strategy by unifying a fragmented, multi-cloud ecosystem and giving developers the flexibility to focus on building features instead of wrestling with telemetry.
