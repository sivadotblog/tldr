[### Ubuntu 25.10 Replaces sudo With a Rust-Based Equivalent (5 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/ubuntu-25-10-replaces-sudo-with-a-rust-based-equivalent/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Canonical is replacing the traditional sudo command in Ubuntu 25.10 with a new version called sudo-rs, written in Rust, to improve memory safety and system security. Although sudo-rs is still under development and must be installed manually for now, it functions similarly to sudo and will eventually become the default while keeping the original sudo available as a fallback.

[### You're not a platform team if you're just managing infrastructure (5 minute read)](https://platformengineering.org/blog/youre-not-a-platform-team-if-youre-just-managing-infrastructure?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Many companies are renaming roles to "platform engineer" without fundamentally changing the work, leading to problems with Day-2 Operations and scalability, as teams still provision infrastructure manually with tools like Kubernetes instead of Linux VMs.

[### Implementing Grafana Play privacy policies with Grafana k6: A behind-the-scenes look (8 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/06/10/implementing-grafana-play-privacy-policies-with-grafana-k6-a-behind-the-scenes-look/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana Labs removed over 21,000 inactive users and deprecated broken dashboards from Grafana Play, a public sandbox environment for learning Grafana, to enhance security and data privacy. The cleanup involved using Python, JavaScript, and Grafana k6 to identify users inactive for over a year who had not created dashboards and detect broken panels in dashboards by scanning the DOM for error indicators.
