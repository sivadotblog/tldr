[### Prove GitHub Copilot's Real Value Beyond "Developers Seem to Like It" (Sponsor)](https://hubs.la/Q03kry1j0)

Hype doesn't pay the bills. Can you quantify the ROI of spending $252/seat on GitHub Copilot (or other coding assistants)?

This [no-buzzword webinar](https://hubs.la/Q03kry1j0) shows how engineering leaders can answer this question with cold hard metrics, rather than ‘trust me bro'.

Learn how to go beyond usage dashboard and [track productivity gains](https://hubs.la/Q03kry1j0) in cycle times and commit velocity, monitor code quality/security risks, and compare effectiveness across platforms like Copilot, Cursor, and Amazon Q.

[### Kubernetes v1.33: Storage Capacity Scoring of Nodes for Dynamic Provisioning (alpha) (2 minute read)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/30/kubernetes-v1-33-storage-capacity-scoring-feature/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes v1.33 introduces StorageCapacityScoring, an alpha feature that adds a scoring method for pod scheduling using topology-aware volume provisioning. With StorageCapacityScoring enabled, the kube-scheduler's VolumeBinding plugin can now prioritize nodes with either the most or least available storage capacity, and the VolumeCapacityPriority feature gate will be deprecated as a result.

Trail of Bits collaborated with PyPI to optimize the performance of its Warehouse test suite, cutting test time by 81%—from 163 to 30 seconds—while increasing total tests to over 4,700. Key improvements included parallelizing tests with pytest-xdist, leveraging Python 3.12's sys.monitoring for faster coverage, configuring testpaths, and removing slow imports like ddtrace.

[### Systematically Terraforming a Brownfield of Cloud Infrastructure (15 minute read)](https://www.evalapply.org/posts/systems-approach-to-infrastructure-as-code/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Building a scalable and maintainable Terraform infrastructure system for a heavily regulated fintech startup involves navigating complex business silos, compliance constraints, and real-world ops challenges. The Terraform model must be mastered by designing with operator safety in mind and favoring simplicity, experimentation, and first-party tooling over premature framework adoption.

[### Pre-Cache Terraform Provider Plugins (3 minute read)](https://dev.to/zloeber/pre-cache-terraform-provider-plugins-42kn?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Pre-caching Terraform providers in CI/CD pipeline images can significantly reduce run times and eliminate reliance on external registries, improving stability and efficiency at scale. A new project with Docker and script tools simplifies pre-caching setup by automating provider downloads and supporting multiple Terraform versions.
