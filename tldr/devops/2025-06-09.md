[### The Evolution of Virtualization Platforms: The Rise of Managed Services and Local Providers' Edge Against Hyperscalers (9 minute read)](https://blog.aenix.io/the-evolution-of-virtualization-platforms-the-rise-of-managed-services-and-local-providers-edge-0cb5db21a330?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Virtualization's purpose has been reshaped by the shift to cloud computing. Virtual machines have lost ground to managed services like Kubernetes, databases, and queues. The rise of "as-a-Service" ecosystems has advantaged cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure, which have mature PaaS offerings compared to local providers often stuck offering basic IaaS. Platforms like √Ünix's Cozystack can help local providers compete with tech giants by delivering managed services on their own hardware.
