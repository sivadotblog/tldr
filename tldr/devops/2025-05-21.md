### News & Trends

[### Your IPs, your rules: enabling more efficient address space usage (7 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/your-ips-your-rules-enabling-more-efficient-address-space-usage/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare has enhanced its BYOIP (Bring Your Own IP) capabilities, allowing customers to dynamically reassign portions of their IP prefixes between services like CDN, Spectrum, and Magic Transit to optimize IP address usage and control costs, as IPv4 addresses now exceed $30-$50 per address due to scarcity.

[### Introducing Docker Hardened Images: Secure, Minimal, and Ready for Production (4 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/introducing-docker-hardened-images/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Docker Hardened Images (DHI) were introduced by Docker as secure-by-default container images for modern production environments. These images reduce the attack surface by up to 95% and are continuously updated to ensure near-zero known CVEs, with critical and high-severity CVEs patched within 7 days. DHI supports distros like Alpine and Debian and integrates with platforms like Microsoft, NGINX, and Sonatype.

[### Amazon Inspector enhances container security by mapping Amazon ECR images to running containers (6 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-inspector-enhances-container-security-by-mapping-amazon-ecr-images-to-running-containers/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Amazon Inspector now maps ECR images to running containers and extends vulnerability scanning to minimal base images, allowing security teams to prioritize vulnerabilities based on images actively running in their environment.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### How to install and run Minikube with Rootless Podman on ARM-based MacBooks (6 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/05/13/how-to-install-and-run-minikube-with-rootless-podman-on-arm-based-macbooks/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Minikube can be installed and run on ARM-based MacBooks using rootless Podman by setting up a Podman machine with Homebrew, configuring it appropriately, and starting it in rootless mode for improved security. Once Podman is running, Minikube can be installed via Homebrew, configured for rootless operation, and started using the Podman driver to provide a local Kubernetes environment, with deployment and port-forwarding managed through kubectl or minikube kubectl.

[### Too Much Go Misdirection (3 minute read)](https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/too-much-go-misdirection)

Go's interface design and standard library conventions often hinder zero-copy optimizations, especially when working with io.Reader and trying to reuse existing []byte buffers. Due to missing implementations like Peek on bytes.Reader and hidden wrappers like bufio.Reader, developers must resort to custom types and undocumented interface patterns—what amounts to a “shadow API”—to achieve efficient behavior without relying on unsafe hacks.

[### The Kubernetes Surgeon's Handbook: Precision Recovery from etcd Snapshots (4 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/05/08/the-kubernetes-surgeons-handbook-precision-recovery-from-etcd-snapshots/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Precision recovery from etcd snapshots enables Kubernetes administrators to restore specific resources like ConfigMaps without initiating a full cluster rollback. By using tools such as etcdctl, auger, and kubectl, admins can isolate, decode, and reapply deleted objects with minimal disruption.

[### OpenVox InfraTales - macOS Signing and Notarization (5 minute read)](https://overlookinfratech.com/2025/05/12/macos-signing/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This post describes the process of making the OpenVox macOS agent fully signed and notarized to meet Apple's stricter Gatekeeper requirements in macOS 15, ensuring binaries, dylibs, and bundles are properly secured. The new build system centralizes signing and notarization within Vanagon, with future plans to streamline builds via GitHub Actions and increase accessibility beyond the current VM setup.

[### Revenue Attribution Report: how we used homomorphic encryption to enhance privacy and cut network congestion by 99% (3 minute read)](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/data/how-we-used-homomorphic-encryption-to-enhance-privacy-and-cut-network-congestion?utm_source=tldrdevops)

LinkedIn's Revenue Attribution Report (RAR) now features a new system that computes queries over encrypted records without decrypting each row, boosting performance and security. By leveraging privacy-enhancing technologies like additive symmetric homomorphic encryption (ASHE), the new approach has reduced network congestion by over 99% and enabled a wider range of reporting capabilities.
