[### Supabase MCP can leak your entire SQL database (5 minute read)](https://www.generalanalysis.com/blog/supabase-mcp-blog?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A vulnerability in Supabase's Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration allows attackers to leak sensitive SQL data by embedding prompt injections in user-submitted support messages. The AI assistant operates with elevated service\_role privileges and cannot distinguish between data and instructions, so it may inadvertently execute malicious commands and expose protected tables like integration\_tokens.

[### Netflix Tudum Architecture: from CQRS with Kafka to CQRS with RAW Hollow (5 minute read)](https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-tudum-architecture-from-cqrs-with-kafka-to-cqrs-with-raw-hollow-86d141b72e52?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Netflix's fan destination, Tudum.com, has adopted RAW Hollow, an in-memory database developed by Netflix, to reduce data propagation times and speed up request processing. With the new architecture, homepage construction time decreased from ~1.4 seconds to ~0.4 seconds, and writers/editors can preview changes in seconds instead of minutes, by eliminating the Page Data Service, Key Value store, and Kafka infrastructure. Hollow's high-density near cache significantly reduces I/O, allowing Tudum's various microservices to access data synchronously in O(1) time.
