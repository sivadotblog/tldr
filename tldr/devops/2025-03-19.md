[### Infrastructure automation survey reveals overconfidence — and speed coming at the cost of control (Sponsor)](https://spacelift.io/infrastructure-automation-survey?utm_campaign=9637438-FY25%20-%20WW%20-%20Strategic%20-%20The%20Infrastructure%20Automation%20Report%202025&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Primary%20placement%20-%20Title)

The [2025 Infrastructure Automation Report](https://spacelift.io/infrastructure-automation-survey?utm_campaign=9637438-FY25%20-%20WW%20-%20Strategic%20-%20The%20Infrastructure%20Automation%20Report%202025&utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Primary%20placement%20-%20Title)—a research survey commissioned by Spacelift—suggests teams are very confident of their capabilities, with 45% claiming to ace infrastructure automation.

However, a closer look reveals that only 14% have actually achieved superior automation capabilities 😬

For many, speed has been prioritized over control: 43% of teams regularly rerun their infrastructure deployments at four times or more.
