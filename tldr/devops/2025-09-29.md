Visual Studio 2026 Insiders introduces deeply integrated AI, making code reviews, documentation, and debugging more seamless while reducing developer overhead. The release also delivers major performance boosts, a modernized Fluent UI design, and a new Insiders Channel for early feature access, all aimed at keeping developers in flow and accelerating productivity.

[### Every Cloudflare feature, available to everyone (5 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/enterprise-grade-features-for-all/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Nearly all of Cloudflare's features, previously limited to enterprise customers, will become available for purchase by anyone on any plan without contracts or sales involvement. The rollout will begin with dashboard Single Sign-On and will expand over the next year to include other advanced capabilities, reinforcing Cloudflare's mission to make powerful Internet security and performance tools accessible to all users.

[### Safe in the sandbox: security hardening for Cloudflare Workers (13 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/safe-in-the-sandbox-security-hardening-for-cloudflare-workers/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare has strengthened the security of Workers by modifying the V8 runtime to use memory protection keys and a software-based sandbox, preventing cross-isolate data access and containing memory corruption attacks. These improvements create layered defenses that block escalation attempts, ensuring user code runs safely on Cloudflare's globally distributed infrastructure without requiring customer intervention.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### What is "good taste" in software engineering? (7 minute read)](https://www.seangoedecke.com/taste/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Good taste in software engineering isn't about raw skill but about choosing the right engineering values‚Äîlike readability, scalability, or resiliency‚Äîfor the problem at hand. Engineers with good taste stay flexible, avoid rigid ‚Äúbest practices,‚Äù and make tradeoffs that fit their project's context, leading to more successful outcomes over time.

[### Code Mode: the better way to use MCP (10 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AI agents can handle more tools and more complex tools by converting Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools into a TypeScript API and having LLMs write code to call that API. This approach uses the Cloudflare Workers platform and its new Worker Loader API, which loads Worker code on-demand with a secure sandbox that prohibits internet access. It isolates access to MCP servers through bindings and prevents the AI from leaking API keys.

[### Priorities (3 minute read)](https://archaeologist.dev/artifacts/priorities?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Focusing only on urgent tasks in software engineering leaves bugs and technical debt unresolved, eventually slowing development and frustrating users. Teams can avoid this by reserving capacity for lower-priority but important work through strategies like time allocation, dedicated ownership, or zero-tolerance policies.
