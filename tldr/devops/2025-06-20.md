[### Codacy Guardrails: Real-time security and quality checks for AI-generated code (Sponsor)](https://www.codacy.com/guardrails?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tldr2)

AI coding agents like VS Code Agent Mode and Cursor are fast, but can easily introduce insecure or non-compliant code. [Codacy Guardrails](https://www.codacy.com/guardrails?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr2) silently scans and fixes AI-suggested code that contains vulnerabilities or violates your coding standards, while the code is being generated.

* Free, local, real-time scans for AI-suggested code
* Make every line of AI code play by your rules
* Auto-fix security and quality issues in your IDE
* Enforce standards before your code reaches Git

By embedding trusted static analysis within your AI coding flow, Guardrails finally unlocks AI-driven development at scale.

[### Intent-to-infrastructure: Platform engineers break bottlenecks with AI (7 minute read)](https://platformengineering.org/blog/intent-to-infrastructure-platform-engineers-break-bottlenecks-with-ai?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Platform engineers are facing a bottleneck as AI allows developers to generate entire applications in hours while infrastructure provisioning still takes days. To solve this, Intent-to-Infrastructure is emerging, which uses AI to translate "what we need" into infrastructure, allowing platform teams to scale infrastructure delivery and cut manual bottlenecks.

[### What Would a Kubernetes 2.0 Look Like (13 minute read)](https://matduggan.com/what-would-a-kubernetes-2-0-look-like/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes has revolutionized infrastructure management over the past decade, enabling scalable, self-healing, declarative systems, but it now faces critical usability and architectural limitations. A proposed Kubernetes 2.0 would replace YAML with HCL for safer, more expressive configs, support pluggable storage backends beyond etcd, introduce a native package manager to replace Helm, default to IPv6 networking, and emphasize better defaults to streamline user experience and reduce operational overhead.

[### The Jitter-Trap: How Randomness Betrays the Evasive (8 minute read)](https://www.varonis.com/blog/jitter-trap?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Varonis Threat Labs has developed Jitter-Trap, a new technique to detect C2 communication by identifying patterns of randomness. The technique analyzes the sleep and jitter parameters of beacon traffic, as well as URL variations, to uncover malicious activity, even when frameworks like Cobalt Strike and Sliver are used.

[### Prometheus data source update: Redefining our big tent philosophy (5 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/06/16/prometheus-data-source-update-redefining-our-big-tent-philosophy/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana Labs has deprecated AWS and Azure authentication from its core Prometheus data source, replacing them with dedicated plugins tailored to each platform's specific requirements. The company is evolving its ‚Äúbig tent‚Äù philosophy to emphasize purpose-built data sources that maintain upstream compatibility, promote interoperability, and support vendor-specific features without compromising the integrity of open source projects like Prometheus.

[### Defending the Internet: how Cloudflare blocked a monumental 7.3 Tbps DDoS attack (8 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/defending-the-internet-how-cloudflare-blocked-a-monumental-7-3-tbps-ddos/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Cloudflare autonomously blocked a record-breaking 7.3 terabits per second (Tbps) DDoS attack in mid-May that targeted a hosting provider using Magic Transit.
