[### [Webinar] Securely Access Kubernetes without Port Forwarding and Jump Hosts (Sponsor)](https://netbird.io/webinars/achieve-zero-trust-access-to-k8s?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=2502%20-%20webinar%20-%20How%20to%20Achieve%20Zero%20Trust%20Access%20to%20Kubernetes%20-%20Effortlessly&amp;utm_medium=email)

Accessing Kubernetes securely shouldn't be complicated. Managing VPN gateways, firewall rules, and security groups is time-consuming. Exposing API endpoints or using jump hosts creates security risks.

In this webinar, NetBird.io founder, [Mikhail Bragin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikhailbragin/), will show you how to securely access Kubernetes without port forwarding, setting up VPN gateways, or dealing with complex firewall configurations. He'll cover:

* Challenges of securing Kubernetes access.
* Simplifying access to Kubernetes services from non-Kubernetes resources.
* Achieving Zero Trust access to your control plane and services.
