### News & Trends

[### Wasm 3.0 (5 minute read)](https://webassembly.org/news/2025-09-17-wasm-3.0/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Wasm 3.0 introduces major long-awaited features, including 64-bit memory, multiple memories, garbage collection, typed references, tail calls, native exception handling, relaxed SIMD, deterministic execution profiles, custom annotations, and new JS string builtins. These upgrades significantly expand Wasm's ability to support high-level languages and large-scale applications. Widespread adoption is already underway across browsers and standalone engines.

[### Oracle Releases Java 25 (3 minute read)](https://www.devopsdigest.com/oracle-releases-java-25?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Java 25 delivers thousands of improvements aimed at boosting developer productivity along with performance, stability, and security enhancements. The version will receive quarterly updates until September 2028 under NFTC, followed by OTN licensing with long-term support planned until at least September 2033.

[### Kubernetes v1.34: Recovery From Volume Expansion Failure (GA) (3 minute read)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/19/kubernetes-v1-34-recover-expansion-failure/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes v1.34 now generally supports automated recovery from storage expansion, allowing users to correct mistakes in PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) size requests without admin intervention as long as the new size is larger than the original allocated size. The update introduces new API fields in PVC objects, such as `.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage']`, to monitor volume expansion progress. Errors are now reported as conditions on PVC objects, addressing a long-standing bug in the resizing workflow. Kubernetes will also retry failed volume expansions at a slower rate to reduce requests to both the storage system and the Kubernetes API server.

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### Single-tenant vs. multi-tenant architecture with Grafana Cloud: A guide to choosing the right approach (6 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/09/18/single-tenant-vs-multi-tenant-architecture-with-grafana-cloud-how-to-choose-the-right-approach/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana Cloud users can manage tenancy through single or multiple stacks, with the single-stack approach using role-based (RBAC) and label-based (LBAC) access control being recommended in most cases.

[### eBPF: The Silent Power Behind Cloud Native's Next Phase (4 minute read)](https://cloudnativenow.com/features/ebpf-the-silent-power-behind-cloud-natives-next-phase/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

eBPF is emerging as the foundational technology for Cloud Native 2.0 by enabling kernel-level networking, observability, and security without the overhead of sidecars or intrusive instrumentation. It delivers deep visibility and programmability across platforms, quietly reshaping cloud-native infrastructure while posing challenges in complexity, portability, and standardization.

[### Less is safer: how Obsidian reduces the risk of supply chain attacks (3 minute read)](https://obsidian.md/blog/less-is-safer/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Obsidian reduces supply chain attack risks by minimizing third-party dependencies, re-implementing or forking code where possible, and shipping only a small, controlled set of version-pinned libraries. It further protects users through slow, review-heavy dependency updates, strict lockfiles, no postinstall scripts, and deliberate release delays that allow time for the ecosystem to flag malicious versions.

### Miscellaneous

[### DeepSeek-V3.1 model now available in Amazon Bedrock (3 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/deepseek-v3-1-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

DeepSeek-V3.1 is now available as a fully managed foundation model in Amazon Bedrock, offering improved performance in tool usage, agent tasks, and support for over 100 languages. The hybrid open weight model switches between thinking mode (chain-of-thought reasoning) and non-thinking mode for faster responses. It is accessible through the Amazon Bedrock console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDK in select regions.

[### Extending deployment pipelines with Amazon ECS blue green deployments and lifecycle hooks (5 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/extending-deployment-pipelines-with-amazon-ecs-blue-green-deployments-and-lifecycle-hooks/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Amazon ECS now supports native blue/green deployments along with lifecycle hooks, enabling custom logic such as governance checks, automated tests, and manual approvals directly in deployment pipelines. Lifecycle hooks use Lambda functions to control deployment stages, allowing policies like image validation before scaling tasks and approval gates before shifting production traffic.
