[### Announcing Kyverno Release 1.15! (4 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/08/30/announcing-kyverno-release-1-15/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kyverno 1.15 enhances Kubernetes policy management with new CEL-based policy types. It introduces MutatingPolicy, GeneratingPolicy, and DeletingPolicy, all of which convert automatically to Kubernetes admission controllers. The update shows significant performance improvements when using ValidatingPolicy over traditional ClusterPolicy for Pod Security Standards (PSS) enforcement.

[### Kubernetes v1.34: Finer-Grained Control Over Container Restarts (4 minute read)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/08/29/kubernetes-v1-34-per-container-restart-policy/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes 1.34 introduced a new alpha feature, "Container Restart Policy and Rules," allowing users to define restart policies for individual containers within a Pod. This feature, enabled behind the ContainerRestartRules feature gate, provides granular control over container restarts based on exit codes, addressing limitations of the previous Pod-level restart policy. It can be useful for long-running AI/ML workloads where in-place restarts of failed containers with retriable exit codes are needed for better resource utilization.

[### Replacing a cache service with a database (4 minute read)](https://avi.im/blag/2025/db-cache/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Caches provide pre-computed data at ultra-low latencies and offer fine-grained control, eviction policies, and lightweight scaling that databases cannot yet match. While partial replicas, incremental view maintenance, and advanced structures may narrow the gap, caches remain indispensable because databases are still too heavy, costly, and connection-limited for typical cache workloads.
