[### Faster, more memory-efficient performance in Grafana Mimir: a closer look at Mimir Query Engine (9 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/09/17/faster-more-memory-efficient-performance-in-grafana-mimir-a-closer-look-at-mimir-query-engine/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana Mimir 2.17 introduces the Mimir Query Engine (MQE), which offers faster and more memory-efficient performance by processing queries in a streaming manner, reducing peak memory utilization by 92% in some tests. MQE, which is 100% compatible with PromQL, addresses the issue of unpredictable memory consumption in Mimir with Prometheus' engine. It can be toggled via the command line.

[### Kubernetes v1.34: Pods Report DRA Resource Health (3 minute read)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/17/kubernetes-v1-34-pods-report-dra-resource-health/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes v1.34 introduces a new alpha feature that provides better visibility into the health of specialized hardware like GPUs and FPGAs. Controlled by the ResourceHealthStatus feature gate, the update extends KEP-4680 functionality to Dynamic Resource Allocation and allows DRA drivers to report device health directly into a Pod's .status field, which can be viewed via kubectl. The new feature introduces a gRPC service called DRAResourceHealth, which streams device health updates to the Kubelet.

[### Announcing Rust 1.90.0 (3 minute read)](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/09/18/Rust-1.90.0/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Rust 1.90.0 introduces LLD as the default linker on Linux (x86\_64-unknown-linux-gnu) for faster builds, adds native cargo publish --workspace support, and demotes the x86\_64-apple-darwin target to Tier 2 due to Apple's shift away from Intel Macs. The release also stabilizes new APIs and const contexts for math and slice operations while continuing broad platform and tooling improvements.

[### Vulnerability Remediation: Process & Best Practices (18 minute read)](https://spacelift.io/blog/vulnerability-remediation?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Security engineers face an overwhelming volume of vulnerability alerts across cloud environments, making it impossible to remediate everything. Effective vulnerability remediation requires a risk-based strategy that prioritizes high-impact weaknesses, supported by continuous monitoring, automation, tracking, and best practices to reduce exposure and maintain trust.

[### How Maintainer Burnout Is Causing a Kubernetes Security Disaster (5 minute read)](https://thenewstack.io/how-maintainer-burnout-is-causing-a-kubernetes-security-disaster/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes External Secrets Operator has been frozen due to severe maintainer burnout, leaving only one active maintainer and halting new features, bug fixes, and security patches until at least five maintainers are in place. This crisis highlights the risks of under-supported open source projects, as ESO is a critical tool for Kubernetes security, and recovery may take six months or longer.

[### Simplify AWS Lambda Deployments Using GitHub Actions (5 minute read)](https://dev.to/aws-builders/simplify-aws-lambda-deployments-using-github-actions-43om?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AWS introduced a GitHub Action that enables direct deployment of Lambda functions, removing the need for custom scripts and manual configuration. The action supports declarative YAML setup, automatic packaging, and secure OIDC-based IAM integration, making serverless deployments faster and more reliable.

[### Configuration files are user interfaces (6 minute read)](https://ochagavia.nl/blog/configuration-files-are-user-interfaces/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Configuration files should be treated as user interfaces rather than plain text, since they directly shape developer experience and usability. This post highlights KSON as a promising alternative to YAML/JSON/TOML, positioned as both a technical solution and a developer movement to make configuration editing intuitive, error-resistant, and human-friendly.
