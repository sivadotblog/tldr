[### Supply Chain Attacks on Linux distributions (7 minute read)](https://fenrisk.com/supply-chain-attacks?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Supply chain attacks in open-source ecosystems, like the XZ Utils backdoor, are complex and resource-intensive, often targeting dependencies to exploit weaknesses. Recent research uncovered vulnerabilities in Fedora's Pagure and openSUSE's Open Build Service, which if exploited, could compromise the entire package infrastructure of these distributions, highlighting the need for improved security measures.

AWS CodeBuild and GitHub Actions can be used to build and store multi-architecture container images for x86 and AWS Graviton-based compute in Amazon ECR. Here is a step-by-step guide for setting up GitHub repositories, configuring AWS permissions, automating the build process, testing the solution, and cleaning up resources.

[### Optimizing by 170,000%(!) by not being silly (3 minute read)](https://ayende.com/blog/202147-A/optimizing-by-170-000-by-not-being-silly?utm_source=tldrdevops)

RavenDB had a long-standing performance issue where compiling LINQ expressions during document serialization caused massive CPU overhead during thread spikes, going unnoticed in benchmarks. A simple fix resulted in a 1,689× speedup, underscoring how even deeply optimized systems can harbor hidden inefficiencies.

Grafana Labs responded to a 150-minute partial outage affecting 25% of Grafana Cloud services. The outage was caused by an unintended consequence of a TLS policy update that led to the removal of load balancers. The root cause was a failure to fully test and limit the blast radius of the change, as the update bypassed the standard "waves" deployment process.

[### Split Queues To Share Cloud Development Environments (4 minute read)](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/03/19/split-queues-to-share-cloud-development-environments/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Mirrord's queue splitting feature allows developers to share a cloud environment while ensuring their local applications only receive relevant queue messages based on configurable filters. This enables multiple developers to work on the same service simultaneously without interfering with each other or disrupting the shared Kubernetes environment.

[### Embedding-Based Retrieval for Airbnb Search (6 minute read)](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/embedding-based-retrieval-for-airbnb-search-aabebfc85839?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Airbnb created an Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) search system to more efficiently narrow down relevant homes from millions of listings. The system used machine learning to map both homes and de-identified search queries into numerical vectors and incorporates query context, improving the relevance of search results, especially for queries with many potential matches.
