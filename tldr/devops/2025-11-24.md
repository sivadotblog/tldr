[### Introducing VPC encryption controls: Enforce encryption in transit within and across VPCs in a Region (7 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-vpc-encryption-controls-enforce-encryption-in-transit-within-and-across-vpcs-in-a-region/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AWS has announced VPC encryption controls, a new Amazon VPC capability that audits and enforces encryption in transit for all traffic within and across VPCs in a Region. With monitor and enforce modes, organizations can gain centralized visibility and control over encryption status, identify resources allowing plaintext traffic, and ensure all future resources are created on compatible Nitro instances.

[### Breaking siloes: How to use cross-store correlations with Grafana (6 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/11/21/breaking-siloes-how-to-use-cross-store-correlations-with-grafana/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana users can now correlate third-party data sources with Grafana Cloud using the correlation feature in Grafana 12.3. Users can jump from a chart to logs or traces with one click. The time range and label values are carried automatically, so there is no copying and pasting or need for new agents.

[### In-place Pod resizing in Kubernetes: How it works and how to use it (12 minute read)](https://palark.com/blog/in-place-pod-resizing-kubernetes/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Kubernetes supports in-place Pod resizing, allowing CPU and memory resources to be updated on running Pods without restarting them, with kubelet and the container runtime handling changes asynchronously. The feature, fully enabled by default in v1.33, includes a resize subresource, status tracking, and policies for restarts. Limitations remain for swap usage, Windows nodes, QoS class changes, and certain container types.

[### Use AI to Boost Developer Productivity (13 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/ai-developer-productivity-workflow/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Software engineers can improve productivity with AI tools by adopting a development process that includes prompting, planning, producing, and refining. This approach involves breaking tasks into actionable chunks, managing context, and using steering documents to guide the AI, ensuring sustainable code and maximum productivity. The habits you build and the workflows you develop will help you stay ahead of the curve as AI tools evolve.

[### Automating Azure DevOps Pipeline Onboarding (7 minute read)](https://arinco.com.au/blog/automating-azure-devops-pipeline-creation/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

This post describes an automated Azure DevOps pipeline that scans a repository for YAML files and imports them all into Azure DevOps automatically, eliminating the need for manual creation. The self-contained PowerShell-based solution preserves folder structure, prevents duplicates, supports dry-run mode, and uses built-in variables for zero configuration setup.

[### Implementing Terraform Drift Detection in Your Workflow (9 minute read)](https://dev.to/devin-rosario/implementing-terraform-drift-detection-in-your-workflow-56op?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Infrastructure drift occurs when live cloud resources diverge from Terraform configurations, causing security gaps, compliance violations, and significant unexpected costs. Implementing continuous drift detection using tools like Terraform plan, Driftctl, or Spacelift enables automated alerts, reconciliation, and code alignment, reducing financial waste, maintaining compliance, and ensuring infrastructure matches declared state.

[### S3 server access logs at scale (14 minute read)](https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2025/09/s3-server-access-logs-at-scale.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Yelp implemented object-level logging on its Amazon S3 buckets to improve data security, troubleshoot permission issues, and identify unused data for deletion, after AWS added essential features like date-based partitioning for S3 server access logs in November 2023. By converting raw logs to parquet format, Yelp reduced storage size by 85% and the number of objects by 99.99%, also using a single AWS account for querying between different accounts. The company uses access-based retention to delete unused objects. It is planning to forward S3 server access logs to Splunk for more efficient troubleshooting in the future.
