[### MCP Security: A Developer's Guide (5 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/mcp-security-explained/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Model Context Protocol has rapidly become a key standard for connecting AI agents with tools and data, but its flexibility introduces serious risks such as command injection, misconfigurations, prompt injection, and supply chain attacks. Docker addresses these challenges with containerized MCP servers, a policy-enforcing Gateway, and a curated Catalog & Toolkit that provide secure defaults, active security controls, and standardized workflows for safer agentic AI development.

[### The golden path: Taming K8s complexity in favour of DevEx (9 minute read)](https://platformengineering.org/blog/the-golden-path-taming-k8s-complexity-in-favour-of-devex?utm_source=tldrdevops)

The golden path approach simplifies Kubernetes by providing opinionated, automated workflows that reduce complexity, standardize deployments, and embed security, observability, and automation from the start. It accelerates delivery and lowers operational overhead while enabling faster iteration and competitive business agility.

[### Empowering Netflix Engineers with Incident Management (6 minute read)](https://netflixtechblog.com/empowering-netflix-engineers-with-incident-management-ebb967871de4?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Netflix shifted incident management from a centralized SRE function to an accessible, company-wide practice by adopting Incident.io and investing in cultural change. The intuitive tooling, internal integrations, and lightweight but consistent processes empowered engineers to declare and manage incidents themselves, driving faster responses and continuous learning across teams.

[### Beyond Winning: Spotify's Experiments with Learning Framework (12 minute read)](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2025/9/spotifys-experiments-with-learning-framework?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Spotify's experimentation platform, Confidence, uses the Experiments with Learning (EwL) metric to measure experiment success by whether experiments yielded enough valid information to inform product decisions. Spotify's learning rate is ~64%, but its win rate is ~12%, which emphasizes that most value comes from understanding what doesn't work or detecting regressions, not just shipping improvements.

[### MCP Horror Stories: The Drive-By Localhost Breach (10 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/mpc-horror-stories-cve-2025-49596-local-host-breach/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

A critical vulnerability, CVE-2025-49596, was discovered in MCP Inspector, a debugging tool with over 78,000 weekly downloads, turning it into a drive-by attack platform that compromises developer machines upon visiting a malicious website. The vulnerability, which scores 9.4 out of 10 on the CVSS scale, allows attackers to gain control of the MCP Inspector interface and access private files by exploiting a browser implementation flaw where browsers incorrectly treat the IP address 0.0.0.0 as equivalent to localhost.
