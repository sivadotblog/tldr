[### The future of observability is OpenTelemetry-native (Sponsor)](https://www.dash0.com/blog/opentelemetry-native-the-future-of-observability?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=devops_primary_1&amp;utm_content=OpenTelemetry-native:_The_future_of_Observability)

OpenTelemetry is the second-largest CNCF project by # of contributors, evolving as the solid foundation of modern observability. Industry adoption has not yet matched OpenTelemetry's maturity due to complexity and vendor lock-in of the previous generation of observability solutions.

But this is changing, fast.

Dash0 has built a [modern, easy-to-use OpenTelemetry-native observability tool](https://www.dash0.com?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=devops_primary_1&utm_content=OpenTelemetry-native:_The_future_of_Observability), using open standards to keep you flexible and hit the ground running.

Making OpenTelemetry easy to adopt.
