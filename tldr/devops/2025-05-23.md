[### Labeling a root cause is predicting the future, poorly (3 minute read)](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/05/15/labeling-a-root-cause-is-predicting-the-future-poorly/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Root cause analysis relies on the flawed assumption that we can predict which contributing factors will cause future incidents. Focusing narrowly on a so-called root cause risks missing valuable signals from other contributing factors, undermining efforts to improve future system resilience.

[### The pain points of VPNs in enterprise IT (5 minute read)](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/the-pain-points-of-vpns-in-enterprise-it?utm_source=tldrdevops)

VPNs provide secure remote network access but fall short in enforcing least-privilege access, protecting credentials, enabling detailed session monitoring, and offering a seamless user experience in dynamic cloud environments. Identity-based solutions like HashiCorp Boundary address these gaps by enabling fine-grained access control, credential injection, and simplified workflows without exposing network complexity to users.

[### Another Tale of go.mod Bloat (3 minute read)](https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/another-tale-of-gomod-bloat)

While trying to keep the honk ActivityPub server minimal, the author discovered that a single dependency, gofeed, pulled in an unexpectedly large web of unrelated packages, ballooning the release size and causing brittle tooling issues like go doc requiring network access. By rewriting a small bit of XML parsing code themselves, they eliminated gofeed, halved the release tarball size, and reinforced their belief that functionality should justify complexity.
