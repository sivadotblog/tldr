[### Open Letter: Let Developers Build ‚Äì Let Technology Handle Security (Sponsor)](https://qwiet.ai/open-letter-let-developers-build-let-technology-handle-security/?utm_content=tldr&amp;utm_campaign=tldr_developer_ad2)

Developers should focus on building innovative solutions, not managing security complexities.

Traditional security tools often overwhelm teams with false positives and slow down development. It's time for a change.

Modern AI-driven security platforms should integrate efficiently into your development process, providing [accurate vulnerability detection and automated fixes.](https://qwiet.ai/open-letter-let-developers-build-let-technology-handle-security/?utm_content=tldr&utm_campaign=tldr_developer_ad2)

A shift-everywhere approach reduces developer fatigue, accelerates secure code delivery, and ensures that security becomes an invisible, trusted partner in your workflow.

Embrace [the future of development where technology handles security](https://qwiet.ai/open-letter-let-developers-build-let-technology-handle-security/?utm_content=tldr&utm_campaign=tldr_developer_ad2), allowing developers to build without compromise.[üëâ Read the full open letter](https://qwiet.ai/open-letter-let-developers-build-let-technology-handle-security/?utm_content=tldr&utm_campaign=tldr_developer_ad2)

### Opinions & Tutorials

[### Systems Correctness Practices at Amazon Web Services (14 minute read)](https://cacm.acm.org/practice/systems-correctness-practices-at-amazon-web-services/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

AWS uses formal and semi-formal methods like TLA+, the P language, property-based testing, and fault injection to ensure system correctness, uncover bugs early, and validate optimizations. These practices boost performance and reliability at scale, though adoption challenges remain due to steep learning curves and tool complexity.

[### Kubernetes Multi-Tenancy: Considerations & Approaches (20 minute read)](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-multi-tenancy?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Multi-tenancy in Kubernetes allows multiple users or teams to share a single cluster, improving resource efficiency through namespace isolation, RBAC, and network policies. Implementing this architecture requires careful setup of resource quotas, access controls, and optional use of virtual clusters to balance performance, security, and operational complexity.

[### How to import Prometheus-style alerts and recording rules to Grafana-managed alerts and recording rules (4 minute read)](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/05/27/how-to-import-prometheus-style-alerts-and-recording-rules-to-grafana-managed-alerts-and-recording-rules/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Grafana 12 now allows users to import existing Prometheus, Grafana Loki, or Grafana Mimir rule files directly into Grafana-managed alerts through the UI, streamlining the migration of data source alerts.

[### We rewrote large parts of our API in Go using AI (6 minute read)](https://turso.tech/blog/we-rewrote-large-parts-of-our-api-in-go?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Turso rewrote its Go API using AI to handle one billion databases, replacing memory-heavy designs with an SQLite-backed cache and LRU layer. This cut memory use, improved startup times, and enabled scalable, persistent performance.

[### GitHub App vs. OAuth for Terraform integration (4 minute read)](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/github-app-vs-oauth-for-terraform-integration?utm_source=tldrdevops)

GitHub App offers centralized control, persistent access across users, and automatic webhook management, making it suitable for organizations prioritizing security, scalability, and independence from individual users. GitHub OAuth allows per-project access control and multiple VCS connections per Terraform organization but risks losing connectivity if the user who created the integration leaves.

[### Building a Distributed Cache for S3 (25 minute read)](https://clickhouse.com/blog/building-a-distributed-cache-for-s3?utm_source=tldrdevops)

ClickHouse introduced a distributed cache for its cloud service, enabling fast, shared access to hot table data across all compute nodes. By decoupling caching from compute and replacing isolated local caches with a high-throughput, low-latency shared layer, ClickHouse dramatically improves query performance, cold start times, and elasticity, outperforming even SSD-backed setups without relying on local disks.
