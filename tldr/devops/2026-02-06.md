[### 94% of developers and product leaders would consider switching SaaS vendors for stronger agentic AI functionality (Sponsor)](https://www.nylas.com/agentic-ai-report-2026/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredemail&amp;utm_campaign=FY26Q1-TLDR-AgenticAI&amp;utm_content=)

Agentic AI is becoming a buying decision, not a feature. In a survey of 1,000+ developers and product leaders, we found that agentic AI is already acting as a switching event across the modern tech stack.

The [Developer's Guide to Agentic AI 2026](https://www.nylas.com/agentic-ai-report-2026/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=sponsoredemail&utm_campaign=FY26Q1-TLDR-AgenticAI&utm_content=) report breaks down:

* The timeline: Why 85% say agentic AI will be table stakes within three years
* Production over hype: How 67% of teams are already shipping today (mostly internal ops)
* The bottlenecks: Why security approvals (50%) and integration complexity (44%) are the biggest blockers to scale

[### Self-Optimizing Football Chatbot Guided by Domain Experts on Databricks (10 minute read)](https://www.databricks.com/blog/self-optimizing-football-chatbot-guided-domain-experts-databricks?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Databricks has unveiled an architecture for continuously improving AI agents, exemplified by an American Football Defensive Coordinator Assistant, which leverages MLflow's `align()` and `optimize\_prompts()` functions to integrate domain expert feedback for automated prompt refinement and enhanced performance. This system encodes human expertise directly into the agent, providing situation-aware insights for coaches and a reusable framework for other domain-specific AI applications.

[### GitHub Actions Is Slowly Killing Your Engineering Team (14 minute read)](https://www.iankduncan.com/engineering/2026-02-05-github-actions-killing-your-team/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

GitHub Actions wins by convenience, not quality, and its slow UI, brittle YAML DSL, opaque permissions, untrustworthy marketplace, and rented compute quietly drain engineering time and morale. Buildkite, by contrast, keeps config simple, puts real logic in real code, lets teams own fast, debuggable infrastructure, and feels like a CI tool built by people who actually suffer through CI every day.

[### Owning a $5M data center (7 minute read)](https://blog.comma.ai/datacenter/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Comma.ai runs all of its ML training, storage, and metrics on a self-owned, in-office data center, which it estimates cost about $5M to build and operate versus $25M+ for equivalent cloud usage. The data center uses self-built GPU servers, non-redundant high-throughput SSD storage, Slurm-managed compute, PyTorch distributed training, and custom lightweight infrastructure to efficiently support large-scale model training and experimentation.
