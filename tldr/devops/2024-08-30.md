[### Switch off Virtual Machines on a schedule using an Azure Tag (6 minute read)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/switch-off-virtual-machines-on-a-schedule-using-an-azure-tag/ba-p/4207182?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Controlling the costs of running virtual machines (VMs) in Azure can be difficult, particularly when VMs remain active outside of business hours. A practical approach to address this is by scheduling automatic shutdowns with the help of Azure tags through a PowerShell script that leverages an Azure tag to set and implement shutdown schedules for your VMs.

[### Firewall rules: not as secure as you think (8 minute read)](https://www.haskellforall.com/2024/08/firewall-rules-not-as-secure-as-you.html?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Firewall rules can be bypassed using techniques like proxies and reverse tunnels, allowing remote software management in restricted networks. This article discusses techniques, including using forward proxies, TLS-terminating reverse proxies, and tools like corkscrew, to enable SSH access over HTTPS connections, even with minimal firewall permissions. These methods are detailed in a repository that provides practical guides for implementing them to access internal hosts behind strict firewalls.

[### The queueing shell game (5 minute read)](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2024/08/21/the-queueing-shell-game/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Queues are unavoidable in systems where more entities need access to a resource than can be served simultaneously. Even if you try to eliminate queues from your architecture, you'll only end up shifting them elsewhere, such as into network stacks, web servers, load balancers, or even in the minds of your users.

[### RETINAS: Real-Time Infrastructure Accounting for Sustainability (7 minute read)](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/08/26/data-infrastructure/retinas-real-time-infrastructure-accounting-for-sustainability/?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Meta's RETINAS initiative introduces a metric for real-time server fleet utilization effectiveness, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize infrastructure and reduce Scope 3 emissions in pursuit of its 2030 net zero goal.

[### How we sped up Notion in the browser with WASM SQLite (10 minute read)](https://www.notion.so/blog/how-we-sped-up-notion-in-the-browser-with-wasm-sqlite?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Notion enhanced its web app's performance by integrating SQLite caching with WebAssembly, reducing page navigation times by up to 33% in regions like India. Using Web Workers and the Origin Private File System, its team implemented a SharedWorker architecture to manage SQLite access across multiple tabs, solving concurrency issues and avoiding browser limitations related to cross-origin isolation. This approach led to significant improvements without data corruption or dependency on specific browser features.
