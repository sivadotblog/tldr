If you're reading this, odds are you're trying to ship a product and keep it running.

Infra's getting harder, apps are more complex, and you can't ship fast enough. You're buried in YAML & Terraform. There's a better way. Northflank gives you the right abstractions so your team can ship complex apps, from preview to prod, without cobbling together 15 tools.

We make Kubernetes work for your developers, not the other way around.

* [Deploy and scale any workload](https://northflank.com/tldr) (services, GPUs, databases, jobs) on any cloud and on-prem.
* All your environments, from preview to production, with built-in CI/CD.
* First-class developer experience: UI, CLI, API, GitOps, and reusable templates.

üß† ‚ÄúIt's the ideal platform to deploy containers in our VPC, avoiding the brain damage of big cloud and Kubernetes.‚Äù ‚Äî David Cramer, Sentry

[### How to Sync Anything (16 minute read)](https://neighbourhood.ie/blog/2025/04/06/how-to-sync-anything?utm_source=tldrdevops)

Ad-hoc replication often leads to inconsistent data due to lossy change detection, asynchronous retries, and lack of a clear sync model. A structured, idempotent diff-and-patch approach provides a reliable foundation for replication. CouchDB offers built-in tools‚Äîlike the changes feed‚Äîto support this model effectively.
