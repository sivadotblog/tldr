[### What comes after the corporate firewall? (Sponsor)](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/network-control?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=sponsor&amp;utm_campaign=network_control_q3_25&amp;utm_content=network_control&amp;utm_term=newsletter#faq)

The corporate firewall is a relic of bygone times. With employees working from coffee shops, airports, and home networks, traditional perimeter security leaves your endpoints exposed to unmanaged devices and compromised networks.

[ThreatLocker Network Control](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/network-control?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=sponsor&utm_campaign=network_control_q3_25&utm_content=network_control&utm_term=newsletter) brings the firewall to each endpoint with dynamic ACLs that automatically adjust based on location. Unlike VPNs that route through central points, it creates [direct, secure endpoint-to-endpoint connections](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/network-control?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=sponsor&utm_campaign=network_control_q3_25&utm_content=network_control&utm_term=newsletter).

⚡ Create custom policies to open ports on demand for approved devices and users.

⚡ Ports auto-close within 5 minutes when not in use.

⚡ Manage all endpoint firewalls from one console.

✅ No IT tickets needed.

[### Protecting Against Typosquatting With Website Typo Protection in Microsoft Edge (4 minute read)](https://petervanderwoude.nl/post/protecting-against-typosquatting-with-website-typo-protection-in-microsoft-edge/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Website typo protection is an automatically enabled, typosquatting protection in Microsoft Edge. Upon typing a misspelling of a common domain in Edge, the user will get a notification of the potential typo, and the address bar will include a “Not Secure” badge (similar to when visiting a website without HTTPS). This post provides details for configuring protection if it isn't enabled and includes screenshots of the notifications.

[### Post-Quantum TLS in Python (5 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/post-quantum-tls-in-python/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

In preparation for the creation of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC), NIST selected three post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic standards. This post details how to test hybrid TLS, where classical keys are used in combination with PQ ML-KEM keys, in Python on AWS. boto3, the Python SDK for AWS, relies upon the Python `ssl` module, which in turn relies on OpenSSL, which added support for hybrid TLS in version 3.5.
