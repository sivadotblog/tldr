Most "AI for security" tools don't actually make your workflows faster or easier. Sumo Logic's [Dojo AI](https://www.sumologic.com/blog/welcome-dojo-ai-agents-soc?utm_medium=email&utm_source=TLDR&utm_term=cloud-siem&utm_id=701VK00000KhKeHYAV&utm_campaign=20251204-global-awsmp-TLDR-primary) is a different beast, deploying specialized agents that work together to triage alerts, explain what triggered them, and write queries for you.

[### Everest Ransomware Claims Breach at Nissan, Says 900GB of Data Stolen (2 minute read)](https://hackread.com/everest-ransomware-nissan-data-breach/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The Everest ransomware group claimed to have breached Nissan Motor Corporation, posting screenshots on their dark web leak site showing directory structures with 900GB of allegedly stolen data, including dealership information, financial records, and operational documentation in .csv, .txt, .pgp, and .xls formats. The group issued a five-day deadline before public release, continuing their aggressive 2025-2026 campaign that has targeted ASUS, Chrysler, AT&T, and other major organizations. This marks Nissan's third significant security incident in recent years, following the Qilin ransomware attack on its design subsidiary and the 2023 breach affecting over 100,000 individuals.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### OID-See: Giving Your OAuth Apps the Side-Eye (26 minute read)](https://cirriustech.co.uk/blog/oidsee/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

OAuth in Microsoft Entra creates complex webs of apps, permissions, and identities that are hard to reason about with tables alone, so modelling everything as a graph reveals abuse paths such as impersonation and long‑lived access that would otherwise stay hidden. OID-See uses Microsoft Graph to map service principals, delegated scopes, app roles, ownership, assignments, and reply URLs into a graph-backed analysis. It then layers scoring and enrichment to highlight risky apps, misleading Microsoft-shaped metadata, and dangerous patterns like broad reachability, wildcard redirects, and stale credentials.

[### Stopping Kill Signals Against Your eBPF Programs (5 minute read)](https://substack.bomfather.dev/p/stopping-kill-signals-against-your?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

When malicious processes gain elevated privileges, they can disable eBPF agents, weakening a system's security posture. To prevent this, defenders can hook security\_task\_kill to prevent kill signals from reaching the eBPF agent. However, this also blocks any kill signals sent by defenders, such as to upgrade the agent. Defenders can instead set the eBPF hook to accept a signed signal with a nonce for restarts.

[### EventBridge Pattern Matching: A Field Guide (7 minute read)](https://deceptiq.com/blog/eventbridge-pattern-matching-guide?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

EventBridge JSONs can become very complex quickly. AWS provides very little documentation to help parse them. Fields at the same level of the JSON are ANDed together, whereas values in an array are ORed together. If a user wants to apply an OR to two fields, they can use the $or operator. However, users should be careful when nesting $ors, as each branch gets expanded into additional sub-patterns that can become contradictory or complex to debug. This post also covers other operators and how to combine them to develop complex Boolean logic.

[### GoBruteforcer Botnet Targets Crypto Project Databases by Exploiting Weak Credentials (4 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/gobruteforcer-botnet-targets-crypto.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Check Point Research identified an upgraded GoBruteforcer campaign targeting cryptocurrency and blockchain project databases, exploiting weak credentials spread via AI-generated server-deployment tutorials and legacy XAMPP stacks that expose FTP and phpMyAdmin interfaces. The Golang-based botnet features an obfuscated IRC bot, dynamic credential lists that include crypto-focused usernames, and a module that queries TRON blockchain addresses for non-zero balances. Separately, GreyNoise observed 80,469 sessions over 11 days from threat actors systematically probing 73+ LLM endpoints across major AI providers, hunting for misconfigured proxy servers that leak API access.
