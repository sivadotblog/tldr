### Strategies & Tactics

[### Detect Secrets in GitLab CI Logs using ggshield and Bring Your Own Source (4 minute read)](https://blog.gitguardian.com/detect-secrets-in-gitlab-ci-logs/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

GitGuardian demonstrates how to automatically scan GitLab CI/CD pipeline logs for secrets using ggshield and their Bring Your Own Source initiative, addressing a critical but often overlooked attack vector where sensitive data like environment variables, API responses, and temporary credentials are exposed in build logs. The solution involves creating a custom Docker image with enhanced ggshield capabilities, configuring secure token storage via HashiCorp Vault, and implementing an automated scanning script that processes all pipeline job logs and creates incidents in the GitGuardian dashboard. This approach provides comprehensive secrets detection across the entire DevOps lifecycle, catching runtime secrets that traditional source code scanning misses while maintaining zero friction for developers.

[### AWS AgentCore: The Overlooked Privilege Escalation Path in Bedrock's AI Tooling (6 minute read)](https://sonraisecurity.com/blog/aws-agentcore-privilege-escalation-bedrock-scp-fix/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

AWS Bedrock AgentCore is a collection of tools that assist in deploying and scaling AI agents. AgentCore provides the ability to launch Code Interpreters, which run code in a sandboxed environment and can be customized to have access to AWS credentials to perform actions on AWS resources. Custom Code Interpreters cannot be protected with resource policies and only emit CloudTrail data events, presenting a tempting privilege escalation vector for attackers.

[### Lateral Movement - BitLocker (8 minute read)](https://ipurple.team/2025/08/04/lateral-movement-bitlocker/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

BitLocker is a full disk encryption feature for Windows that protects data at rest by encrypting full volumes. This post outlines a privilege escalation or lateral movement technique that uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to hijack specific COM objects of BitLocker using remote manipulation of BitLocker registry keys to execute code under the user's context on a target host. The post also discusses detection opportunities for this attack and Sigma and Windows Defender for Endpoint queries to detect them.

[### Inboxfuscation (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Permiso-io-tools/Inboxfuscation?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Inboxfuscation is an advanced inbox rule obfuscation framework for Microsoft Exchange environments. The tool provides sophisticated Unicode-based obfuscation techniques to create stealthy inbox rules that can evade basic detection while maintaining functionality.

[### YASA (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/antgroup/YASA-Engine?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

YASA (Yet Another Static Analyzer) is an open-source static program analysis project. Its core innovation lies in a unified intermediate representation called the Unified Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST), designed to support multiple programming languages. Built on top of UAST, YASA provides a highly accurate static analysis framework. Users can extend its capabilities by writing custom checkers to perform various program analysis tasks—such as AST queries, data flow analysis, and function call graph analysis—and expose functionality through SDK, declarative query language (QL), or MCP.

[### Pyarmor (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Pyarmor is a command-line tool designed for obfuscating Python scripts, binding obfuscated scripts to specific machines, and setting expiration dates for obfuscated scripts.

[### WatchGuard Warns of Critical Vulnerability in Firebox Firewalls (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/watchguard-warns-of-critical-vulnerability-in-firebox-firewalls/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

WatchGuard has released security updates to address a critical (CVSS 9.3) remote code execution vulnerability impacting its Firebox firewalls. The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write on devices configured to use IKEv2 VPN. Devices that have deleted the vulnerable configuration but still have a branch office VPN to a static gateway peer configured may also be vulnerable.

[### Check Point acquires Lakera to build a unified AI security stack (4 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4058653/check-point-acquires-lakera-to-build-a-unified-ai-security-stack.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Check Point has announced plans to acquire AI security platform Lakera in Q4 2025 to strengthen enterprise defenses against emerging AI threats like prompt injection attacks, data leaks through LLMs, and model manipulation as organizations rapidly adopt generative AI and autonomous agents. Lakera's AI-native runtime protection technology boasts 98% detection rates with sub-50ms latency and less than 0.5% false positives, addressing gaps that traditional cybersecurity tools cannot handle in real-time AI environments.

[### Meet ShadowLeak: ‘Impossible to detect' data theft using AI (8 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4059606/meet-shadowleak-impossible-to-detect-data-theft-using-ai.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Researchers at Radware discovered a vulnerability called ShadowLeak that exploits OpenAI's ChatGPT through indirect prompt injection attacks. Hidden email instructions can trick the AI into stealing sensitive data like credit card numbers and names from users' inboxes. The attack bypasses ChatGPT's security protections by encoding stolen data in Base64 and exfiltrating it directly through OpenAI's servers via the agent's browsing tool, making it nearly impossible to detect since it doesn't go through the client interface. This attack represents a significant escalation from previous client-side prompt injection attacks, as the data theft occurs entirely on the backend without any visible signs to the user.
