### Strategies & Tactics

[### Evaluating AI Agents in Security Operations (6 minute read)](https://cotool.ai/blog/evaluating-gpt-5-1-claude-opus-4-5-and-gemini-3-pro-ai-agents-in-security-operations?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Cotool tested an AI agent's ability to solve security operations tasks using the Splunk BOTSv3 dataset and frontier models from Claude, OpenAI, and Gemini. Cotool found that while GPT-5.1 and Opus 4.5 achieved the top accuracy at 63%, Opus was 3x more expensive than GPT-5.1 but also completed tasks in half the wall-clock time of any other model. The Gemini models performed notably poorly on the tasks and failed to complete several tasks.

[### The Exploitation of Legitimate Remote Access Tools in Modern Ransomware Campaigns (8 minute read)](https://www.seqrite.com/blog/exploiting-legitimate-remote-access-tools-in-ransomware-campaigns/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Ransomware operators often use remote access tools such as AnyDesk and UltraViewer to maintain persistence, execute remote tasks, and transfer files while avoiding detection. Their typical attack involves using stolen credentials to compromise an employee, then either hijacking existing tools or installing legitimate remote access software, followed by establishing persistence, escalating privileges, and disabling security tools. Subsequently, they deploy payloads, move laterally within the network, and finally execute their ransomware attack.

[### Smile, You're on Camera: A Live Stream from Inside Lazarus Group's IT Workers Scheme (20 minute read)](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/lazarus-group-it-workers-investigation/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Researchers trapped North Korean operatives from Lazarus Group's Famous Chollima division inside an extended ANY.RUN sandbox environments, documenting their full operational workflow for infiltrating Western companies as remote IT workers. The operators recruit developers via GitHub spam. They offer 20-35% salary cuts in exchange for using victims' identities and laptops for job applications, relying on AI interview tools, AstrillVPN, and remote access software rather than malware. Poor operational security allowed researchers to delay, monitor, and ultimately expose the scheme targeting the finance, crypto, and healthcare sectors.
