[### Test security rules like code with the Fastly WAF Simulator (Sponsor)](https://www.fastly.com/blog/security-without-speed-bumps-why-waf-simulator-transforms-devsecops?utm_campaign=NAMER_Display-Website-Visits_TLDR-Infosec-Subscribers_EN_Digital_Brand-Awareness_&amp;utm_source=TLDR&amp;utm_medium=ema)

For developers, treating is sacrosanct. In security, it's too often an afterthought - WAF rules are only validated during pentesting... or in an actual attack.

Fastly's new [WAF Simulator](https://www.fastly.com/blog/security-without-speed-bumps-why-waf-simulator-transforms-devsecops?utm_campaign=NAMER_Display-Website-Visits_TLDR-Infosec-Subscribers_EN_Digital_Brand-Awareness_&utm_source=TLDR&utm_medium=ema) lets you validate WAF rules with integrated, continuous, automated security testing that doesn't interrupt the development flow:

* Request/response simulation to test expected rule behavior
* Visibility into rule-based signals: bot analysis, business logic enforcement, and block status codes
* Custom rule validation with CVE tagging or complex logic

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Using Tactical and Strategic Analysis to Track Threat Actor Targeting (9 minute read)](https://vertex.link/blogs/tactical-strategic-pt2/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

This blog explores how intelligence analysts can distinguish objective victimology from subjective threat actor motivations when reporting on “targeted” sectors. Analysts can ensure consistent, data-driven threat assessments by leveraging standardized industry classifications (ISIC, NACE, and NAICS) and linking tactical evidence to strategic assertions in Synapse. Storm queries help validate that strategic conclusions about targeting are backed by concrete, observable evidence.

[### Safeguarding VS Code Against Prompt Injections (9 minute read)](https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/safeguarding-vs-code-against-prompt-injections/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Prompt injection attacks in VS Code's Copilot Chat could allow malicious actors to leak data or execute code by embedding crafted prompts in GitHub issues. GitHub responded with security improvements like enhanced confirmation flows, tool execution restrictions, and sandboxed environments. The post also recommends Workspace Trust and containerization as defenses, emphasizing the need for ongoing protection as LLM threats evolve.

[### Raising Security With Organization-Wide YubiKey (FIDO2) in Entra ID (17 minute read)](https://www.huntandhackett.com/blog/raising-security-with-yubikey?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Hunt & Hackett details its end-to-end YubiKey FIDO2 rollout for Microsoft Entra ID, using phased conditional access enforcement to mandate phishing-resistant hardware authentication for specific users and actions. Its approach includes automated Temporary Access Pass (TAP) provisioning for onboarding and fallback, access packages for exceptions, and robust monitoring of breakglass accounts. Key lessons include session token control and cross-platform testing prior to full enforcement.

### Launches & Tools

[### Some APIs Keep Secrets. Yours Might Not. (Sponsor)](https://www.intruder.io/research/broken-authorization-apis-autoswagger?utm_source=tldrinfosec&amp;utm_medium=p_referral&amp;utm_campaign=global%7Cfixed%7Cautoswagger_26_08_25)

Three years after the Optus breach exposed millions of customer records, [Intruder's](https://www.intruder.io/?utm_source=tldrinfosec&utm_medium=p_referral&utm_campaign=global%7Cfixed%7Cautoswagger_26_08_25) research team went hunting for the same broken API authorization flaws. They found:

* Microsoft credentials sitting in an unauthenticated config endpoint.
* 60,000+ Salesforce records with PII completely exposed.
* SQL injection on a multinational company's training API.

…all discoverable because these companies documented their APIs publicly. ([See the actual examples here](https://www.intruder.io/research/broken-authorization-apis-autoswagger?utm_source=tldrinfosec&utm_medium=p_referral&utm_campaign=global%7Cfixed%7Cautoswagger_26_08_25))

These are basic weaknesses that even an unskilled attacker could exploit, but are equally easy to miss. Intruder's Autoswagger is a free tool that helps you avoid these simple-but-catastrophic mistakes.

[### Azure AppHunter (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/8ales/Azure-AppHunter?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Azure AppHunter is an open-source PowerShell tool designed for security researchers, red teamers, and defenders. It identifies excessive or risky permissions granted to Azure Service Principals, helping teams uncover misconfigurations and enforce least privilege.

[### EntraRoleReaper (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/FrodeHus/EntraRoleReaper?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

EntraRoleReaper audits Entra ID users' role assignments by comparing them to actual operations performed over a selected time period. The tool supports least privilege reviews and helps reduce unnecessary role sprawl in Microsoft Entra ID environments.

[### AntiDebug (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/haxo-games/AntiDebug?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

AntiDebug is a terminal-based tool for testing x86\_64 Windows anti-debugging techniques. It provides a hands-on environment for analyzing and understanding various methods malware may use to detect or evade debuggers.

Phishing campaigns are now embedding AI prompt injection commands within emails to manipulate automated analysis tools while simultaneously targeting users with credential harvesting tactics. These hidden prompts instruct AI models to enter reasoning loops rather than flag malicious content, increasing the risk of delayed detection or false negatives in SOC workflows. This dual-track approach highlights attackers' growing awareness of AI-based defenses and their efforts to bypass both human and machine detection systems.

[### Intent Over Tactics: A CISO's Guide to Protecting Your Crown Jewels (10 minute read)](https://tldrsec.com/p/intent-over-tactics-crown-jewels?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

This article outlines a strategic approach to security by identifying and protecting your organization's “crown jewels,” the most critical assets, systems, or people. These may include intellectual property, CI/CD pipelines, backup infrastructure, or key personnel. Instead of reacting to specific attacker tactics, the approach emphasizes understanding attacker intent and designing layered defenses around the assets most likely to be targeted. The process is recursive, expanding protections outward from the crown jewel.

[### Docker Explained: Finally Understand Containers Without Losing Your Mind (7 minute read)](https://marcosdedeu.substack.com/p/docker-explained-finally-understand?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

This guide breaks down Docker in plain terms: containers package code with dependencies to avoid the “works on my machine” problem. It covers key concepts like `Dockerfile` “recipes,” `docker build` commands for creating layered images, registries for storing images, and `docker run` for execution. Containers offer faster, more consistent, isolated, and efficient environments for running applications across systems.
