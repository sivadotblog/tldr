[### 800% spike in stolen credentials detected in Flashpoint's Global Threat Intelligence Index (Sponsor)](https://go.flashpoint.io/gtii-midyear-report?utm_campaign=Resource_RP_GTII_2025_Midyear&amp;utm_source=tldrinfosec&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;sfcampaign_id=701Rc00000SPd2sIAD)

Drawing from [+3.6 petabytes of data](https://go.flashpoint.io/gtii-midyear-report?utm_campaign=Resource_RP_GTII_2025_Midyear&utm_source=tldrinfosec&utm_medium=newsletter&sfcampaign_id=701Rc00000SPd2sIAD), Flashpoint's 2025 Midyear Threat Index reveals a sharp acceleration in malicious activity and spotlights critical threats defenders must prioritize.

This intelligence briefing goes beyond public sources like NVD (which has a 42,000 vulnerability backlog) to deliver [proprietary insights from illicit marketplaces, ransomware blogs, and stealer logs](https://go.flashpoint.io/gtii-midyear-report?utm_campaign=Resource_RP_GTII_2025_Midyear&utm_source=tldrinfosec&utm_medium=newsletter&sfcampaign_id=701Rc00000SPd2sIAD) that security teams can't get anywhere else.

The report highlights cascading threats (infostealers => billions of exposed credentials), why "identity" has become the dominant attack vector, and which emerging ransomware groups are filling LockBit's void.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Attackers Exploit Link-Wrapping Services to Steal Microsoft 365 Logins (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/attackers-exploit-link-wrapping-services-to-steal-microsoft-365-logins/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Cloudflare's Email Security team observed a new campaign in which threat actors abuse link-wrapping services from Proofpoint and Intermedia to phish users for Microsoft 365 credentials. Attackers abused Proofpoint link-wrapping in various ways, including multi-tiered redirect abuse with URL shorteners via compromised accounts. In the Intermedia campaign, threat actors sent a message impersonating a “Zix” secure message notification or a Teams notification that would redirect users to a fake login page to harvest Teams credentials.

[### CL-STA-0969 Installs Covert Malware in Telecom Networks During 10-Month Espionage Campaign (5 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/cl-sta-0969-installs-covert-malware-in.html?m=1&utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Chinese state-sponsored threat actor CL-STA-0969 conducted a 10-month espionage campaign that targeted Southeast Asian telecom networks. The campaign used custom malware, including AuthDoor, GTPDOOR, and ChronosRAT, to enable remote control and location tracking. The group deployed advanced evasion techniques, including DNS tunneling and traffic routing through compromised mobile operators, while maintaining high operational security. There was no evidence of data exfiltration despite the attackers installing multiple backdoors and scanning tools across critical telecommunications infrastructure.

[### Critical Alert: Akira Ransomware Surge Targets SonicWall Firewalls (3 minute read)](https://www.criticalpathsecurity.com/critical-alert-akira-ransomware-surge-targets-sonicwall-firewalls/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Akira ransomware attacks targeting SonicWall SSL VPN connections have surged since July. Exploiting CVE-2024-40766 (CVSS 9.3) and unpatched SonicOS devices with disabled MFA, attackers rapidly escalate from VPN access to system encryption within hours, affecting hundreds of thousands of devices across multiple SonicWall generations. Organizations must immediately patch to the latest firmware, enable MFA on all VPN accounts, and restrict firewall management access to trusted IP ranges.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Kubernetes Security Fundamentals: Authorization (7 minute read)](https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/kubernetes-security-fundamentals-part-4/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Kubernetes handles authorization by utilizing multiple authorization providers in the cluster requested in the order specified to the kube-server as flags on startup. Each provider can explicitly approve or deny the request or respond with “no opinion.” If all providers respond “no opinion,” the request is denied. Providers include AlwaysAllow and AlwaysDeny, which allow or deny every request; Node Authorizer, which restricts the access of the kubelet user; Attribute-Based Access Controls (ABAC), which enables cluster-admins to define authorization rules based on the request's characteristics statically; Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC), which is the most commonly used provider and maps permissions to roles; and Webhook, which is widely used in cloud provider clusters like AKS, GKE, and EKS.

[### Exploiting Trust: How Signed Kernel Drivers Fuel Modern Kernel Level Attacks on Windows (11 minute read)](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/kernel-driver-threats/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

An emerging pattern in kernel level attacks is to use a signed kernel loader to load a signed second stage kernel driver or reflectively load an unsigned kernel driver. These signed drivers are often signed via the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (WHCP). The WHCP requires an extended validation (EV) certificate, which is designed to increase the security of the program. However, the EV certificate application process requires little human interaction, and there are dark web sellers of EV code-signing certificates.

[### Silent Push CEO on cybercrime takedowns: 'It's an ongoing cat-and-mouse game' (3 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/03/silent_push_ceo_talks_cybercrime/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

In this interview, Silent Push CEO Ken Bagnall discusses tracking Funnull, a Philippines-based company providing infrastructure for financial scams that cost US victims $200 million. The firm maps criminal networks for law enforcement but faces challenges when groups adapt to surveillance. Bagnall compares state-tolerated cybercrime to historical privateering, requiring national-level responses.

### Launches & Tools

[### Compose Your Way With Provider Services (3 minute read)](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-compose-with-provider-services/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Docker Compose has announced the release of Provider services, which enables users to extend the capabilities of Docker Compose files by calling provider plugins that can interact with external services. This post includes an example of how to use the Telepresence traffic manager for a Kubernetes cluster.

[### Playbook-NG (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/cisagov/playbook-ng?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Playbook-NG is a stateless web-based application that matches incident findings with countermeasures for adversary containment and eviction. Users can export the results in numerous formats such as JSON, Microsoft Word, Excel, and Markdown. The application does not save information about the users or their inputs. Work is cleared when the user browses off or clears the playbook.

[### Echo (Product Launch)](https://www.echohq.com/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Echo offers CVE-free container base images in a similar space to Chainguard or recently Wiz. Customers simply need to replace their Dockerfile base image with Echo's secure version without any other changes.
