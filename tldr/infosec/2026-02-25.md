### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Iran's MuddyWater Targets Orgs With Fresh Malware as Tensions Mount (4 minute read)](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/iran-muddywater-new-malware-tensions-mount?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Iran's MuddyWater (TA450) launched Operation Olalampo, a spear-phishing campaign delivering multiple novel malware strains — including the Rust-based Char backdoor using Telegram for C2, the GhostFetch/GhostBackDoor loader chain, and the HTTP\_VIP downloader — against organizations across the Middle East and Africa. Group-IB identified signs of AI-assisted development in Char's command handlers, including debug strings containing emojis that were likely left unsanitized in LLM-generated code segments. Defenders should leverage the published IoCs, YARA rules, and EDR rules to detect activity, while monitoring for unauthorized AnyDesk deployments and Telegram-based C2 traffic.

[### The DJI Romo robovac had security so poor, this man remotely accessed thousands of them (4 minute read)](https://www.theverge.com/tech/879088/dji-romo-hack-vulnerability-remote-control-camera-access-mqtt?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A security researcher found that DJI's Romo robot vacuum lacked MQTT authentication, allowing any client to connect to DJI's servers and pull telemetry from roughly 7,000 devices across 24 countries. Live camera feeds, microphone access, 2D floor plans, and serial numbers were all available. In under 9 minutes, the researcher cataloged over 6,700 devices and collected more than 100,000 MQTT messages, revealing precise home layouts and approximate device locations via IP geolocation. DJI has reportedly closed the immediate access gap. Still, the deeper problem remains: the device-to-cloud channel trusts any authenticated session as a legitimate owner, a fundamental IoT authorization failure.

[### Conduent data breach grows, affecting at least 25M people (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/conduent-data-breach-grows-affecting-at-least-25m-people/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A ransomware attack on outsourcing giant Conduent has exposed personal data on at least 25 million people across multiple states in the US, including Oregon and Texas. Stolen information includes names, Social Security numbers, health insurance, and medical data.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Turn Dependabot Off (8 minute read)](https://words.filippo.io/dependabot?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Dependabot floods teams with noisy pull requests and misleading security alerts, and in Go projects, it rarely improves actual security. Filippo Valsorda breaks down why: the alerts often have no bearing on real risk, offer no package- or symbol-level filtering, and generate enough alert fatigue that teams start ignoring everything, including the alerts that matter. His recommended setup uses two scheduled GitHub Actions instead. The first runs govulncheck for reachability-based vulnerability scanning. The second runs tests daily against the latest dependency versions to catch breakage early without forcing constant upgrades. Together, they cut through the noise, slash false positives, and let teams take genuine security findings seriously.

[### A Bug is a Bug, but a Patch is a Policy: The Case for Bootable Containers (3 minute read)](https://tuananh.net/2026/02/20/patch-is-policy/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The Linux kernel CNA now assigns CVEs to nearly every bug fix, often without CVSS scores, and that decision has shattered the classic “patch anything above 7.0 within 30 days” compliance model. Security teams must now pick between expensive manual triage and just patching everything fast. Bootable containers (bootc) offer a middle path: they package the entire OS (kernel, drivers, and user-space) as an immutable container image with atomic updates and automatic rollback when health checks fail, which kills the reboot anxiety that causes update fatigue. The real shift is moving vulnerability management away from spreadsheet-driven CVSS triage toward build-file-scoped scanning of minimal images, turning patching into a routine CI/CD pipeline step rather than a high-stakes manual event.

[### Detecting and preventing distillation attacks (5 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/detecting-and-preventing-distillation-attacks?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Anthropic identified industrial-scale distillation campaigns by DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax that generated over 16 million exchanges across roughly 24,000 fraudulent accounts to extract Claude's agentic reasoning, tool use, and coding capabilities for training their own models. The labs used proxy services operating “hydra cluster” architectures with thousands of coordinated accounts to circumvent regional access restrictions, with MiniMax pivoting within 24 hours to target new model releases and DeepSeek specifically extracting chain-of-thought data and censorship-safe alternatives to politically sensitive queries. Anthropic has deployed behavioral fingerprinting classifiers, strengthened account verification, and is sharing technical indicators with other labs and authorities, warning that illicitly distilled models strip safety guardrails and undermine export controls.

### Launches & Tools

[### Your Biggest Risk Isn't a Vulnerability. It's a Path (Sponsor)](https://specterops.io/apm-maturity-model-assessment-tool/?utm_campaign=PAID_Adverti[%E2%80%A6]=Advertisement&amp;utm_source=TLDR&amp;Latest_Campaign=701Uw00000ePhXU)

A single misconfiguration rarely causes a breach. It's the chain — the quiet connections between identities, roles, and systems — that creates opportunity. Attack Path Management shows you those chains in full context. Take SpecterOps' [quick assessment](https://specterops.io/apm-maturity-model-assessment-tool/?utm_campaign=PAID_Adverti[%E2%80%A6]=Advertisement&utm_source=TLDR&Latest_Campaign=701Uw00000ePhXU) to see where your program falls on the maturity spectrum and access the[Maturity Model Report](https://specterops.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/Identity-APM-Maturity-Model_1034-0.pdf?utm_campaign=ContentSyndication_Paid_2025_11_24_TL%3BDR&utm_medium=Paid&utm_source=ContentSyndication&Latest_Campaign=701Uw00000b9aF4) for clear guidance to reduce attack paths.

### Miscellaneous

[### Why the KeePass format should be based on SQLite (8 minute read)](https://mketab.org/blog/sqlite_kdbx/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

KDBX's XML-based format has built up serious technical debt through a fragmented “shadow schema,” in which TOTP, passkeys, and autofill data have been shoehorned into custom attributes across incompatible client implementations. Migrating to SQLite with SQLCipher would fix this: page-level writes, lower memory overhead for large vaults, and a clean schema that treats modern credential types as first-class citizens rather than afterthoughts. The post also calls for a governance overhaul, pushing KeePassXC and major mobile clients to jointly define a new spec rather than continuing under a benevolent dictator model.

[### Cloudflare One is the first SASE offering modern post-quantum encryption across the full platform (12 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-sase/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Cloudflare One is the first SASE platform to support standards-compliant post-quantum hybrid ML-KEM encryption across all major on-ramps and off-ramps, including its Secure Web Gateway, Zero Trust, and WAN use cases. The upgrade extends post-quantum protection to Cloudflare IPsec (now in closed beta) and the Cloudflare One Appliance (GA in version 2026.2.0), defending enterprise traffic against harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks ahead of NIST's 2030 deadline for deprecating RSA and ECC. The implementation follows the draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-mlkem specification rather than proprietary approaches, and is available at no extra cost.

[### Korean cops charge teens over bike hire breach that exposed data on 4.62M riders (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/24/korean_bike_breach_charges/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

South Korean police charged two teens for breaching Seoul's Ttareungyi bike rental system in 2024, accessing data on 4.62 million of 5 million users, including contact and personal details. Investigators say the pair met on Telegram, hacked while still in middle school, and intended to profit, though there's no evidence the data was sold.
