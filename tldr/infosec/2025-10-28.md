AI code editors now generate weeks of code in hours. Traditional security crawls behind, creating backlogs that will never close.

But not all is lost...

Join CISOs and AI leaders from Nvidia, Salesforce, Glean, Augment, and others at [VibeSecCon](https://www.ox.security/events/vibeseccon/?utm_campaign=9574189-TLDR&utm_source=TLTR&utm_medium=email&utm_term=primary). This virtual summit will explore the death of "Shift Left," the 10 critical anti-patterns in AI-generated code, and the future of AI and security.

You'll also get a chance to experience [VibeSec by OX](https://www.ox.security/events/vibeseccon/?utm_campaign=9574189-TLDR&utm_source=TLTR&utm_medium=email&utm_term=primary) - a new approach to prevent insecure code from ever being created by embedding real-time, organization-specific context directly into AI coding agents, at the moment of code creation.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### QNAP Warns of Critical ASP.NET Flaw in its Windows Backup Software (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qnap-warns-its-windows-backup-software-is-also-affected-by-critical-aspnet-flaw/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

QNAP issued a warning to customers to patch a critical ASP.NET Core vulnerability that affects the company's NetBak PC Agent software for backing up data to a QNAP NAS (Network Attached Storage). This vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify server files, or perform a denial-of-service on the device. QNAP recommends that users either reinstall the NetBak PC Agent or manually update the ASP.NET Core install on their PCs.

[### DomeWatch Leak Exposed Personal Data of Capitol Hill Applicants (2 minute read)](https://hackread.com/domewatch-leak-capitol-hill-applicants-data/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A security researcher reported an unencrypted and non-password-protected database containing PII of over 7,000 applicants to the research firm Safety Detectives. The data includes names, phone numbers, email addresses, and security clearance status or level. 469 records listed individuals with “top secret” federal security clearance, which could expose those individuals to phishing risks.

[### How we built an exploit for SessionReaper, CVE-2025-54236 in Magento 2 & Adobe Commerce (20 minute read)](https://pentest-tools.com/blog/sessionreaper-cve-2025-54236-exploit?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Pentest-Tools researchers developed a working exploit for CVE-2025-54236 "SessionReaper," an unauthenticated vulnerability in Magento 2's ServiceInputProcessor that allows customer account takeover through session manipulation. The exploit leverages a Magento\Customer\Model\Session\Proxy object's setCustomerId function to inject arbitrary customer IDs into PHP sessions, enabling attackers to impersonate any customer by crafting malicious session cookies. Organizations should patch immediately and monitor for unauthorized attempts to manipulate sessions targeting Magento installations.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### The Linux Boot Process: From Power Button to Kernel (5 minute read)](https://www.0xkato.xyz/linux-boot/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

This deep dive explains the Linux boot sequence from CPU reset through various modes, including firmware handoffs, bootloader operations, kernel decompression, and memory setup with paging. It covers mode transitions, interrupt handling, GDT and IDT configuration, and kASLR, which randomizes kernel memory locations to prevent exploits. kASLR enhances security by randomizing kernel addresses, but can be disabled with nokaslr for debugging.

[### Scammers try to trick LastPass users into giving up credentials by telling them they're dead (6 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4079001/scammers-try-to-trick-lastpass-users-into-giving-up-credentials-by-telling-them-theyre-dead-2.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

CryptoChameleon cybercriminal group targets LastPass users with phishing emails claiming "Legacy Request Opened (URGENT IF YOU ARE NOT DECEASED)" that trick victims into entering master passwords on fake sites by exploiting legacy access scenarios when family members request deceased users' accounts. The campaign uses domain spoofing, fabricated support case details, and phone calls to direct victims to attacker-controlled URLs designed to harvest credentials for cryptocurrency theft. Organizations should implement phishing-resistant MFA for password managers, educate employees about this specific "Legacy Request" subject line, and establish policies requiring additional authentication factors beyond master passwords for account access.

[### Vibecoding and the illusion of security (9 minute read)](https://baldur.dk/blog/vibecoding-and-the-illusion-of-security.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

AI-powered coding, often called "vibecoding," claims to enable fast and seemingly secure development of features like two-factor authentication (2FA). However, this method often only creates the illusion of security, missing essential protections such as rate limiting and strong account lockout mechanisms. Attackers can easily bypass superficial safeguards, especially if limits depend on factors like IP addresses. Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate code that appears convincing, but without clear guidance, critical security measures are frequently overlooked or implemented incorrectly.

[### Does your IAM system break every time someone changes roles? (Sponsor)](https://rippling.registration.goldcast.io/webinar/238377a3-ffe5-48c3-89f3-bf189d41a798?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=10%2F29+IAM+deminar&amp;utm_content=webinar)

Traditional IAM tools depend on static data and fall apart if an employee switches departments or devices. [Rippling's new IAM](https://rippling.registration.goldcast.io/webinar/238377a3-ffe5-48c3-89f3-bf189d41a798?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=10%2F29+IAM+deminar&utm_content=webinar) grounds identity in real-time employee data instead - enabling automatic updates without manual provisioning or custom scripts. See how it works in [tomorrow's webinar](https://rippling.registration.goldcast.io/webinar/238377a3-ffe5-48c3-89f3-bf189d41a798?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=10%2F29+IAM+deminar&utm_content=webinar).

PDF Object Hash is a method for identifying similarities between PDFs based on their structure rather than content, akin to imphash or ja3 hashes. It involves extracting object types and hashing them to cluster similar documents and detect overlaps. Recent updates to the parsing scripts improve accuracy, especially for irregular or corrupted PDFs.

[### Full Student Database of MOIS-Affiliated Ravin Academy Leaked (5 minute read)](https://blog.narimangharib.com/posts/2025%2F10%2F1761116665973?lang=en&amp;utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A comprehensive student database from Ravin Academy, a US Treasury-designated MOIS front organization used to recruit cyber operatives, has been leaked just days before its annual Tech Olympics event in Tehran. The exposed records contain complete personal information of trainees enrolled in what appears to be legitimate cybersecurity education, but serves as a talent pipeline for Iranian state-sponsored cyber operations against foreign governments and domestic dissidents. Organizations should monitor for individuals with Ravin Academy connections and note that the operational security failure demonstrates vulnerabilities in Iranian intelligence recruitment infrastructure.

[### Mem3nt0 mori – The Hacking Team is back! (15 minute read)](https://securelist.com/forumtroll-apt-hacking-team-dante-spyware/117851/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Kaspersky uncovered Operation ForumTroll, a sophisticated espionage campaign using personalized phishing emails that exploit CVE-2025-2783, a Chrome sandbox escape vulnerability affecting Windows Inter-Process Communication (IPC) pseudo handles. The operation deployed "Dante" spyware by Memento Labs, targeting Russian entities through zero-day exploits and evasion techniques such as WebGPU validation and COM hijacking. Security teams should monitor for Base64 folders in %LocalAppData%, enhance email filtering for personalized phishing, and update Chrome to version 134.0.6998.177/178 or later to mitigate the sandbox vulnerability.
