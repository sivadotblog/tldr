### Strategies & Tactics

[### “Scamlexity” We Put Agentic AI Browsers to the Test - They Clicked, They Paid, They Failed (9 minute read)](https://guard.io/labs/scamlexity-we-put-agentic-ai-browsers-to-the-test-they-clicked-they-paid-they-failed?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

As AI browsers like Comet take over online tasks, they're dangerously vulnerable to scams and prompt injections, sometimes making purchases or clicking harmful links without user awareness. Traditional fraud techniques and new AI-targeted tricks can easily fool agentic AI, making users pay the price. Security must be built into AI browsers from the ground up, not treated as an afterthought, to protect users in this new era of automated scamming.

[### Russia-linked European attacks renew concerns over water cybersecurity (5 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4042449/russia-linked-european-attacks-renew-concerns-over-water-cybersecurity.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Russian hackers probably sabotaged a Norwegian dam in April by remotely opening valves for four hours. Poland also reported a thwarted cyberattack that could have cut water to a major city. These attacks, linked to groups like Z-Pentest Alliance, show water facilities as vulnerable targets that could lead to bigger threats. Water utilities should boost cybersecurity with more funding, consulting, or free resources like the DEF CON Franklin project.

[### SpyVPN: The Google-Featured VPN That Secretly Captures Your Screen (7 minute read)](https://www.koi.security/blog/spyvpn-the-vpn-that-secretly-captures-your-screen?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

FreeVPN.One, a popular VPN Chrome extension, secretly takes screenshots of users' browsing—including sensitive info—and uploads them to the developer's servers without consent. Despite claiming to protect privacy, it abuses permissions, uses encryption to evade detection, and provides misleading explanations, exposing security flaws in Chrome extensions.

[### Copilot Broke Your Audit Log, but Microsoft Won't Tell You (8 minute read)](https://pistachioapp.com/blog/copilot-broke-your-audit-log?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Microsoft's Copilot AI allowed users to access files in M365 without leaving audit log records, creating potential security and compliance risks. This was reported to Microsoft, which quietly fixed the issue but chose not to notify customers or issue a formal security alert. Any organization using Copilot before August 18 may have incomplete audit logs and might be unaware of what happened.

[### You Don't Need a Vendor to Automate Security Questionnaires (7 minute read)](https://blog.marcolancini.it/2025/blog-automate-security-questionnaires-with-ai/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Security questionnaires are a standard part of the security review process that can often be tedious, time-consuming, and mechanical for vendors' teams. Instead of buying a tool to handle this process, vendors can either build their own RAG or use Claude/ChatGPT. To use Claude/ChatGPT, prepare a folder with the relevant documents that would be included in a Trust Center, as well as some previously manually completed questionnaires.
