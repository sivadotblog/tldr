### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### eScan confirms update server breached to push malicious update (3 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/escan-confirms-update-server-breached-to-push-malicious-update/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

MicroWorld Technologies confirmed unauthorized access to a regional eScan antivirus update server resulted in malicious updates distributed to customers during a two-hour window on January 20, deploying a modified "Reload.exe" file signed with what appears to be eScan's certificate. An analysis revealed the malware enabled persistence through scheduled tasks named "CorelDefrag", modified Windows HOSTS files to prevent legitimate updates, and connected to multiple C2 servers to download CONSCTLX.exe backdoor as the final payload. eScan isolated the compromised infrastructure within hours, rotated credentials, and released a remediation update for affected customers, though the company disputed claims about the discovery timeline and customer notification efforts.

[### Thousands more Oregon residents learn their health data was stolen in TriZetto breach (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/trizetto_health_data_stolen/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A 2024 cyberattack on TriZetto Provider Solutions exposed protected health information and personal data for more than 700,000 patients across multiple US states, and the breach was not detected until nearly a year later. Oregon clinics are now notifying thousands of affected patients, while the owner, Cognizant, faces multiple class action lawsuits despite claiming the threat was swiftly contained and that no ransom was involved.

[### Fake Clawdbot VS Code Extension Installs ScreenConnect RAT (18 minute read)](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/fake-clawdbot-vscode-extension-malware?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Aikido Security discovered a trojanized "ClawdBot Agent" VS Code extension impersonating the viral AI assistant Clawdbot, which deploys weaponized ConnectWise ScreenConnect software (Code.exe) configured to connect to attacker infrastructure. Microsoft quickly removed the extension after disclosure. The malware features a sophisticated multi-layered payload delivery. The attack demonstrates advanced evasion through functional AI features to avoid suspicion, process camouflage using legitimate VS Code executable names, DLL sideloading with anti-analysis timing checks, and quadruple impersonation layers that successfully weaponize trusted remote administration software.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Understanding the Russian Cyber Threat to the 2026 Winter Olympics (6 minute read)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/russian-cyberthreat-2026-winter-olympics/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Russia's exclusion from the 2026 Winter Olympics removes critical geopolitical deterrents. The threat model has shifted from espionage to disruption, with potential attacks including destructive malware targeting operational technology, exploitation of Smart Road SS51 Alemagna's V2X infrastructure to hijack Variable Message Signs, and AI-amplified hybrid attacks combining cyber disruptions with high-fidelity deepfakes to transform technical outages into public safety crises. Defenders should prioritize zero-trust visibility with anomaly detection for IoT devices, implement micro-segmentation to prevent lateral movement from compromised edge devices, and deploy content provenance measures to verify legitimate communications against AI-generated content.

[### AI found 12 of 12 OpenSSL zero-days (while curl cancelled its bug bounty) (15 minute read)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7aJwgbMEiKq5egQbd/ai-found-12-of-12-openssl-zero-days-while-curl-cancelled-its?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

AISLE's AI system discovered all 12 zero-day vulnerabilities in OpenSSL's January 2026 security release, marking the first real-world demonstration of AI-based vulnerability discovery at industrial scale. The findings span multiple subsystems and include vulnerabilities that remained undetected for up to 27 years, bringing AISLE's total to 13 of 14 CVE-2025-\* vulnerabilities discovered in OpenSSL plus 5 genuine CVEs in curl. This achievement contrasts sharply with curl's cancellation of its bug bounty program due to overwhelming AI-generated spam, illustrating how AI simultaneously collapses median submission quality while raising the ceiling for sophisticated vulnerability discovery in critical infrastructure.

[### A Brief Deep Dive into Attacking and Defending Kubernetes (10 minute read)](https://heilancoos.github.io/research/2025/12/16/kubernetes.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Kubernetes vulnerabilities can be divided into four key categories: pod weaknesses, identity and access mechanisms, cluster configuration components, and control plane entry points. This post provides a deep dive into several specific attack areas, including overly permissive RBAC, service account token abuse, malicious admissions controllers, writable volume mounts, unauthorized access to ETCD, and Kubernetes golden tickets. Each section includes an explanation of the attack vector, possible defenses, and a Falco rule to detect the attack.

[### U.S. convicts ex-Google engineer for sending AI tech data to China (3 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-convicts-ex-google-engineer-for-sending-ai-tech-data-to-china/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Former Google software engineer Linwei Ding was convicted on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of trade secret theft for stealing over 2,000 pages of confidential AI materials between May 2022 and April 2023, including Google's AI supercomputing infrastructure, proprietary TPU/GPU systems, orchestration software, and SmartNIC networking technology. Ding is secretly affiliated with two China-based technology companies. He had a colleague scan his badge to falsely indicate his presence while traveling to China. The case highlights insider threat risks, as Ding stated his goal was to help China achieve computing infrastructure capabilities on par with international levels. Each conviction carries a maximum sentence of 10-15 years.

[### Undressed victims file class action lawsuit against xAI for Grok deepfakes (4 minute read)](https://cyberscoop.com/grok-undressed-victims-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-xai-elon-musk/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

At least 100 victims filed a class action lawsuit against xAI, alleging that Grok generated 4.4 million images over nine days, including at least 1.8 million non-consensual sexualized deepfakes of women, men, and children, posted publicly on X. The lawsuit claims that xAI executives knowingly failed to implement industry-standard safeguards and instead encouraged users to create "nudified" content through features such as tagging handles to manipulate photos and a "spicy" option for generating controversial content. The case adds to mounting legal pressure on xAI and Musk: 35 State Attorneys General have expressed "deep concern," and formal investigations have been opened by the EU, UK, South Korea, Canada, and Brazil, while US federal agencies remain silent.

[### OpenClaw AI Runs Wild in Business Environments (5 minute read)](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/openclaw-ai-runs-wild-business-environments?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

OpenClaw, a widely popular open-source AI agent, is rapidly gaining adoption across enterprises, integrating with email, messaging, and system tools, creating powerful non-human identities with broad access. Experts warn that its “vibe-coded” development, supply chain exposure, and susceptibility to prompt injection form a “lethal trifecta” of risk.
