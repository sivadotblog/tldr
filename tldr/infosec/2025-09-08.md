A new phishing campaign that leverages iCloud Calendar invites was reported to BleepingComputer. The phishing email notifies the user that their PayPal account is being charged and requests the user to call a given phone number.

[### What Framing Security Alerts as a Binary True or False Positive is Costing You (6 minute read)](https://www.magonia.io/what-framing-security-alerts-as-a-binary-true-or-false-positive-is-costing-you/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The true/false positive binaries only capture whether an alert accurately alerts on a signal, but not if it is impactful. The author proposes adding a layer of intent or disposition to alert metrics to measure whether the alert had an actual business impact. This leads to a refined classification with the steps: True Positive - Malicious, True Positive - Suspicious, True Positive - No Business Impact, and False Positive.
