### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Pixel-stealing “Pixnapping” attack targets Android devices (3 minute read)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/10/pixel-stealing-pixnapping-attack-targets-android-devices?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

“Pixnapping” is an advanced attack where a malicious Android app can secretly steal individual pixels from your device's screen—enabling it to extract sensitive data like 2FA codes, even from supposedly secure apps. The attack exploits Android's app messaging system and nearly invisible overlays.

[### Satellites found exposing unencrypted data, including phone calls and some military comms (1 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/satellites-found-exposing-unencrypted-data-including-phone-calls-and-some-military-comms/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Sensitive personal, corporate, and military data is being transmitted unencrypted via about half of Earth's geostationary satellites, according to researchers. Using a basic satellite receiver, they accessed voice calls, texts, and critical infrastructure communications, exposing serious privacy and security risks.

In early 2025, a cyberattack at SimonMed Imaging exposed the data of over 1.27 million patients, including medical and personal information, with the ransomware group Medusa claiming responsibility. Medusa likely received a ransom to prevent data release. SimonMed responded with improved security measures and offered credit monitoring and identity theft protection to impacted people.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### How Do Timing Attacks Work? (3 minute read)](https://nickg.ca/#/posts/timing-attacks?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Timing attacks that target string comparison work by measuring how long it takes a vulnerable server to verify a string, such as a password or other secret. When a vulnerable function compares two strings, it loops through each character to check for equality, causing the function to take slightly longer to complete with each correct character. The page includes a demo for how this attack works in practice.

Signal Messenger has rolled out a major upgrade to its encryption protocol, making it resistant to future quantum computer attacks. This technical overhaul adds a third layer—a quantum-safe ratchet—to its already-robust system to ensure strong privacy even if classical encryption breaks. Thanks to clever use of chunking methods and erasure codes, Signal's triple ratchet protects users' messaging by combining classic and quantum-safe security mechanisms, all without impacting everyday use.

[### Why Unmonitored JavaScript Is Your Biggest Holiday Security Risk (5 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/why-unmonitored-javascript-is-your.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Client-side JavaScript attacks pose a critical blind spot for e-commerce security as 73% of sites load 50+ third-party scripts on checkout pages while only 23% use dedicated client-side monitoring, allowing attackers to steal payment data through browser-based skimmers that bypass WAFs and traditional server-side defenses entirely. Major 2024 attacks, including the Polyfill.io breach affecting over 500,000 websites and Cisco's Magecart incident, demonstrate how compromised third-party scripts and supply chain vulnerabilities enable data theft that often goes undetected for an average of 7.5 months, with incidents costing $2.4 million plus regulatory fines. Security teams should immediately implement Content Security Policy with nonces (avoiding ‘unsafe-inline'), deploy Subresource Integrity tags for third-party scripts, establish comprehensive script inventories with regular audits, and deploy specialized client-side monitoring tools to detect unauthorized data collection, DOM manipulation, and suspicious script behavior before the 2025 holiday shopping season.

[### Comparing Semgrep vs. AppSec Alternatives (Sponsor)](https://semgrep.dev/resources/semgrep-vs-snyk?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=paidsocial)

Independent reviewers confirm that using Semgrep can [cut false positives by over 90%](https://semgrep.dev/resources/semgrep-vs-snyk?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paidsocial) compared to popular alternatives:

* With Semgrep, there's no need to manually filter and prioritize findings because developers only see exploitable, high-priority issues.
* Instead of asking devs to trust a black box, Semgrep offers explainable findings with rule-level visibility.
* Semgrep then delivers AI-assisted, step-by-step fix guidance to reduce issue resolution time.

👉 The bottom line? Developers spend [86% less time reviewing findings](https://semgrep.dev/resources/semgrep-vs-snyk?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=paidsocial) and sifting through alert noise. That's 15+ hours saved every week.
