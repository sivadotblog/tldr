The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly emerging as the go-to standard for connecting LLMs to external tools and data. But as adoption picks up, many teams are implementing MCP without a clear security playbook.

[This practical guide](https://www.wiz.io/lp/inside-mcp-security-a-research-guide-on-emerging-risks?utm_source=tldr-infosec&utm_medium=paid-email&utm_campaign=FY26Q2_INB_FORM_MCP-Security-Research-Guide-Emerging-Risks&sfcid=701Py00000PcNI9IAN&utm_term=FY26Q3-tldr-infosec-nl&utm_content=MCP-Security-Guide) breaks down real-world MCP security risks and offers actionable steps to help teams secure LLM integrations.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Researchers Detail Windows EPM Poisoning Exploit Chain Leading to Domain Privilege Escalation (1 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/researchers-detail-windows-epm.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Security researchers found an exploit chain in Windows Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) that lets attackers escalate privileges to domain admin. The attack poisons EPM policies to bypass security controls and elevate privileges. Organizations using Windows EPM should review their settings and update security measures.

[### Bouygues Telecom Hit by Cyberattack, 6.4 Million Customers Affected (2 minute read)](https://hackread.com/bouygues-telecom-cyberattack-6-4m-customers-affected/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Bouygues Telecom, a French provider, suffered a cyberattack that exposed the data of 6.4 million customers, including names, emails, and phone numbers, but not payment info. It notified affected customers and authorities during its investigation.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### The security principles guiding 1Password's approach to AI (5 minute read)](https://blog.1password.com/security-principles-guiding-1passwords-approach-to-ai/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Seven core security principles for AI integration: encrypting secrets, using deterministic authorization over probabilistic LLM decisions, preventing raw credentials in LLM contexts, maintaining auditability, ensuring transparency, implementing least privilege, and balancing security with usability. AI agents must follow strict access controls, similar to humans, with credentials delivered securely (e.g., OAuth) rather than through LLM prompts, maintaining a zero-knowledge architecture. These principles show that traditional siloed privileged access management is inadequate for the AI era, which will require unified frameworks for both human and AI interactions.

[### Three Dots to Root: How I Found a Path Traversal in Microsoft's Agentic Web (6 minute read)](https://medium.com/@guanaonan/three-dots-to-root-how-i-found-a-path-traversal-in-microsofts-agentic-web-nlweb-4e8d8f483327?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Microsoft's NLWeb is a new framework designed to allow AI agents to interact with websites and APIs via natural language. This author describes how they discovered a path traversal vulnerability that could lead to the disclosure of arbitrary files such as `/etc/passwd` or `.env`. The vulnerability was caused by the use of the `os.path.normpath()` function, which does not prevent “climbing out” of the directory using `../`.

[### Constructing a Trustworthy Evaluation Methodology for Contextual Security Analysis (7 minute read)](https://www.dryrun.security/blog/constructing-a-trustworthy-evaluation-methodology-for-contextual-security-analysis?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

DryRun Security uses an AI engine called Contextual Security Analysis (CSA) to analyze code changes probabilistically. Each PR goes through three steps: whole-PR synthesis to understand the goal, hunk-scoped reasoning to isolate individual code hunks and filter out unrelated changes, and on-demand context acquisition to retrieve supporting files and dependencies. DryRun also has a secondary audit model that randomly samples production findings every 24 hours to check instruction compliance, hallucination detection, and vulnerability accuracy.

[### AppSec/ProdSec's Reality Gap (12 minute read)](https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/appsecprodsecs-reality-gap-why-theory?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Application and Product Security face a disparity in connecting theoretical security concepts to practical environments. A lack of context defines the problem space, teams trying to avoid slowing down development, security tools not addressing where teams are struggling or organizational scale, and tooling being designed for gates instead of guardrails. AI-based tools may help in providing more context and tailored experiences, but they will not alleviate the resource constraints that many teams face.
