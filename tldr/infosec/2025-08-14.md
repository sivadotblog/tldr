[### Detection Engineering: Practicing Detection-As-Code (6 minute read)](https://blog.nviso.eu/2025/07/08/detection-engineering-practicing-detection-as-code-introduction-part-1/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

This is part one of an ongoing series on implementing detection-as-code (DaC). It introduces core concepts such as the detection development life cycle (DDLC) and components of DaC, such as version control, code review, testing, and CI/CD pipelines. Organizations that embrace DaC can collaborate more easily, have more consistent, efficient, and higher quality detections, have better documentation, and can scale more effectively.

[### What the LockBit 4.0 Leak Reveals About RaaS Groups (5 minute read)](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/what-lockbit-leak-reveals-raas-groups?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

LockBit 4.0's leaked affiliate panel exposes a fragmented, chaotic RaaS operation: inconsistent negotiations, broken decryptors, unpaid platform fees, and even hits on prohibited Russian targets. This unpredictability complicates defense and incident response. The takeaway: don't rely on negotiation—prioritize preparation (segmentation, MFA, patching, and lateral-movement monitoring), as RaaS brands splinter and attribution grows harder.

The US indicated a shift from strictly defensive capabilities to increasing offensive capabilities with the allocation of $1B in funding for offensive operations that was included in the “Big Beautiful Bill.” This funding will allow the US to operationalize offensive tooling more rapidly and develop the infrastructure to support more complex operations. Defensive deterrents have not been effective enough in cyberwarfare. This shift to offensive deterrents is necessary to maintain US cyber supremacy.
