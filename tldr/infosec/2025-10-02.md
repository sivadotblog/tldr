### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Volvo Group Employee Data Stolen in Ransomware Attack (2 minute read)](https://www.securityweek.com/volvo-group-employee-data-stolen-in-ransomware-attack/amp/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Volvo has reported that a hack of a third-party IT company, Miljödata, impacted it. The attackers breached the company's Adato support system for rehabilitation and Novi support system for HHR personnel notes. The Volvo Group stated that the incident impacted its employees' names and SSNs.

[### Exploit Allows for Takeover of Fleets of Unitree Robots (3 minute read)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/unitree-robot-exploit?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Security researchers discovered a wormable vulnerability in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Wi-Fi configuration interface used by several Unitree robots, which could result in remote code execution. Unitree robots utilize an initial BLE connection to facilitate the setup of a Wi-Fi connection. However, the encryption keys for the packets that the robot accepts were published on X. The researchers discovered that if an attacker encrypts the word “unitree” with these keys, the robot will allow them to inject arbitrary code masquerading as the Wi-Fi SSID and password, which will then be executed when the robot tries to connect to Wi-Fi.

[### Broadcom fixes high-severity VMware NSX bugs reported by NSA (3 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/broadcom-fixes-high-severity-vmware-nsx-bugs-reported-by-nsa/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Broadcom has patched two high-severity VMware NSX vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-41251 and CVE-2025-41252) reported by the NSA, both involving username enumeration flaws in password recovery mechanisms that allow unauthenticated attackers to identify valid usernames for potential brute-force attacks. These vulnerabilities affect VMware NSX, a critical networking virtualization solution widely used in enterprise private and hybrid cloud environments, making them attractive targets for state-sponsored hackers and ransomware groups that frequently exploit VMware products. Security professionals should immediately apply the available patches and review their VMware infrastructure for other recent vulnerabilities, as this follows a pattern of actively exploited VMware zero-days throughout 2025, including those used by Chinese state actors and disclosed at security conferences.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Echoes of AI Exposure: Thousands of Secrets Leaking Through Vibe Coded Sites (7 minute read)](https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/echoes-of-ai-exposure-thousands-of-secrets-leaking-through-vibe-coded-sites-wave-15-project-resonance/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

1 in 5 websites built on "vibe coding" platforms (no-code/low-code tools) expose sensitive secrets, with 25,000 leaked API keys found across 130,000 scanned sites, including a surge in AI platform credentials (72% Google Gemini, 14% OpenAI) and 16,000+ Firebase backend keys. The root cause is non-technical users following tutorials that embed API keys directly into client-side code without understanding the security implications, creating opportunities for credential theft and unauthorized service usage. Security teams should implement continuous threat exposure management (CTEM) to monitor citizen developer activities, while platforms need pre-publish secret scanning and better secret management features to prevent these exposures.

[### Akira Ransomware Breaching MFA-Protected SonicWall VPN Accounts (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/akira-ransomware-breaching-mfa-protected-sonicwall-vpn-accounts/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

In July, BleepingComputer reported that the Akira ransomware operation was exploiting SonicWall SSL VPN devices to breach corporate networks. SonicWall eventually linked the attacks to an improper access control flaw that was patched and disclosed in late 2024. Security firm Arctic Wolf now reports an ongoing campaign against SonicWall firewalls, where threat actors are successfully logging into accounts even when one-time passwords (OTPs) are enabled. Google Threat Intelligence Group suggests that the attackers may have harvested the OTP seeds earlier and waited to use them.

[### Silent Smishing: The Hidden Abuse of Cellular Router APIs (20 minute read)](https://blog.sekoia.io/silent-smishing-the-hidden-abuse-of-cellular-router-apis/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Threat actors have been exploiting APIs on over 572 Milesight industrial cellular routers to send smishing campaigns targeting European users since February 2022, with a primary focus on Belgium. The messages impersonate government services, including CSAM (the central system for identity and access management for the government's online services) and eBox. The attackers leverage CVE-2023-43261 and exposed APIs to remotely send SMS messages without authentication, utilizing routers as a distributed infrastructure across multiple countries to evade detection and enable mass phishing campaigns, with over 40,000 messages sent to Swedish and Italian numbers in a single campaign. Security professionals should audit cellular router configurations for exposed SMS APIs, implement authentication requirements, update firmware to versions beyond the vulnerable 32.x and 41.x versions, and monitor for unusual POST requests to /cgi endpoints. Additionally, they should educate users to scrutinize unsolicited SMS messages that contain shortened URLs or use urgent language.

[### CISA 2015 cyber threat info-sharing law lapses amid government shutdown (4 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4065998/cisa-2015-cyber-threat-info-sharing-law-lapses-amid-government-shutdown.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 expired on September 30 due to a government shutdown, removing critical liability protections that enabled private sector cybersecurity threat information sharing with the government and peers. Without these legal safeguards, organizations now face potential antitrust violations, FOIA disclosure risks, and loss of trade secret protections when sharing threat intelligence, significantly reducing real-time threat visibility across critical infrastructure sectors. Security professionals should immediately consult with legal counsel before engaging in any threat-sharing activities and may need to revert to pre-2015 bilateral agreements, where available, as the timing for congressional reauthorization remains uncertain.

[### Red Hat OpenShift AI Flaw Exposes Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure to Full Takeover (2 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/critical-red-hat-openshift-ai-flaw.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-10725) has been identified in Red Hat OpenShift AI that allows authenticated attackers to escalate privileges and potentially compromise entire cloud environments. Versions 2.19, 2.21, and RHOAI are affected. Red Hat recommends limiting permissions, especially for system groups, and suggests granting job creation rights only to specific users or groups to minimize risk.

[### Phantom Taurus: A New Chinese Nexus APT and the Discovery of the NET-STAR Malware Suite (16 minute read)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/phantom-taurus/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Phantom Taurus is a Chinese state-sponsored APT group targeting government and telecom organizations across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia for espionage aligned with PRC interests. Evolving from email attacks to database targeting, it utilizes custom tools like the NET-STAR malware suite, which includes three fileless .NET backdoors (IIServerCore, AssemblyExecuter V1/V2), to compromise IIS web servers. It employs evasion tactics such as AMSI and ETW bypasses. Security teams should watch for TTPs such as timestomping, fileless execution within w3wp.exe, and ASPX web shells, including OutlookEN.aspx, while managing threat exposure to detect infrastructure sharing among Chinese APT groups.
