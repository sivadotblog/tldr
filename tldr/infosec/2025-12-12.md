### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Pierce County Library Data Breach Impacts 340,000 (2 minute read)](https://www.securityweek.com/pierce-county-library-data-breach-impacts-340000/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Hackers accessed the Pierce County Library System's network in April and stole data from more than 340,000 patrons, employees, and their family members. Patron data includes names and dates of birth, while employee-related data also covers Social Security numbers, IDs, financial and health information.

[### Security flaws in Freedom Chat app exposed users' phone numbers and PINs (3 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/security-flaws-in-freedom-chat-app-exposed-users-phone-numbers-and-pins/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Two major flaws in Freedom Chat have been discovered: one allowed attackers to enumerate nearly 2,000 users' phone numbers by mass-guessing them against the app's servers, and another leaked users' PIN codes to everyone in the default public channel via backend responses. Freedom Chat reset all PINs, tightened rate limiting, removed exposed numbers, and shipped an updated version. This is founder Tanner Haas' second messaging app to face serious security issues.

[### New OpenAI Models Likely Pose “High” Cybersecurity Risk (2 minute read)](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/10/openai-new-models-cybersecurity-risks?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

OpenAI has stated that the cybersecurity capabilities of its frontier models are accelerating rapidly and that upcoming models are likely to pose a “high” risk. OpenAI notes that in August, GPT-5 scored 27% on a CTF, whereas last month GPT-5.1-Codex-Max scored 76%. OpenAI's Fouad Martin points to the models' ability to work for extended periods as a driving force behind this.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Weaponizing the AWS CLI for Persistence (5 minute read)](https://slayer0x.github.io/awscli/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The AWS CLI allows users to define command aliases that can run arbitrary bash commands. A limitation that previous work faced when trying to abuse aliases was that if an attacker overwrote a command (such as `aws sts`) with a malicious alias, they could not call the original command. This post introduces a one-liner that dynamically modifies the alias file to restore the original command so it can be used in the malicious alias and then restores the malicious alias after running.

[### Securing MCP Servers With 1Password (3 minute read)](https://1password.com/blog/securing-mcp-servers-with-1password-stop-credential-exposure-in-your-agent?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configurations used by AI development tools like Cursor and Claude Code typically store plaintext API keys in mcp.json files, creating a risk of credential exposure when repositories are pushed to version control or shared with teammates. Developers can eliminate this risk by storing secrets in 1Password vaults, referencing them using op://vault/item/field syntax in .env files, and launching MCP servers with the 1Password CLI command op run --env-file=.env to dynamically inject credentials at runtime without persisting them on disk. This pattern ensures secrets are decrypted only in memory during process execution and automatically disappear when the process exits, preventing accidental exposure in Git history while maintaining developer productivity.

[### Infostealer has entered the chat (7 minute read)](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/share-chatgpt-chat-clickfix-macos-amos-infostealer/54928/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Criminals are exploiting interest in OpenAI's Atlas browser by buying Google ads that point to a shared ChatGPT conversation posing as an installation guide for a macOS “Atlas browser.” The guide instructs users to run a one‑line Terminal command that silently downloads a script, steals credentials, and deploys the AMOS infostealer, which exfiltrates browser data, crypto‑wallet info, documents, and more, while also installing a backdoor for persistent remote access.

[### 10K Docker images spray live cloud creds across the internet (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/11/docker_hub_secrets_leak/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Flare's research reveals that over 10,000 public Docker Hub images expose active secrets from more than 100 organizations, including a Fortune 500 company and a major bank, often via personal or “shadow IT” accounts. These images leak API keys and other live credentials for cloud, CI/CD, and AI services, and even when secrets are removed from images, about three-quarters of the underlying keys remain valid, leaving organizations open to compromise.

[### Copilot's No-Code AI Agents Liable to Leak Company Data (3 minute read)](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/copilot-no-code-ai-agents-leak-company-data?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Nontechnical employees can quickly build Copilot Studio agents that connect to sensitive systems, but these bots are easily tricked into ignoring security instructions, leaking customer data, and even modifying records such as trip costs. Tenable's experiment with a travel-booking bot shows how simple prompt injections expose credit card details and abuse edit permissions.

[### Stop Hacklore: An Open Letter (4 minute read)](https://www.hacklore.org/letter?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A group of current and former CISOs, security leaders, and practitioners has released an open letter urging the public, employers, journalists, and policymakers to stop spreading outdated security recommendations. Specifically, they cited: avoid public WiFi, never scan QR codes, never charge devices from public USB ports, turn off Bluetooth and NFC, regularly clear cookies, and regularly change passwords as outdated advice. Instead, they recommend focusing on reminding the public to keep critical devices and applications updated, enabling MFA, and using strong passphrases and password managers.
