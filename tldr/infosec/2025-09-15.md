[### Email threats are rising—basic defenses still lag (Sponsor)](https://exclaimer.com/research/state-of-email-report-2025/?utm_medium=via-campaign-referral&amp;utm_source=tldr_newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=tldr&amp;utm_content=state_of_email_report)

83% of IT leaders have faced email-related security incidents, and nearly half saw them happen in just the past year. Phishing and spoofing top the list—making email not just a communication tool, but a frontline risk surface. But despite the risk, only 33% have implemented core protections like DMARC, DKIM, or SPF.

The disconnect is clear: exposure is rising, but the fundamentals are still missing.

Exclaimer's latest research reveals how IT leaders are reassessing their defenses and building email into their broader risk posture—without adding more manual work.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### WhiteCobra Floods VSCode Market With Crypto-Stealing Extensions (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/whitecobra-floods-vscode-market-with-crypto-stealing-extensions/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A threat actor named WhiteCobra has been flooding the VSCode marketplace and OpenVSX registry with malicious extensions targeting VSCode, Cursor, and Windsurf users. The extensions contain an extension.js file that is nearly identical to the Hello World example but loads a prompt.js file, which downloads and executes a platform-specific infostealer payload from Cloudflare Pages. An Ethereum core developer reported on X that their wallet was drained after downloading a seemingly legitimate extension with a professional logo, detailed description, and 54K downloads.

[### Samsung Patches Actively Exploited Zero-Day Reported by WhatsApp Devs (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/samsung-patches-actively-exploited-zero-day-reported-by-whatsapp/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Samsung patched a remote code execution vulnerability that impacted Samsung devices running Android 13 or later. The vulnerability arose from an out-of-bounds write in the libimagecodec.quram.so library, which is used for image parsing. Apple patched the relevant vulnerability in its devices last month after it was reported to it by WhatsApp and Meta researchers as well.

[### HybridPetya ransomware bypasses UEFI Secure Boot echoing Petya/NotPetya (3 minute read)](https://securityaffairs.com/182149/malware/hybridpetya-ransomware-bypasses-uefi-secure-boot-echoing-petya-notpetya.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The HybridPetya ransomware on VirusTotal echoes the infamous Petya/NotPetya attacks but adds UEFI bootkit capabilities and exploits CVE-2024-7344 to bypass UEFI Secure Boot on outdated systems. Unlike NotPetya, HybridPetya functions as actual ransomware with decryption capabilities, encrypting the Master File Table after compromising EFI partitions and displaying fake CHKDSK status before showing ransom demands. This marks the fourth known UEFI bootkit with Secure Boot bypass capability, joining BlackLotus, BootKitty, and the Hyper-V Backdoor PoC, indicating these sophisticated attacks are becoming more common.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Supabase Security Best Practices (2025 Guide) (20 minute read)](https://www.pentestly.io/blog/supabase-security-best-practices-2025-guide?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

This comprehensive guide addresses frequent security pitfalls seen in Supabase deployments, offering precise and practical solutions grounded in recent audits. It covers how components like authentication, database schemas, Edge Functions, storage, and CORS interact from a security perspective and how to secure them with simple, effective policies—such as “read-only by default”, automate audits, and revisit configurations as the platform evolves.

[### The curious tale of a fake Carrier.app (17 minute read)](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/06/curious-case-carrier-app.html?m=1&amp;utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Google Project Zero found a fake carrier app exploiting a heap overflow in Apple's DCP firmware on iPhone 12/13. The exploit bypassed kernel protections by targeting the DCP's weaker security, using a fake Vodafone app distributed via enterprise certificates to sideload malware. The vulnerability (CVE-2021-30983) caused memory corruption through an unbounded loop in display code, allowing attackers to gain kernel access by corrupting C++ objects and manipulating memory between the DCP and main system.

[### Unmasking The Gentlemen Ransomware: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures Revealed (12 minute read)](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/i/unmasking-the-gentlemen-ransomware.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The Gentlemen ransomware group has executed sophisticated attacks across 17 countries, focusing on sectors like manufacturing and healthcare. Their operations use custom tools to bypass security measures, exploit privileged accounts, and deploy ransomware with double extortion tactics. The campaign demonstrates a shift to highly tailored, evasive strategies, raising the bar for enterprise defense and incident response recommendations.

### Launches & Tools

[### AI-powered email attacks just met their match - an AI detection engineer (Sponsor)](https://sublime.security/blog/meet-ade-the-autonomous-detection-engineer-for-email?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=content-synd&amp;utm_campaign=tldr_newsletter&amp;utm_content=ADE_launch)

Email attacks are evolving faster than security teams can write rules. Sublime's [ADÉ](https://sublime.security/blog/meet-ade-the-autonomous-detection-engineer-for-email?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=content-synd&utm_campaign=tldr_newsletter&utm_content=ADE_launch) (Autonomous Detection Engineer) fights fire with fire: while hackers automate phishing and social engineering attacks, ADÉ [automatically creates and backtests Detection Rules](https://sublime.security/blog/meet-ade-the-autonomous-detection-engineer-for-email?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=content-synd&utm_campaign=tldr_newsletter&utm_content=ADE_launch) in response to missed attacks.

Unlike black-box AI solutions, [ADÉ writes transparent, explainable rules that analysts can understand and verify](https://sublime.security/blog/meet-ade-the-autonomous-detection-engineer-for-email?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=content-synd&utm_campaign=tldr_newsletter&utm_content=ADE_launch). When attacks slip through, ADÉ analyzes signals, creates or updates rules, validates against historical data, and presents clear logic for human review. It closes detection gaps in hours - and it does so per-environment, rather than with one-size-fits-all rules.
