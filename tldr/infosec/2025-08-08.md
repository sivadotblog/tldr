[### Cato Named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for SASE Platforms. Again. (Sponsor)](https://www.catonetworks.com/resources/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-sase-platforms-2025/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=tldr-infosec&amp;utm_campaign=20250811)

Cloud growth. Hybrid work. Global expansion. IT complexity keeps rising.

When [Gartner defined SASE](https://www.catonetworks.com/resources/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-sase-platforms-2025/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-infosec&utm_campaign=20250811) (Secure Access Service Edge) to meet the needs of modern enterprises, many vendors scrambled to respond—forcing together networking and security point solutions or acquiring technologies to fit the framework.

That's not true SASE. [Cato SASE Cloud](https://www.catonetworks.com/resources/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-sase-platforms-2025/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-infosec&utm_campaign=20250811) is:

* A single, converged, cloud-native platform built from the ground up
* Designed to eliminate decades of complexity and sprawl—not add to it
* Real agility, performance, and security at scale

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Trend Micro Confirms Active Exploitation of Critical Apex One Flaws in On-Premise Systems (3 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/trend-micro-confirms-active.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Trend Micro confirmed active exploitation of two critical command injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-54948 and CVE-2025-54987) in on-premise Apex One Management Console. Rated 9.4 CVSS, the flaws allow pre-authenticated remote attackers to upload malicious code and execute commands on affected installations through insufficient input validation. Mitigations are available via the fix tool, with formal patches expected mid-August 2025, though the fix disables Remote Install Agent functionality.

[### Vibe Coding Tool Cursor's MCP Implementation Allows Persistent Code Execution (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/05/mcpoison_bug_abuses_cursor_mcp/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Check Point researchers uncovered a new remote code execution vulnerability in Cursor. The vulnerability, dubbed MCPoison, is caused by Cursor allowing an MCP configuration that has been previously approved to be updated without requiring a new approval. In this attack, an attacker could introduce a benign MCP and then, once it's approved, modify it to perform RCE or other malicious activity.

[### Critical Zero-Days Crack Open CyberArk and HashiCorp Password Vaults (5 minute read)](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/critical-zero-day-bugs-cyberark-hashicorp-password-vaults?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A team of researchers discovered nine zero-days in HashiCorp Vault and five in CyberArk Conjur, which they were able to chain to achieve RCE against both platforms. The researchers discovered that they could trick Conjur into performing authentication against their own server instead of an AWS server and then escalate privileges by authenticating as a policy instead of a user. Conjur's “Policy Factory” also allows for embedding Ruby in policies, leading to RCE. The HashiCorp Vault vulnerabilities included username enumeration, authentication lockout bypasses, MFA and certificate authentication bypasses, and a privilege escalation from admin to root, which could allow for RCE.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Why Is Preventative Security So Difficult? (10 minute read)](https://kanenarraway.com/posts/why-is-preventative-security-so-difficult/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

While tools for detecting vulnerabilities are plentiful, there are very few tools that seek to preventively eliminate full classes of vulnerabilities. Preventative tooling is complex because often big tech giants are the only ones equipped with the resources to address the root causes, but they are not incentivized to aid their competitors, environments differ, and new standards struggle to garner support. AI tooling may aid in allowing for more catered automations, but it is unlikely to fully eliminate issues.

[### Prompt injection engineering for attackers: Exploiting GitHub Copilot (10 minute read)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/08/06/prompt-injection-engineering-for-attackers-exploiting-github-copilot/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

This post demonstrates a prompt injection attack against GitHub Copilot, where attackers file malicious issues with hidden prompts in HTML `picture` tags, causing Copilot to insert backdoors when assigned to implement fixes. The attack leverages fake conversation history to manipulate the AI agent into secretly executing a malicious bash script disguised as a “security setup,” ultimately installing backdoored dependencies that accept commands via HTTP headers. The technique exploits Copilot's inability to distinguish legitimate from injected XML tags. Maintainers rarely scrutinize package lock file modifications during code review.

[### Researchers design “promptware” attack with Google Calendar to turn Gemini evil (4 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/08/researchers-use-calendar-events-to-hack-gemini-control-smart-home-gadgets/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Researchers demonstrate a “promptware” attack using malicious Google Calendar events to manipulate Gemini AI into controlling smart home devices. The exploit uses indirect prompt injection via calendar descriptions, triggering real-world actions. Google has now patched the flaw, adding protections and confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions.

### Launches & Tools

[### Faction (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/factionsecurity/faction?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

FACTION automates penetration testing reports, peer reviews, change tracking, customized DOCX templates, and enables real-time collaboration.

[### NovaHypervisor (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Idov31/NovaHypervisor?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

NovaHypervisor is an open-source Type-1 hypervisor designed specifically for x64 Intel systems that operates below the kernel level to provide enhanced security protection. It creates a virtualized environment that can monitor and defend against sophisticated kernel-level attacks by protecting critical system structures like Exception Frame Records (EFR) and kernel memory layouts. This defensive hypervisor technology enables real-time detection and prevention of rootkits, kernel exploits, and other advanced persistent threats that traditional security solutions running at the kernel level might miss.

[### Researchers Uncover ECScape Flaw in Amazon ECS Enabling Cross-Task Credential Theft (3 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/researchers-uncover-ecscape-flaw-in.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

“ECScape” is a flaw in Amazon ECS on EC2 that allows low-privilege containers to steal credentials from higher-privilege tasks on the same instance, enabling privilege escalation and lateral movement. Amazon advises isolating tasks, using AWS Fargate for true separation, and enforcing least-privilege policies to mitigate risks.
