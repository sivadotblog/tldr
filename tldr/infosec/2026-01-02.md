### Strategies & Tactics

[### Making CloudFlare Workers Work for Red Teams (9 minute read)](https://blog.zsec.uk/capd/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Cloudflare Workers can provide a serverless, rapidly adaptable platform for Conditional Access Payload Delivery (CAPD). Authentication can be achieved via a custom header, and the system can be enhanced by supplying secrets as environment variables, using more generic error codes, or by using timing-safe comparisons. The post also details detection opportunities for defenders.

[### Equifax Europe CISO: Notorious breach spurred cybersecurity transformation (13 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109026/javier-checa-equifax-now-the-security-culture-is-part-of-our-dna-as-a-company.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Equifax Continental Europe CISO Javier Checa detailed the company's $3 billion transformation following the 2017 breach that compromised 147 million records, including a complete cloud migration, zero legacy systems, and embedding security culture across all 300 cybersecurity specialists, plus company-wide employee bonus structures tied to security metrics. The company built its recovery strategy on transparency and collaboration, publishing annual security reports with incident-response metrics and sharing security control frameworks publicly, while neutralizing 15 million daily threats (175 per second, up 25% from 2023). Security teams should adopt hybrid defense strategies combining AI-powered tools with traditional signature-based protections, implement biometric authentication to counter deepfake attacks, and ensure CISO representation on management committees to maintain strategic alignment between security investments and business objectives.

[### Singularity: Deep Dive into a Modern Stealth Linux Kernel Rootkit (67 minute read)](https://blog.kyntra.io/Singularity-A-final-boss-linux-kernel-rootkit?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Singularity demonstrates advanced Linux rootkit tactics by leveraging legitimate kernel features (ftrace) for syscall hooking and implementing defense-in-depth across processes, filesystems, network layers, and logging systems. The rootkit's dual-architecture support (x86\_64 and ia32) prevent a common detection bypass in which investigators use 32-bit binaries to circumvent 64-bit-only hooks. Comprehensive anti-forensics capabilities, including log sanitization, taint flag manipulation, and module auto-hiding, render traditional detection methods ineffective. Defenders should adopt memory-based forensics techniques, monitor ftrace hook signatures in kernel debug interfaces, test with both 32-bit and 64-bit tools, and recognize that filesystem-based security checks can be completely intercepted by kernel-level adversaries.

[### MongoDB Unauthenticated Attacker Sensitive Memory Leak (4 minute read)](https://www.ox.security/blog/attackers-could-exploit-zlib-to-exfiltrate-data-cve-2025-14847/#technical_analysis?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A critical flaw in MongoDB's use of the zlib compression library allows network attackers to leak sensitive data from server memory without requiring authentication. By sending specially crafted compressed messages, they can gradually extract user information, passwords, and API keys from affected MongoDB versions. Updating to patched releases, closing unnecessary ports, and disabling zlib compression where possible are key steps to reduce exposure.

[### Coupang announces $1.18 billion compensation to South Korean users for data leak (3 minute read)](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/coupang-announces-118-billion-compensation-south-korea-users-data-leak-2025-12-29/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

South Korean Coupang will distribute 50,000 won vouchers to 33.7 million account holders after a data leak, totaling 1.69 trillion won ($1.18 billion). Critics say the vouchers, usable only on Coupang, turn a privacy crisis into marketing and don't reflect the breach's seriousness, sparking parliamentary hearings and consumer anger.
