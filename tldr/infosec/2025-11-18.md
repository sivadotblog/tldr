### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Cornerstone staffing ransomware attack leaks 120,000 resumes, claims Qilin gang (3 minute read)](https://cybernews.com/security/cornerstone-staffing-ransomware-attack-qilin-group-exposes-resumes/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Qilin ransomware group breached Cornerstone Staffing Solutions, exfiltrating 300GB, including 120,000 resumes, SSNs, employee salary data, and internal financial records. The Russian-linked group has become 2025's most active ransomware operation with 991 victims since 2023, employing double extortion tactics and recently allying with LockBit and DragonForce. Security teams should expect increased targeting of staffing agencies and organizations storing large volumes of PII. Threat actors are leveraging the stolen resumes for sophisticated phishing campaigns.

[### Logitech Confirms Data Breach Following Designation as Oracle Hack Victim (2 minute read)](https://www.securityweek.com/logitech-confirms-data-breach-following-designation-as-oracle-hack-victim/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Logitech has acknowledged a data breach after being listed by Cl0p ransomware, but did not confirm a connection to Oracle. The attack likely exploited a zero-day vulnerability in third-party software, allowing some employee, consumer, customer, and supplier information to have been copied. No sensitive data, such as IDs or credit cards, appears to have been affected.

[### Eurofiber admits crooks swiped data from French unit after cyberattack (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/17/eurofiber_breach/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Eurofiber's French branch suffered a cyberattack on November 13 that exposed company data through a vulnerability in its ticket platform.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Bypassing WiFi Client Isolation (8 minute read)](https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/articles/bypassing-wifi-client-isolation?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Client isolation is a security feature that prevents devices connected to the same network from communicating directly with each other. A device can spoof WiFi frames with the From-DS to bypass the Access Point (AP) and make a client think the communication is coming from the distribution system instead of directly from a client. In an encrypted network, the attacker will also need to spoof the WPA 4-way handshake or use a tool like aircrack-ng to deauthenticate a victim device.

[### Using AWS Secrets Manager Agent with Amazon EKS (5 minute read)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/using-aws-secrets-manager-agent-with-amazon-eks/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

AWS Secrets Manager Agent simplifies the retrieval of secrets in EKS clusters. The Secrets Manager Agent is a client-side agent that retrieves and caches secrets in your compute environment, allowing applications to consume secrets directly through an in-memory cache via a local HTTP endpoint. The agent implements pod identity to provide authentication and access control.

[### Five plead guilty to helping North Koreans infiltrate US firms (3 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/five-plead-guilty-to-helping-north-koreans-infiltrate-us-firms/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Five individuals pleaded guilty to facilitating North Korean IT worker infiltration schemes that compromised 136 US companies and generated over $2.2 million for the DPRK regime through stolen and false identities. The operation involved identity theft from 18 US persons, salary funneling to North Korea, and data exfiltration. Meanwhile, the DOJ separately moved to seize $15 million in cryptocurrency stolen by APT38/Lazarus from four 2023 exchange heists totaling $382 million. Organizations should strengthen identity verification for remote workers, implement behavioral analytics to detect credential sharing or anomalous access patterns, and monitor for data exfiltration to foreign adversary infrastructure.
