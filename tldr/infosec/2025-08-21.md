[### Vendor-defined rules and flashy UIs will only get you so far: embracing Detection-as-Code (Sponsor)](https://www.fastly.com/blog/smarter-security-operations-embracing-detection-as-code?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=tldr-infosec&amp;utm_campaign=20250821)

Security UIs feel great when you have a handful of rules to manage. Then you start to notice the cracks: no version control, no testing, poor collaboration… Sound familiar?

The better alternative is to apply development practices to security rules. This [blog](https://www.fastly.com/blog/smarter-security-operations-embracing-detection-as-code?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-infosec&utm_campaign=20250821) covers:

* A detection-as-code approach using Git for rule versioning, CI/CD for deployment, and automated testing for validation.
* [Fastly's WAF Simulator](https://www.fastly.com/blog/smarter-security-operations-embracing-detection-as-code?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-infosec&utm_campaign=20250821) that tests rules against both attack scenarios and legitimate traffic before deployment.
* Why effective detection engineering can't rely solely on vendor-provided defaults

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Don't want drive-by Ollama attackers snooping on your local chats? Patch now (3 minute read)](https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/08/19/ollama_driveby_attack/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A vulnerability in Ollama Desktop v0.10.0 allowed drive-by attacks where malicious websites could bypass CORS controls to reconfigure victims' local AI settings remotely, intercept all chat messages, and even serve poisoned models. GitLab's Chris Moberly discovered the flaw by exploiting incomplete cross-origin controls—removing the Content-Type header to trick the app into treating malicious requests as "simple" and bypassing preflight checks. The vulnerability was patched within hours in v0.10.1 after Moberly disclosed it on July 31. Users are urged to update immediately as exploitation would be "trivial," according to the researcher.

[### Hackers Steal Microsoft Logins Using Legitimate ADFS Redirects (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-steal-microsoft-logins-using-legitimate-adfs-redirects/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Push Security researchers found a new phishing attack using legit office.com links combined with ADFS to redirect users to a phishing page that steals Microsoft 365 logins. The attack starts when users click on malicious sponsored links in Google search results for Office 265 (likely typosquatting), which leads to Microsoft's office.com, then to a harmless-looking page that redirects to the phishing site. The attackers are using a custom Microsoft tenant with ADFS to receive authorization requests for the fake domain.

[### Apache ActiveMQ Flaw Exploited to Deploy DripDropper Malware on Cloud Linux Systems (3 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/apache-activemq-flaw-exploited-to.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Threat actors are exploiting a two-year-old critical Apache ActiveMQ vulnerability (CVE-2023-46604, CVSS 10.0) to deploy DripDropper malware on cloud Linux systems, then patching the flaw post-compromise to block other attackers and evade detection. The attackers use the PyInstaller-based DripDropper to establish persistence through modified SSH configurations and cron jobs, while leveraging legitimate services like Dropbox and Cloudflare Tunnels for command-and-control communications.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### How I Hacked McDonald's (Their Security Contact Was Harder to Find Than Their Secret Sauce Recipe) (7 minute read)](https://bobdahacker.com/blog/mcdonalds-security-vulnerabilities?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The author of this post uncovered several vulnerabilities at McDonald's, like weak app and portal security, exposed API keys, and user data leaks. Despite attempts to report the issues, finding someone to listen was nearly impossible—the process required calling HQ and guessing employee names. Most bugs were fixed once reported, but communication and security practices at McDonald's were deeply flawed.

[### Cryptoagility: the strategic pillar for digital resilience (3 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4041829/cryptoagility-the-strategic-pillar-for-digital-resilience.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Cryptoagility, defined as the ability to replace cryptographic algorithms, keys, and certificates quickly, has become vital for organizations managing critical infrastructure, as shown by Google's Chromecast failure that affected millions when a certificate expired. Organizations must shift from reactive to proactive certificate management, using modular infrastructure, centralized PKI/HSM, and automated rotation aligned with PCI DSS v4.0 and DORA. This forward-looking approach makes cryptographic flexibility a strategic advantage, ensuring operational continuity and compliance before vulnerabilities or expirations cause system failures.

[### Microsoft Entra Private Access brings conditional access to on-prem Active Directory (5 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4041752/microsoft-entra-private-access-brings-conditional-access-to-on-prem-active-directory.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Microsoft's Entra Private Access now allows organizations to apply cloud-based conditional access and MFA to on-premises Active Directory domain controllers, replacing legacy VPNs with Zero Trust Network Access. It requires networks to be NTLM-free and Kerberos-only, Windows 10+ devices that are Entra or hybrid joined, opening TCP port 1337 on domain controllers, and extensive NTLM auditing and removal. Organizations must audit NTLM usage via Group Policy, transition to NTLMv2 or Kerberos, and possibly retire legacy apps before implementing this security framework.

Accounts of project maintainers publishing software on PyPI are linked to email addresses, which in some cases may be tied to a custom domain name. Historically, attackers have been able to take over some projects by resurrecting an expired domain that was attached to a maintainer's email and resetting the account. PyPI has added new checks that will mark an email as unverified if a domain is expired or is about to expire.

The Dire Wolf ransomware has affected 16 organizations across 11 countries since it emerged in May, using double-extortion tactics, such as encrypting data while threatening leaks. The Golang-based ransomware uses anti-forensics techniques and multi-stage attack chains to evade detection, mainly targeting manufacturing and technology sectors through phishing and credential stuffing attacks.
