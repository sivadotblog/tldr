### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Cisco warns of IOS zero-day vulnerability exploited in attacks (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-warns-of-ios-zero-day-vulnerability-exploited-in-attacks/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Cisco has released security updates for CVE-2025-20352, a high-severity zero-day vulnerability in IOS and IOS XE software that's being actively exploited in the wild. The flaw stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in the SNMP subsystem, allowing authenticated attackers to trigger DoS conditions or achieve root-level code execution on vulnerable devices. Cisco strongly recommends upgrading to patched versions immediately, as no workarounds exist beyond limiting SNMP access to trusted users.

[### State-Sponsored Hackers Exploiting Libraesva Email Security Gateway Vulnerability (2 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/state-sponsored-hackers-exploiting.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Libraesva has patched CVE-2025-59689, a command injection vulnerability in its Email Security Gateway with a CVSS score of 6.1, after discovering state-sponsored threat actors were actively exploiting it. The flaw can be triggered by malicious emails, allowing attackers to execute commands on the affected system. Organizations using Libraesva ESG should immediately apply the available security update to prevent exploitation.

[### Large-Scale Attack Targeting Macs via GitHub Pages Impersonating Companies to Attempt to Deliver Stealer Malware (2 minute read)](https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/attack-targeting-macs-via-github-pages?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Attackers created fraudulent GitHub Pages impersonating over 100 companies (including LastPass, 1Password, financial institutions, and tech firms) using SEO to rank high in search results and trick Mac users into downloading fake software installers. The malicious sites redirect victims through multiple layers to ultimately execute a terminal command that downloads Atomic Stealer malware, which harvests credentials and sensitive data from infected systems. The campaign leverages trusted GitHub infrastructure and creates multiple backup repositories under different usernames to evade takedown efforts while targeting a broad range of high-value software applications.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### ReDisclosure: New technique for exploiting Full-Text Search in MySQL (myBB case study) (8 minute read)](https://exploit.az/posts/wor/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Researchers have discovered a new regular expression (regex) injection method that exploits MySQL's Full-Text Search (FTS) boolean mode operators to bypass input sanitization. This technique utilizes characters like \* and +, which have different meanings in FTS versus regex. The attack extracts sensitive data without breaking SQL syntax, demonstrated in CVE-2025-48941 in myBB, where attackers could enumerate deleted thread titles by observing search redirects instead of error messages. This is risky because FTS functions are often unsanitized, as developers don't view them as regular expressions, and the payloads can evade WAFs and security scanners.

[### Project Rain:L1TF (13 minute read)](https://bughunters.google.com/blog/4684191115575296/project-rain-l1tf?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

L1TF Reloaded is a complex attack chain that uses half-Spectre gadgets to load data into L1 cache and L1 Terminal Fault to read cross-VM secrets via kernel data structures, breaking KASLR and extracting TLS keys. Google responded with Address Space Isolation (ASI), removing sensitive memory from kernel space during VM execution and mapping it during controlled transitions with buffer clearing. The attack highlights how speculative execution vulnerabilities can bypass privilege boundaries in virtualized environments, emphasizing the need for comprehensive architectural defenses beyond piecemeal mitigations.

[### Bookworm to Stately Taurus Using the Unit 42 Attribution Framework (13 minute read)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/bookworm-to-stately-taurus/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 linked the Bookworm malware family to the Chinese APT group Stately Taurus by analyzing shared artifacts, including PDB paths, infrastructure, and targeting of Southeast Asian governments. Using the Admiralty System, they scored evidence reliability, reaching a confidence score of 58.4 based on toolsets, victim profiles, timelines from 2015-2022, and environment fingerprints. This case shows how structured attribution enables evidence-based threat actor identification, improving cybersecurity intelligence.

[### Another BRICKSTORM: Stealthy Backdoor Enabling Espionage into Tech and Legal Sectors (12 minute read)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/brickstorm-espionage-campaign?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

China-nexus threat actor UNC5221 uses BRICKSTORM backdoors on network appliances and VMware infrastructure to maintain persistent access, averaging 393 days undetected. The actor employs sophisticated tactics, including VM cloning to extract credentials offline, credential harvesting via BRICKSTEAL servlet filters, and legitimate tool abuse to access M365 mailboxes and secret vaults. Organizations should inventory unmonitored appliances, hunt for unusual internet traffic from management interfaces, and monitor for VM cloning activities and suspicious SSH enablement on virtualization platforms.

[### CISA says hackers breached federal agency using GeoServer exploit (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-says-hackers-breached-federal-agency-using-geoserver-exploit/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Attackers exploited CVE-2024-36401, a critical GeoServer RCE vulnerability, to breach a US federal agency. They maintained access for three weeks before detection. The threat actors deployed China Chopper webshells, moved laterally to web and SQL servers, and used brute force techniques for privilege escalation and credential harvesting. Organizations should prioritize patching critical vulnerabilities in CISA's KEV catalog and ensure continuous EDR monitoring, as over 16,000 GeoServer instances remain exposed online.

[### SolarWinds fixes Web Help Desk patch bypass for actively exploited flaw — again (2 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4061929/solarwinds-fixes-web-help-desk-patch-bypass-for-actively-exploited-flaw-again.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

SolarWinds issued a third patch for the critical Java deserialization vulnerability in Web Help Desk, CVE-2025-26399 bypasses CVE-2024-28988, which bypassed the original CVE-2024-28986 flaw. This CVE affects the AjaxProxy component, allowing unauthenticated remote code execution. Trend Micro researchers found each patch bypass. Experts warn that patch bypasses are common with blacklist approaches and predict that this could be exploited, given its history of active exploitation.
