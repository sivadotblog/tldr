[### 43% of organizations have fewer than 5 staff members handling compliance (Sponsor)](https://www.onetrust.com/resources/tldr-csyn/the-risk-resilient-enterprise-automating-compliance-for-security-and-scale/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=tldr-infosec&amp;utm_campaign=20250902)

Meanwhile, compliance requirements keep expanding. New regulations emerge annually across privacy, financial controls, and cyber resilience. Each framework demands separate audits, evidence collection, and documentation — even when [requirements overlap significantly](https://www.onetrust.com/resources/tldr-csyn/the-risk-resilient-enterprise-automating-compliance-for-security-and-scale/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-infosec&utm_campaign=20250902).

Beyond the obvious resource drain, this creates strategic blind spots when compliance teams operate in silos, miss shared controls, and duplicate work across frameworks that share common ground.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### s1ngularity: Supply Chain Attack Leaks Secrets on GitHub (4 minute read)](https://www.wiz.io/blog/s1ngularity-supply-chain-attack?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Multiple malicious versions of the popular Nx build system package were published to NPM on August 26. The attack leveraged AI command line tools to search for sensitive files, extracted credentials, and then attempted lockout by appending `sudo shutdown -h 0` to .bashrc and .zshrc files. The root cause of the supply chain attack was a flawed GitHub Action that allowed code injection through unsanitized PR titles combined with the `pull\_request\_target` trigger.

[### Fraudster stole over $1.5 million from city of Baltimore (2 minute read)](https://securityaffairs.com/181772/cyber-crime/fraudster-stole-over-1-5-million-from-city-of-baltimore.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A fraudster stole $1.5 million from Baltimore between February and March by pretending to be a vendor employee, hacking into the vendor's Workday account, and convincing AP staff to redirect bank details. The city recovered $721,000, but cannot recover $803,000 despite insurance claims and reissued payments. This is Baltimore's third instance of vendor fraud since 2019, highlighting ongoing weaknesses in financial controls following losses of $62,000 in 2019 and $376,000 in 2022.

[### Google warns that mass data theft hitting Salesloft AI agent has grown bigger (3 minute read)](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/google-warns-that-mass-data-theft-hitting-salesloft-ai-agent-has-grown-bigger/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The data theft affecting Drift AI, a Salesloft tool, is more extensive than initially reported. Attackers used compromised credentials to access Google Workspace emails, and as a result, all Salesloft Drift integrations are now considered potentially compromised. Organizations must revoke and rotate all connected credentials and check for unauthorized access.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Rage Against the Authentication State Machine (6 minute read)](https://blog.silentsignal.eu/2025/06/14/gitblit-cve-CVE-2024-28080/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Researchers discovered an authentication bypass (CVE-2024-28080) in Gitblit's SSH service that allows attackers to log in without requiring a user's private key or password, only needing the username and public key. This post analyzes how the vulnerability arose, detailing the SSH login handshake and highlighting where the implementation deviates from secure best practices with Apache MINA SSHD.

[### CVSS is Built for Code, Not AI Agents. Now AIVSS Closes the Gap (4 minute read)](https://checkmarx.com/ai-llm-tools-in-application-security/cvss-was-built-for-code-not-ai-agents-now-aivss-closes-the-gap/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Traditional CVSS scores fail to address the unique risks posed by autonomous AI agents. The new AIVSS framework extends CVSS by evaluating behavioral factors—such as autonomy, tool access, and memory use—enabling security teams to measure and manage the risks of agentic AI systems more effectively, aligning with modern security frameworks like NIST AI RMF.

[### The Resurgence of IoT Malware: Inside the Mirai-Based Botnet Campaign (7 minute read)](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/iot-malware-gayfemboy-mirai-based-botnet-campaign?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The Gayfemboy botnet exploits vulnerabilities in DrayTek, TP-Link, Raisecom, and Cisco devices to deploy a Mirai-variant that uses modified UPX packing, custom architecture naming schemes, and hardcoded process termination lists to eliminate competing malware infections. The malware implements sophisticated evasion techniques, including 50-nanosecond sandbox delays, utilizes public DNS servers (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8) to bypass local filtering, and scans 15 predefined ports for C2 communication with domains such as cross-compiling[.]org and i-kiss-boys[.]com. Organizations should implement network monitoring for unusual DNS queries to public resolvers, deploy IPS signatures for the listed CVEs, and monitor for processes attempting to bind to UDP port 47272 or exhibiting the malware's distinctive process termination behavior.

[### Whistleblower Says Trump Officials Copied Millions of Social Security Numbers (3 minute read)](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/26/nx-s1-5517977/social-security-doge-privacy?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A whistleblower at the Social Security Administration (SSA) stated that a former senior DOGE official, now at the SSA, copied the Social Security Numbers (SSNs), names, and dates of birth of over 300 million Americans to a private section of the agency's AWS cloud environment. The complaint states that the cloud environment was set up for DOGE-affiliated Social Security staffers but lacks independent security, monitoring, and oversight. The complaint also alleges that cybersecurity officials within the SSA described the decision to copy the data as “very high risk” and discussed the possibility of having to reissue SSNs in the event of a breach.
