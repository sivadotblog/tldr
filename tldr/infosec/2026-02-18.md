## Typo Firefox RCE 🦊, CISA's BeyondTrust Patch Deadline 🚨, Kernel Rootkits Blind eBPF Security Tools 👁️

[### Your Breach Started in AWS. Spread to Azure. Exfiltrated From GCP and headed to your private data center. And you're still logging Into 3 Consoles (Sponsor)](https://www.illumio.com/insights-free-trial?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_adgroup=insights_week1)

Attackers don't respect cloud boundaries — they pivot across your AWS, Azure, and GCP environments in minutes. That's because your security tools are still siloed by cloud providers.

[Illumio Insights](https://www.illumio.com/insights-free-trial?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_adgroup=insights_week1) shows the complete attack path across all your clouds:

* One map for everything. See cross-cloud lateral movement in real-time, not pieced together days later.
* Detect when dev in AWS talks to prod in Azure over unauthorized protocols.
* Find the servers you didn't know existed (such as acquisitions, shadow IT, forgotten test environments).
* Stop multi-cloud attacks at the first hop and quarantine before they pivot on to another cloud environment.

Your SOC stops hunting across consoles. And your attackers stop getting multiple chances to succeed.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Indian pharmacy chain giant exposed customer data and internal systems (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/indias-major-pharmacy-chain-exposed-customer-data-and-internal-systems/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A misconfigured “super admin” interface at DavaIndia Pharmacy, part of Zota Healthcare, allowed anyone to create high-privilege accounts and access data on nearly 17,000 online orders across 883 stores, including names, contacts, addresses, and purchased medicines. Attackers could have altered pricing, discounts, and prescription requirements before the flaw, reported to CERT-In in August 2025, was quietly fixed.

[### How I "hacked" ChatGPT Atlas... and why it wasn't patched (6 minute read)](https://wts.dev/posts/chatgpt-atlas-bug/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A researcher discovered that ChatGPT Atlas's OWL architecture allows local attackers to replace the headless Chromium "OWL Host" with a malicious app, inheriting Atlas's macOS TCC privileges to silently access the microphone, camera, or other permissions previously granted by the user. OpenAI declined to patch the bug, citing Chrome's threat model, which excludes local attacks—a stance inherited downstream by Electron and Chromium forks that the researcher argues leaves macOS users fundamentally less secure. The unpatched vulnerability highlights a growing tension between Chrome's threat-model assumptions and macOS's TCC permission system, in which confused deputy attacks can bypass OS-level consent controls without user awareness.

[### How a single typo led to RCE in Firefox (11 minute read)](https://kqx.io/post/firefox0day/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A single-character typo (using `&` instead of `|`) in a SpiderMonkey Wasm GC array refactoring commit introduced a use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox's renderer process, enabling arbitrary read/write primitives and full code execution. The bug caused out-of-line array forwarding pointers to be incorrectly zeroed during garbage collection, allowing attackers to reclaim freed memory via heap spraying, bypass ASLR through pointer leaks, and hijack control flow. The vulnerability affected only Firefox 149 Nightly and was patched within six days of the report. No release versions were affected.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### A Standardization Guide to Prompt Injection (11 minute read)](https://www.lasso.security/blog/prompt-injection-taxonomy-techniques?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Lasso proposes a structured taxonomy for prompt injection, distinguishing between attacker intent (system prompt leakage vs. jailbreak) and text-based techniques, including instruction override, role-playing, and others. Each category includes concrete subtypes and examples to help practitioners more reliably detect, reason about, and defend against modern LLM prompt attacks.

[### Inside Bashe: The Interview with the Ransomware Group Known as APT73 (8 minute read)](https://www.suspectfile.com/inside-bashe-the-interview-with-the-ransomware-group-known-as-apt73/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Bashe (formerly APT73) is a RaaS group rebranded around a Chinese mythological serpent identity. It operates with a 0.25 BTC affiliate entry fee as both a monetization and anti-infiltration measure, and collaborates with initial access brokers and disgruntled corporate insiders. The group claims full-stack encryption, EDR bypass capabilities, and centralized control over negotiation panels and data publication timers, while excluding healthcare, schools, and CIS countries from targeting. This pattern is consistent with norms in the Russian-speaking ransomware ecosystem. Their deliberate vagueness on technical specifics such as key management architecture, combined with profit-first rhetoric and a shifting geographic focus toward countries with higher payment rates, provides useful threat intelligence for defenders modeling RaaS operator behavior.

[### Breaking eBPF Security: How Kernel Rootkits Blind Observability Tools (16 minute read)](https://matheuzsecurity.github.io/hacking/ebpf-security-tools-hacking/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Research has shown that kernel rootkits can systematically blind eBPF-based security tools by using ftrace to hook the data-delivery plumbing, BPF iterators, ring buffers, perf events, and map operations, rather than targeting the eBPF programs themselves. The Singularity rootkit selectively filters hidden processes and network connections at the kernel-to-userspace boundary, causing security tools to operate on a fabricated view of system state while believing they have complete visibility. The findings underscore that eBPF observability assumes a trusted kernel, and defenders must prioritize preventing kernel compromise through Secure Boot, signed module enforcement, and layered out-of-host detection rather than relying solely on kernel-level telemetry.

[### LazyDLLSideload (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Whitecat18/LazyDLLSideload?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

LazyDLLSideload is a Rust-based tool for generating DLL proxy and sideload projects for red team engagements, automatically parsing PE export tables and producing ready-to-compile implants with payload embedding, string obfuscation, and dynamic invocation via dyncvoke. It supports two modes: sideload (pure DLL replacement with stub exports) and proxy (forwarding calls to the renamed original DLL while intercepting a specified function), with optional native syscall execution via NtCreateThreadEx for improved OPSEC.

An infostealer, likely a Vidar variant, exfiltrated OpenClaw config files containing gateway tokens, device keys, and an AI agent “soul,” enabling remote access and identity hijacking. Meanwhile, malicious ClawHub skills, exposed OpenClaw instances with RCE potential, and persistent Moltbook accounts are growing attacker interest as OpenClaw's ecosystem rapidly scales.

[### Securing Digital Assets in an Evolving Threat Landscape: The Fireblocks Defense-in-Depth Approach to Security (29 minute read)](https://www.fireblocks.com/report/the-fireblocks-defense-in-depth-approach-to-security?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Fireblocks published a comprehensive whitepaper detailing the blockchain threat landscape, where over $17 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen since 2020, with DPRK-linked actors accounting for approximately $6.75 billion and three-quarters of all attacks on crypto platforms. The paper outlines a defense-in-depth architecture combining zero-trust infrastructure, MPC-based distributed key management, multi-device transaction approval, and real-time DeFi threat detection to mitigate attack vectors, including spear phishing, API compromise, blind signing, and address poisoning. Security teams managing digital assets should evaluate their own controls against the included readiness assessment, particularly ensuring no single compromised component — whether an endpoint, admin account, or cloud environment — can enable unauthorized fund movement.
