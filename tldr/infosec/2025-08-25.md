## Booking.com Sneaky Phishing 🎣, Claude Security Vibe Check 🤖, AWS Trusted Advisor Tricked 👻

[### You (probably) shouldn't be giving users local admin permissions (Sponsor)](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/elevation-control?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=sponsor&amp;utm_campaign=elevation_control_q3_25&amp;utm_content=elevation_control&amp;utm_term=newsletter)

Many organizations solve software installation problems by handing out local admin rights. This generally “works” in terms of getting software installed, at the cost of creating a massive security threat.

Want to stay efficient without rolling out the red carpet for attackers?

Elevate applications instead of users with [ThreatLocker Elevation Control](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/elevation-control?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=sponsor&utm_campaign=elevation_control_q3_25&utm_content=elevation_control&utm_term=newsletter) - a policy-based endpoint privilege management that puts IT and security in the driver's seat.

>> Execute approved software as a local admin without entering credentials

>> Revoke local admin rights from users

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Booking.com phishing campaign uses sneaky 'ん' character to trick you (1 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bookingcom-phishing-campaign-uses-sneaky-character-to-trick-you/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Attackers are using the Japanese hiragana character 'ん' (n) in phishing domains to impersonate Booking.com, creating URLs that appear legitimate but redirect victims to credential-stealing sites. The campaign exploits how the character renders similarly to the Latin 'n' in many fonts, making malicious domains harder to detect. Users should verify URLs carefully and avoid clicking links in unsolicited emails claiming to be from Booking.com.

[### Over 300 entities hit by a variant of Atomic macOS Stealer in recent campaign (1 minute read)](https://securityaffairs.com/181441/malware/over-300-entities-hit-by-a-variant-of-atomic-macos-stealer-in-recent-campaign.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Over 300 entities were infected by SHAMOS, a variant of the Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), through malvertising campaigns between June and August. The malware steals passwords stored in Keychain, browser data, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive information from infected macOS systems. The campaign used malicious advertisements to distribute the stealer, targeting Mac users with fake software downloads.

[### 90K exposed after sleep therapy provider data breach (2 minute read)](https://cybernews.com/privacy/cpap-medical-military-sleep-therapy-breach/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

CPAP Medical Supplies, a company that serves mainly military personnel, suffered a hack between December 13 and 21 that exposed over 90,000 individuals' sensitive data. The breach created risks of identity and medical fraud. Affected customers have been offered monitoring services. CPAP Medical Supplies has stressed that there has been no evidence of misuse so far.

[### Do Claude Code Security Reviews Pass the Vibe Check? (5 minute read)](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/do-claude-code-security-reviews-pass-vibe-check?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Anthropic's Claude platform has introduced AI-powered code security reviews, which can make detecting common vulnerabilities easier and more integrated for developers. While these tools provide helpful automation for identifying issues like SQL injection and authentication flaws, they are not foolproof and miss complex bugs. Human expertise, comprehensive security practices, and additional testing are still necessary to achieve safe and secure application development in the fast-evolving landscape of AI-assisted coding.

[### The Silent, Fileless Threat of VShell (8 minute read)](https://www.trellix.com/blogs/research/the-silent-fileless-threat-of-vshell/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Attackers embed base64-encoded Bash commands in RAR filenames that run automatically during directory listing with unsafe patterns like eval "echo $f" or for f in \*. The attack downloads loaders specific to architecture that fetch XOR-encrypted VShell backdoor payloads, decrypts them in memory, and executes as fake kernel threads such as [kworker/0:2] to evade detection. This method bypasses defenses because antivirus doesn't scan filenames, the malware doesn't touch disk after decryption, and execution happens via common shell operations without needing executable permissions.

[### Introducing Unit 42's Attribution Framework (16 minute read)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-attribution-framework/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Unit 42's three-tier attribution framework tracks threats from activity clusters to named threat actors, requiring rigorous evidence like Diamond Model mapping and Admiralty System scoring for source reliability (A-F) and credibility (1-6). It mandates six-month observation, multiple sources, and TTP analysis before tier promotion, preventing premature attribution and enabling focused tracking. Default scores apply to common artifacts, with analyst adjustments and review board validation.

[### rre-burp (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/jumpycastle/rre-burp?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The RRE Burp extension automates detecting Recursive Request Exploits by tracing API call chains from protected resources to find unauthenticated upstream APIs exploitable to bypass access controls. It uses Shannon entropy analysis (default threshold 3.0) to identify valuable backend tokens and parameters, then traces requests to find low-trust inputs that produce these high-value outputs. Demonstrated at DEF CON 33, it scales to find vulnerabilities across streaming services ("Streamageddon"), revealing how API chain flaws can bypass paywalls.

[### Tiny quantum dots unlock the future of unbreakable encryption (3 minute read)](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250822073814.htm?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Physicists from Hebrew University and Los Alamos Labs developed quantum encryption using imperfect quantum dot light sources, outperforming traditional laser-based systems by extending secure transmission distances by over 3 dB. The breakthrough employs a truncated decoy state and heralded purification protocols to filter multi-photon emissions in real time, removing the need for perfect single-photon sources for 40 years. Room-temperature tests showed the approach works with existing equipment, making quantum-secure communication more practical and affordable.

[### Honey, I shrunk the image and now I'm pwned (4 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/google_gemini_image_scaling_attack/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Security researchers found that Google Gemini-powered tools can be deceived by hidden prompts embedded in images, exploiting image scaling for prompt injection. This trick can cause AI to leak data or act out of bounds. Google says it's not a default vulnerability, but experts urge stronger AI system defenses and user previews.
