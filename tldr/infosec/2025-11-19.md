### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Princeton University Data Breach Impacts Alumni, Students, Employees (2 minute read)](https://www.securityweek.com/princeton-university-data-breach-impacts-alumni-students-employees/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Princeton University disclosed a data breach after a hacker accessed a database with personal details of alumni, donors, faculty, students, and parents. The attack, traced to a phishing call, compromised information like names, addresses, emails, and donation records, but not passwords or financial data.

[### EchoGram Flaw Bypasses Guardrails in Major LLMs (2 minute read)](https://hackread.com/echogram-flaw-bypass-guardrails-major-llms/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

EchoGram is a technique that exploits training data gaps in LLM guardrails by injecting “flip tokens” (nonsensical strings, such as “=coffee”) that cause both false positives and bypasses of safety controls in GPT-5.1, Claude, and Gemini. The attack is effective against both LLM-as-judge and classification-based guardrails. Researchers estimate that attackers can replicate the method within three months. Security teams face dual threats - malicious prompts that bypass defenses and legitimate requests being falsely flagged - leading to alert fatigue in critical sectors such as finance and healthcare.

[### Surveillance Tech Provider Protei Was Hacked (2 minute read)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/surveillance-tech-provider-protei-was-hacked-its-data-stolen-and-its-website-defaced/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Protei, a Russian telecom company that develops technology to enable phone and internet companies to conduct web surveillance and censorship, was hacked. The attackers defaced its website and stole 182GB of data, including confidential emails. The threat actor defaced the website with the message “another DPI/SORM provider bites the dust,” referring to the company's sales of deep packet inspection and other internet filtering technologies developed for the Russian lawful intercept system.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Stealing Microsoft Teams Access Tokens in 2025 (4 minute read)](https://blog.randorisec.fr/ms-teams-access-tokens/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Microsoft Teams stores its auth\_cookie in a DPAPI-encrypted value in the Cookie database of the embedded Chromium browser used by Teams. The key used to encrypt the cookie can be retrieved from the Local State file in the Teams cache and used in conjunction with the nonce to decrypt the auth\_cookie using AES-256-GCM. This auth\_cookie can then be used with GraphSpy to retrieve and send messages on Teams.

[### How I Overlooked the Problem and Shot Myself in the Foot (4 minute read)](https://sirantd.com/how-i-overlooked-the-problem-and-shot-myself-in-the-foot-06841414e1de?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

This author disabled and deleted Identity & Access Management (IAM) users before updating associated Terraform state and key policies while migrating from legacy IAM users to SSO in an AWS environment, inadvertently locking access to an AWS KMS key. Terraform applied changes but masked the fact that the EKS cluster continued to use the orphaned key, causing permission failures and locking out key management until AWS Support intervened. Security teams should ensure IAM and key-policy transitions are sequenced and validated, maintain Terraform state accuracy, and treat KMS keys as high-risk break-glass resources during cloud IAM migrations.

[### The realities of CISO burnout and exhaustion (4 minute read)](https://cyberscoop.com/ciso-burnout-mental-health-cybersecurity-exhaustion-op-ed/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

CISOs are facing a surge in burnout driven by accelerating threats, shrinking budgets, and increasing executive accountability for breaches. The evolving role now spans governance, risk, crisis management, and business strategy, creating sustained cognitive load and operational fatigue that raises organizational and even national-security risk. Security leaders should prioritize realistic resourcing, delegation, mental-health sustainability, and board-level alignment to ensure that essential defensive capabilities do not degrade under chronic pressure.

### Launches & Tools

[### 🆕 StrongDM launches Leash: open-source policy enforcement for AI agents (Sponsor)](https://www.strongdm.com/blog/policy-enforcement-for-agentic-ai-with-leash?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

AI agents are the fastest-growing class of identity. They're connecting to tools and systems 24/7 - requiring a new approach to access control. [Leash is StrongDM's new open-source project](https://www.strongdm.com/blog/policy-enforcement-for-agentic-ai-with-leash) that extends runtime control to agentic systems. Leash works at kernel level (<1ms latency overhead) to evaluate agent activity against human-readable guardrails. [Read the blog](https://www.strongdm.com/blog/policy-enforcement-for-agentic-ai-with-leash)

[### Nudge Security (Product Launch)](https://www.nudgesecurity.com/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Nudge Security helps organizations secure SaaS and AI usage by providing real-time visibility, risk detection, and automated policy enforcement. It uncovers risky integrations, monitors AI/data access, and addresses identity security gaps across apps and users.

[### SAMDump (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/SAMDump?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

This tool extracts offline Windows SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY registry hives and parses them to extract hashed credentials for analysis. It's intended for use by red-team or forensic practitioners to recover NTLM/LM hashes for further brute force or audit activities. Infosec professionals should treat any accessible hives as a high-risk indicator, ensure live system backup integrity, enforce privilege separation for hive access, and validate detection around unusual hive reads or exfiltration.

[### 90DaysOfCyberSecurity (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/farhanashrafdev/90DaysOfCyberSecurity?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

This repository contains a 90-day cybersecurity study plan, along with resources and materials for learning various cybersecurity concepts and technologies. The plan is organized into daily tasks and covers topics such as Network+, Security+, Linux, Python, Traffic Analysis, Git, ELK, AWS, Azure, and Hacking.
