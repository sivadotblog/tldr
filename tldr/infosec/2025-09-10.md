[### USB drives are still a problem - but they're not your only data exfiltration risk (Sponsor)](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/storage-control?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=sponsor&amp;utm_campaign=storage_control_q3_25&amp;utm_content=storage_control&amp;utm_term=newsletter)

While most organizations focus on blocking USB devices, attackers and insiders can just as easily steal data through network shares, cloud storage, or even local folder access. You need visibility and control over ALL storage access points.

[ThreatLocker Storage Control](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/storage-control?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=sponsor&utm_campaign=storage_control_q3_25&utm_content=storage_control&utm_term=newsletter) provides [granular policies across every storage type](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/storage-control?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=sponsor&utm_campaign=storage_control_q3_25&utm_content=storage_control&utm_term=newsletter) - from USB drives to network shares to local folders. Set policies as simple as "block all USBs" or as detailed as "only allow backup apps to access the backup share."

⚡ Unified audit logs every file access with device serial numbers

⚡ 60-second approval workflow for storage access requests

⚡ Granular policies by user, time, application, and device type

### Strategies & Tactics

[### GitHub Actions: A Cloudy Day for Security - Part 1 (16 minute read)](https://binarysecurity.no/posts/2025/08/securing-gh-actions-part1?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Security challenges in GitHub Actions can affect even trusted teams, as attackers may exploit workflows or inject malicious code. Using branch protection, pull request approvals, environment variable management, and safeguards like the “four-eyes” principle reduces risks. Regular reviews and testing further strengthen CI/CD pipeline security.

[### LunaLock Ransomware threatens victims by feeding stolen data to AI models (2 minute read)](https://securityaffairs.com/182014/malware/lunalock-ransomware-threatens-victims-by-feeding-stolen-data-to-ai-models.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

LunaLock, a new ransomware group, has threatened to submit stolen artwork from the Artists&Clients website to AI companies for training datasets if its $50,000 ransom demand isn't met. This approach, a unique extortion technique, represents a dangerous precedent as it compromises victims' intellectual property permanently by incorporating stolen data into AI models, unlike traditional dark web leaks that may fade over time. The attack targets artists who are already vulnerable to AI data scraping by companies like OpenAI and Google.

[### Memory Integrity Enforcement: A complete vision for memory safety in Apple devices (12 minute read)](https://security.apple.com/blog/memory-integrity-enforcement/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Apple's Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), introduced in the iPhone 17 and iPhone Air, combines secure memory allocators with Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) hardware to provide continuous memory safety against advanced spyware exploiting memory corruption. It uses hardware-enforced memory tagging to prevent buffer overflows and use-after-free attacks by assigning secret tags to memory and terminating processes when tags are incorrect. Tag Confidentiality Enforcement also defends against side-channel attacks, including Spectre V1 mitigations. Apple's tests show MIE defeats all recent real-world exploits, forcing attackers to restart development with new techniques and making memory corruption exploits more difficult and costly.

[### Nepal social media ban sparks protests, dozens injured (2 minute read)](https://therecord.media/nepal-social-media-ban-protests?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

At least 14 people were killed and dozens injured in Nepal after police clashed with "Gen Z protesters" demonstrating against the government's ban on 26 major social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Signal, YouTube, and X. The restrictions were imposed after foreign tech companies failed to register locally under new regulations, citing concerns about cybercriminals spreading disinformation with fake accounts and unregistered platforms. Rights groups condemned both the ban and the police force, calling the restrictions a "dangerous precedent for press freedom" that could harm Nepal's business and tourism sectors, heavily reliant on social media.

[### Treasury Department targets Southeast Asia scam hubs with sanctions (2 minute read)](https://cyberscoop.com/southeast-asia-scam-hubs-sanctions/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 19 individuals and organizations operating cyberscam hubs in Burma and Cambodia, responding to Americans losing at least $10 billion to Southeast Asian scam operations in 2024—a 66% increase from the previous year. The sanctions target notorious hubs like Shwe Kokko, Burma, where criminal organizations use debt bondage, violence, and threats of forced prostitution to coerce workers into conducting virtual currency investment scams and other online fraud against victims worldwide. The action aims to disrupt industrial-scale fraud operations that not only threaten Americans' financial security but also subject thousands of people to modern slavery conditions in forced labor compounds.

[### AI-Powered Celebrity Impersonation Scams: A Threat Intelligence Report by RedHunt Labs (15 minute read)](https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/ai-powered-celebrity-impersonation-scams-a-threat-intelligence-report-by-redhunt-labs/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

RedHunt Labs discovered a complex AI-driven investment scam targeting Indian users through Facebook and Instagram ads featuring deepfake videos of celebrities like Nirmala Sitharaman, Sadhguru, and Neha Kakkar promoting fake investment platforms. Victims lost an average of over ₹50,000. The scammers use deepfake technology to create convincing fake interviews and endorsements, bypassing Facebook's ad review system through short-lived campaigns and fake Amazon links. They redirect victims to counterfeit news websites impersonating major Indian media outlets like NDTV and India Today. The campaign involves a network of over 1,000 interconnected fraudulent websites and uses multiple payment methods, including UPI transfers and international bank accounts. It has expanded beyond social media to include compromised websites, fake Medium blog posts, and SEO manipulation to reach victims across multiple platforms.
