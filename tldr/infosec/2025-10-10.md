[### Cybercrime Observations from the Frontlines: UNC6040 Proactive Hardening Recommendations (18 minute read)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc6040-proactive-hardening-recommendations?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

UNC6040 is a financially motivated threat group that uses voice phishing (vishing) to trick employees into authorizing malicious Salesforce Data Loader applications, enabling large-scale data theft from corporate Salesforce instances. The attackers impersonate IT support personnel to manipulate victims into granting OAuth access to fake connected apps, then systematically exfiltrate sensitive data using legitimate Salesforce tools. Organizations should implement phishing-resistant MFA, restrict API access to approved applications only, enforce network-based login restrictions, and deploy real-time detection rules that monitor for suspicious OAuth authorizations followed by bulk data exports.

[### Broken Authorization in APIs: Introducing Autoswagger (7 minute read)](https://www.intruder.io/research/broken-authorization-apis-autoswagger?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Intruder's Autoswagger is a free open-source tool that automatically scans APIs for authorization vulnerabilities by parsing OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to identify endpoints lacking proper authentication checks. The tool discovered critical security flaws across major organizations during bug bounty testing, including exposed credentials, customer data, and database access at companies like Microsoft, multinational tech firms, and beverage corporations. Autoswagger highlights how self-documenting APIs increase attack surface by providing attackers with detailed endpoint information, making these simple authorization weaknesses easier to exploit at scale.
