[### New research: Company mandates increase password manager usage by 2.4x (Sponsor)](https://bitwarden.com/resources/bitwarden-security-impact-report/?utm_campaign=10538385-TLDR%202025&amp;utm_source=TLDR&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=2025_infosec_report)

Weak and reused passwords expose companies to critical risks. In fact, the majority of web application breaches stem from poor credential hygiene, costing organizations millions per incident.

The [2025 Security Impact Report](https://bitwarden.com/resources/bitwarden-security-impact-report/?utm_campaign=10538385-TLDR%202025&utm_source=TLDR&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_content=2025_infosec_report) from Bitwarden surveyed IT managers to uncover what actually drives password manager tool adoption in an organization. The biggest boost came from company-wide mandates, which more than doubled employee usage compared to department-level rollouts.

But mandates alone aren't enough. 35% of organizations still struggle with user reluctance, even with such policies in place. The most effective approach combines executive announcements with technical enforcement like disabling browser-based password management.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### 252M identities dumped online in massive leak affecting 7 countries (2 minute read)](https://cybernews.com/security/identity-records-global-data-leak/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Over 252 million identity records from seven countries—Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Mexico, South Africa, and Canada—were exposed through three misconfigured servers in Brazil and the UAE. These contained government-level profiles with ID numbers, birth dates, contact details, and addresses. The databases had similar structures, suggesting a single operator, but the source remains unknown. Turkey, Egypt, and South Africa were most affected. Cybernews contacted hosting providers, and the data is no longer publicly accessible as of June.

[### Chess.com Discloses Recent Data Breach via File Transfer App (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chesscom-discloses-recent-data-breach-via-file-transfer-app/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Chess.com reported that it experienced a data breach after detecting unauthorized data stored in a third-party file transfer application. The incident only impacts an estimated 4.5K users and may have exposed names and other PII.

[### New TP-Link Zero-Day Surfaces As CISA Warns Other Flaws are Exploited (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-tp-link-zero-day-surfaces-as-cisa-warns-other-flaws-are-exploited/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

TP-Link has confirmed the existence of an unpatched zero-day vulnerability impacting multiple routers. The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher who stated that it is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP). An attacker could exploit it by redirecting vulnerable devices to a malicious CWMP server, which could deliver an oversized SOAP payload, leading to remote code execution.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Malicious npm packages use Ethereum blockchain for malware delivery (3 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4050956/malicious-npm-packages-use-ethereum-blockchain-for-malware-delivery.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Attackers deployed fake GitHub repositories and npm packages that stored malware download URLs in Ethereum smart contracts rather than directly in the code, making detection significantly harder for security tools. The campaign targeted cryptocurrency developers with fake automated trading bots, using packages like colortoolsv2 and mimelib2 that connected to blockchain addresses to retrieve second-stage payloads. The attackers automated thousands of fake commits daily to inflate repository legitimacy, demonstrating sophisticated supply chain attack techniques that combine social engineering with blockchain-based evasion.

[### Subverting code integrity checks to locally backdoor Signal, 1Password, Slack, and more (4 minute read)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/09/03/subverting-code-integrity-checks-to-locally-backdoor-signal-1password-slack-and-more/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A new vulnerability in popular Electron-based apps like Signal, 1Password, and Slack allows attackers to get around code integrity checks by hiding backdoors in overlooked V8 heap snapshot files. Electron's integrity protections often miss these files, meaning backdoors can be inserted without failing code signatures or integrity checks, especially when apps are installed in user-writable folders. This post shows a proof of concept to demonstrate keylogging and privilege escalation with the exploit, showing that even patched applications may have missed attack surfaces.

[### Finding More Zero Days Through Variant Analysis (12 minute read)](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/finding-more-zero-days-through-variant-analysis/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Variant analysis helps identify new vulnerabilities that resemble previously found ones, often caused by incomplete fixes, regressions, or similar code paths in large applications. By combining CVEs with patch history, we can understand how specific vulnerabilities arose and use that knowledge to create Semgrep rules for spotting new issues. This post provides a practical example of finding a vulnerability in the Expat C library through variant analysis of an existing CVE.

Tidal Cyber maps tactics, techniques, procedures, and procedural-level insights to MITRE ATT&CK to tailor security strategies around adversary groups and their behavior for threat-led defenses.

[### Fraction Loader: In-Memory Loader Project (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/amberchalia/fraction_loader/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Fraction Loader is an educational malware project that creates a stealthy in-memory loader capable of downloading, reassembling, and executing payload fragments without touching disk. It uses Windows APIs like VirtualAlloc and WinHTTP to handle encrypted payload chunks, parse headers for order, and reassemble them into executable memory with suitable permissions. While meant for penetration testers and security researchers to learn evasion techniques, it functions as a weaponized dropper that can bypass file-based detection and pose a threat to InfoSec professionals monitoring for in-memory attacks.

[### Flow (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Mixeway/Flow?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Mixeway Flow is a DevSecOps platform that automatically performs four security scans (SAST, SCA, IaC, and secret detection) on Git repositories through webhook integration. It aggregates vulnerabilities from various open-source scanning tools such as Bearer, OWASP Dependency Track, KICS, and Gitleaks into a single dashboard for streamlined security management. The platform simplifies CI/CD pipeline setup and offers thorough application security testing across code, dependencies, infrastructure, and credential exposure.
