### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Ad and PR Giant Dentsu Says Hackers Stole Merkle Data (3 minute read)](https://www.securityweek.com/ad-and-pr-giant-dentsu-says-hackers-stole-merkle-data/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Japanese advertising giant Dentsu has revealed that its subsidiary, Merkle, suffered a data breach that exposed sensitive information about clients, suppliers, and employees. The breach was detected following abnormal activity on Merkle's network, leading to some systems being shut down.

[### RedTiger Malware Steals Data, Discord Tokens, and Even Webcam Images (3 minute read)](https://hackread.com/redtiger-malware-discord-tokens-webcam-images/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

RedTiger, an open-source Python-based infostealer repurposed by cybercriminals, targets Discord gamers (especially French-speaking users) to steal authentication tokens, payment information, browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and webcam images while modifying Discord to maintain persistent access even after password changes. The malware evades detection by shutting down when it detects security tools, employs "mass file and process spamming" (creating 100 random files and launching 400 programs to hinder forensic analysis), and exfiltrates stolen data via GoFile with Discord webhook notifications to attackers. Security professionals should implement multi-factor authentication on Discord accounts, avoid downloading software from unverified sources, and recognize that legitimate security testing tools are increasingly weaponized for credential theft campaigns.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### LOLMIL: Living Off the Land Models and Inference Libraries (8 minute read)](https://dreadnode.io/blog/lolmil-living-off-the-land-models-and-inference-libraries?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

PromptLock is a proof-of-concept malware developed by NYU researchers to operate autonomously using an LLM hosted by the researchers. The author of this post wanted to experiment with building a post-exploitation tool that leverages the LLM included in Microsoft's Copilot+ PCs to create malware that's not dependent on a Command and Control (C2) Server. By providing the malware with tools to identify, modify, and restart vulnerable services, they were able to exploit two services using the LLM in a test environment.

An exploration of Almanax, Corgea, and ZeroPath Security's AI SAST capabilities. The post uses three steps in its evaluation: code retrieval and indexing, code scanning, and false positive detection, deduplication, and severity rating, along with some miscellaneous items like the ease of using the UIs. The author concludes that ZeroPath is the best out of the products tested, followed by Corgea and Almanax.

[### Leveraging Machine Learning to Enhance Acoustic Eavesdropping Attacks (Part 1 of 4) (1 minute read)](https://cc-sw.com/leveraging-machine-learning-to-enhance-acoustic-eavesdropping-attacks-part-1-of-4/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Researchers demonstrated that machine learning can significantly enhance acoustic side-channel attacks by analyzing keyboard typing sounds to reconstruct typed text with high accuracy, exploiting acoustic emanations from physical keystrokes captured via microphones or smartphones. The attacks leverage ML models trained on keystroke audio patterns to classify individual key presses, achieving reconstruction rates that pose realistic threats to password and sensitive data entry in shared or public spaces. Security professionals should educate users about acoustic eavesdropping risks in public environments, consider acoustic shielding for sensitive areas, and promote authentication methods less vulnerable to acoustic side-channels like biometrics or hardware tokens, rather than typed passwords.

[### Keeping the Internet fast and secure: introducing Merkle Tree Certificates (12 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/bootstrap-mtc/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Cloudflare and Chrome are testing Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs) to improve post-quantum signature performance, which are 20 times larger than current ECDSA signatures (ML-DSA-44 signatures are 2,420 bytes vs 64 bytes for ECDSA-P256). MTCs reduce TLS handshakes to one signature, one public key, and one Merkle inclusion proof by batching certificates into Merkle trees with signed tree heads sent out-of-band to clients, compared to today's five signatures and two public keys per handshake. The deployment will use "bootstrap certificates" from trusted CAs to validate MTCs via certificate transparency, starting early 2026 with some Cloudflare and Chrome users to assess performance and ossification issues.

### Miscellaneous

[### SSH LLM Honeypot caught a real threat actor (3 minute read)](https://beelzebub.ai/blog/ssh-llm-honeypot-caught-a-real-threat-actor/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A Beelzebub LLM-powered SSH honeypot successfully detected a genuine threat actor who downloaded Perl backdoor scripts from a compromised Joomla site. The attacker attempted to establish IRC-based command-and-control (C&C) connections using "rootbox PerlBot v2.0" on Undernet channels #rootbox and #c0d3rs-TeaM. Their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) included downloading malware to /tmp, attempting to escalate privileges with sudo, and deploying botnet agents that connected to ix1.undernet.org:6667 for C&C operations. Security teams can utilize LLM honeypots to gather real-time threat intelligence and disrupt botnets by analyzing malware configurations and reporting C&C infrastructure to hosting providers.
