Attackers are using AI to automate lateral movement, mapping your network in seconds and minutes instead of weeks. Why are your analysts are still investigating logs manually?

[Illumio Insights](https://www.illumio.com/insights-free-trial?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_adgroup=insights_week2) analyzes billions of connections in real-time to show you the attack path, not just the alert:

* Detect AI-driven lateral movement before it spreads across your infrastructure.
* Surface anomalous behavior patterns that are invisible to traditional SIEMs.
* See attack paths in their business context: “Dev server → Prod database via RDP” not “172.16.4.5 → 192.168.1.87”.
* Quarantine compromised hosts in one click while AI attacks are still probing.

Microsoft chose Insights during Midnight Blizzard to hunt threats at the speed of the attack.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Joomla! Novarain/Tassos Framework Vulnerabilities (7 minute read)](https://ssd-disclosure.com/joomla-novarain-tassos-framework-vulnerabilities/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Three critical unauthenticated vulnerabilities — arbitrary file read, arbitrary file deletion, and SQL injection — were disclosed in the Novarain/Tassos Framework (v4.10.14–v6.0.37), a shared system plugin shipped with five widely deployed Joomla! extensions including Convert Forms, EngageBox, and Advanced Custom Fields. Chained together, the flaws enable reliable RCE and administrator account takeover by dumping active super admin sessions via SQLi, then authenticating to upload malicious extensions. Administrators should update affected extensions immediately or disable the plg\_system\_nrframework plugin and restrict access to com\_ajax endpoints via WAF rules.

[### Discovery & Analysis of CVE-2025-29969 (13 minute read)](https://www.safebreach.com/blog/safebreach_labs_discovers_cve-2025-29969/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

CVE-2025-29969 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the MS-EVEN RPC protocol — enabled by default on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2025 — that allows low-privileged users to write arbitrary files remotely by exploiting a TOCTOU flaw in the EventLog backup function, effectively bypassing default C$ share limitations. The attack chain combines a hidden CreateFile primitive for remote file/directory existence checks with an arbitrary write primitive achieved by swapping an attacker-controlled EVTX file on a remote SMB share between header validation and backup, enabling code execution via Startup folder batch scripts or DLL hijacking. Microsoft patched the TOCTOU write primitive in May 2025, though the recon capabilities enabling remote file enumeration across domain-joined machines remain unpatched.

[### US Healthcare Diagnostic Firm Says 140,000 Affected by Data Breach (2 minute read)](https://www.securityweek.com/us-healthcare-diagnostic-firm-says-140000-affected-by-data-breach/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Everest ransomware actors accessed Vikor Scientific (now Vanta Diagnostics) data via revenue cycle vendor Catalyst RCM, using compromised credentials to steal about 12GB of files containing names, dates of birth, payment card data, medical details, and insurance information. Roughly 140,000 individuals are currently listed as affected, but the final impact may be higher as counts from all linked entities remain unclear.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### LLMs in the Kill Chain: Inside a Custom MCP Targeting FortiGate Devices Across Continents (12 minute read)](https://cyberandramen.net/2026/02/21/llms-in-the-kill-chain-inside-a-custom-mcp-targeting-fortigate-devices-across-continents/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A misconfigured server exposed a full intrusion toolkit where a threat actor integrated LLMs directly into the attack workflow — using DeepSeek to generate attack plans from recon data and Claude Code to conduct live vulnerability assessments — while targeting FortiGate appliances across 106 countries with 2,516 identified targets. Custom tools ARXON (an MCP server bridging LLM analysis with attack scripts) and CHECKER2 (a Go-based Docker orchestrator) automated the pipeline from stolen VPN config ingestion through internal scanning to LLM-driven exploitation planning, evolving from the open-source HexStrike framework in roughly eight weeks. Defenders should audit for unauthorized VPN accounts, unexpected SSH access, and unapproved firewall policy changes, as the dual-model approach of selecting whichever LLM is most permissive for a given task lowers the skill barrier for managing concurrent intrusions at scale.

[### Novel Technique to Detect Cloud Threat Actor Operations (20 minute read)](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tracking-threat-groups-through-cloud-logging/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Unit 42 researchers introduced a novel detection method that fingerprints cloud threat actors by linking their known MITRE ATT&CK techniques to specific alert patterns. This approach successfully distinguished Muddled Libra (Scattered Spider) and Silk Typhoon operations across 22 industries from June 2024 to June 2025, with only three shared alert signatures out of around 120, highlighting their differing tactics. Industry alert spikes correlated with publicly reported campaigns, such as a 25% rise in transportation sector alerts during Muddled Libra's aviation attacks, enabling defenders to identify threats early by investigating actor-related alerts over a 30-day window.

[### Your Samsung Weather App Is a Fingerprint (10 minute read)](https://www.buchodi.com/your-samsung-weather-app-is-a-fingerprint/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Samsung's pre-installed Weather app quietly creates a highly unique fingerprint from the combination of saved location IDs (placeid) it sends to The Weather Company's API, with 96.4% of sampled devices uniquely identifiable across days. These fingerprints persist over time, survive IP and network changes, and can be resolved into precise locations using hardcoded API keys that work from any client. Requests often include both hashed placeid values and raw GPS coordinates, giving IBM's Weather Company and Samsung rich, granular location profiles that echo a broader industry pattern of monetizing weather-based location data.

TrivySummary summarises Trivy scan JSON output for reporting purposes. Package vulnerabilities are collapsed down to the respective CVE, and headline counts of vulnerabilities at different priorities. As well as the vendor severity and CVSS v3 score provided by Trivy, EPSS scores can also be retrieved, allowing the exploitability and severity of all vulnerabilities to be graphed and prioritised.

[### Siper (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/fksvs/siper?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Siper is a high-performance, XDP-based IP blacklist firewall built with Go and eBPF that drops malicious traffic at the NIC driver level before packets reach the kernel's networking stack. It supports CIDR-based blocking via BPF LPM Trie maps, persistent JSON-based rule management, and real-time drop/pass metrics. The minimalist architecture separates a Go CLI control plane from the kernel-space data plane, offering significantly lower CPU overhead than iptables or nftables under heavy DDoS conditions.

[### Hackers Hide Pulsar RAT Inside PNG Images in New NPM Supply Chain Attack (2 minute read)](https://hackread.com/hackers-pulsar-rat-png-images-npm-supply-chain-attack/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Veracode researchers discovered a typosquatted NPM package called "buildrunner-dev" that delivers the Pulsar RAT by hiding malicious code within PNG images using steganography, extracting payloads from RGB pixel values at runtime. The attack chain employs a heavily obfuscated 1,600-line batch file with only 21 functional lines, detects and evades AV products like ESET and Malwarebytes, and uses process hollowing to inject the final payload into legitimate processes. Developers should carefully verify package names and audit dependencies, as supply chain attacks increasingly leverage image-based steganography to bypass traditional file-scanning tools.
