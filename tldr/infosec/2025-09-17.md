Phishing has gone beyond email. Today's attackers use AI-generated voices, videos, and interactive deepfakes of company executives. They can fool almost anyone - including you and your coworkers.

Backed by $55M+ in funding from OpenAI and a16z, Adaptive Security is the first [security awareness platform built to stop AI-powered social engineering](https://www.adaptivesecurity.com/demo/adaptive-security-awareness-training?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=tldr-infosec&utm_campaign=20250917). Adaptive keeps employees on their feet with tools such as:

* Deepfake phishing simulations of company executives in real-world attack scenarios
* Interactive, customizable training content tailored for each employee (500+ resources)

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### New FileFix Attack Uses Steganography to Drop StealC Malware (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-filefix-attack-uses-steganography-to-drop-stealc-malware/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Researchers at Threat Research Unit Acronis discovered a new FileFix campaign that leverages a multi-language phishing page that poses as Meta's support team warning victims that their account will be deleted if they don't view an incident report. The victim is prompted to copy a file path into Windows Explorer, which contains a PowerShell command that downloads an image that includes an embedded script that downloads the StealC infostealer. The malware then steals credentials and authentication cookies from browsers, messaging apps, cryptocurrency wallets, cloud credentials, VPNs, and gaming apps. It features the ability to take screenshots of the desktop.

[### New Phoenix attack bypasses Rowhammer defenses in DDR5 memory (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-phoenix-attack-bypasses-rowhammer-defenses-in-ddr5-memory/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The Phoenix attack bypasses Target Row Refresh (TRR) protections in DDR5 memory from SK Hynix by exploiting specific refresh intervals not monitored by existing mitigations using patterns spanning 128 and 2608 refresh intervals with self-correcting synchronization. The attack successfully triggered bit flips on all 15 tested DDR5 memory chips and demonstrated a privilege escalation exploit that gained root access in under two minutes, proving that on-die ECC protection is insufficient as bit flips accumulate over time. Tracked as CVE-2025-6202 with high severity, Phoenix affects all DIMM modules produced between January 2021 and December 2024, with the only current mitigation being to triple the DRAM refresh rate, which may cause system instability and 8.4% performance overhead.

[### 40 npm Packages Compromised in Supply Chain Attack Using bundle.js to Steal Credentials (2 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/40-npm-packages-compromised-in-supply.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A supply chain attack compromised 40+ npm packages from multiple maintainers, injecting malicious bundle.js code that downloads TruffleHog credential scanner to search developer machines for secrets like GitHub tokens, AWS keys, and npm tokens. The attack automatically trojanizes downstream packages and exfiltrates stolen credentials to attacker-controlled servers while also creating persistent GitHub Actions workflows that continue harvesting secrets from CI pipelines. A separate phishing campaign targeted Rust crate.io users with fake security emails from rustfoundation.dev attempting to steal GitHub credentials.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### When 'minimal impact' isn't reassuring: lessons from the largest npm supply chain compromise (5 minute read)](https://cyberscoop.com/npm-supply-chain-compromise-brian-fox-sonatype-op-ed/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Attackers successfully compromised 18 popular npm packages with over 2.6 billion weekly downloads by phishing a maintainer with a fake npm support email requesting two-factor authentication updates, then injecting cryptocurrency-hijacking malware into packages like chalk and debug. Although the malicious versions were detected within minutes and only netted about $20 in stolen cryptocurrency, millions of developers downloaded compromised packages during the brief window, highlighting the fragility of open-source infrastructure and the massive potential blast radius of supply chain attacks. The author warns against the "minimal impact" narrative that downplays such incidents, arguing that each successful package takeover should trigger the same urgency as a zero-day exploit, given the thousands of engineering hours required for cleanup and the growing threat of package takeovers by advanced persistent threat groups.

[### Hells Hollow: A New SSDT Hooking Technique (7 minute read)](https://fluxsec.red/hells-hollow-a-new-SSDT-hooking-technique-with-alt-syscalls-rootkit?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Alt Syscalls is a highly undocumented feature of the modern Windows kernel that allows for alternative system call handling. This post demonstrates a new attack called Hells Hollow, where an attacker can hook and modify the actual KTRAP\_FRAME of all syscalls to disable Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) logging on a device. The attack first obtains the address of the trap from the KTHREAD, modifies the \_KTRAP\_FRAME, and then modifies the syscall return value.

[### Shai-Hulud: Ongoing Package Supply Chain Worm Delivering Data-Stealing Malware (6 minute read)](https://www.wiz.io/blog/shai-hulud-npm-supply-chain-attack?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A sophisticated attack on the npm ecosystem emerged on September 16, where malicious packages spread a worm capable of stealing secrets like GitHub tokens, API keys, and environment variables from developer environments. The malware self-propagates by publishing infected versions of any packages it encounters, broadening its impact across the npm registry. Attackers used these credentials to leak sensitive data to public repositories and trigger harmful GitHub Actions, risking the exposure of private source code and credentials.

[### ChatGPT's Calendar Integration Can Be Exploited to Steal Emails (3 minute read)](https://www.securityweek.com/chatgpts-new-calendar-integration-can-be-abused-to-steal-emails/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Attackers can exploit ChatGPT's new calendar integration by sending specially designed invites with malicious prompts. If the victim later asks ChatGPT to check their schedule, the AI can be tricked into searching their email and sharing sensitive information with an attacker, even if they didn't accept the invite. Although this feature requires manual approval and is only accessible in developer mode, the risk highlights the dangers of integrating AI with personal data services.

[### North Korea's Kimsuky Group Uses AI-Generated Military IDs in New Attack (2 minute read)](https://hackread.com/north-korea-kimsuky-group-ai-generated-military-ids/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

North Korea's Kimsuky hacking group launched a new phishing campaign using AI-generated fake military ID cards with 98% certainty of being deepfakes, moving away from their previous ClickFix tactics to target South Korean defense personnel with realistic-looking military identification documents. The attack begins with emails appearing to come from legitimate South Korean defense institutions containing ZIP files with fake military IDs, which, when opened, trigger malicious batch files and AutoIt scripts that install persistent backdoors disguised as Hancom Office updates. This campaign represents an evolution in social engineering tactics, demonstrating how North Korean threat actors are leveraging widely available AI tools like ChatGPT to create more convincing decoys for their cyber espionage operations.

[### Open source Cloud Hypervisor adds (maybe futile) no-AI-code policy (2 minute read)](https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/09/15/cloud_hypervisor_no_ai_policy/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The Cloud Hypervisor project introduced a "No AI code" policy in version 48 to decline contributions generated or derived from large language models, citing concerns about license compliance ambiguity and avoiding legal complications from potential copyright infringement in AI-trained models. Project contributors acknowledge the policy may be "futile" since it's challenging to detect AI-enhanced code, with one suggesting mandatory checkboxes in pull request templates to ensure contributors explicitly acknowledge the policy. The latest version also significantly enhances scalability by increasing maximum supported vCPUs from 254 to 8,192 on x86\_64 hosts using KVM while adding Windows 11 guest support and inter-VM shared memory features.
