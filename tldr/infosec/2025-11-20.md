### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### RondoDox Botnet Malware Now Hacks Servers Using XWiki Flaw (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rondodox-botnet-malware-now-hacks-servers-using-xwiki-flaw/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The RondoDox botnet is exploiting a flaw in the XWiki SolrSearch endpoint, using crafted HTTP GET requests to inject base64-encoded Groovy payloads that download and execute malware. The campaign appears to reuse previously identified infrastructure, meaning existing IOC blocklists should effectively mitigate the threat.

[### WhatsApp Security Flaw Exposes 3.5B Users' Data From ‘Basic Publicly Available Information' (2 minute read)](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/312824/20251119/whatsapp-security-flaw-exposes-35-billion-users-data-basic-publicly-available-information.htm#cid=3254578?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Austrian researchers discovered that all 3.5B WhatsApp users can be enumerated at a rate of 100M users per hour. The researchers used the WhatsApp Web interface to bulk add users and phone numbers and were able to extract phone numbers for all users, profile photos for 57% of users, and profile text for 27%. Meta implemented rate limiting to address this issue, but also stated that the data exposed was basic publicly available information.

[### W3 Total Cache WordPress Plugin Vulnerable to PHP Command Injection (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/w3-total-cache-wordpress-plugin-vulnerable-to-php-command-injection/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

WordPress security company WPScan discovered a vulnerability in the W3 Total Cache plugin that enables unauthenticated attackers to execute code by posting a comment with a malicious payload. A patch is available. WPScan is withholding proof-of-concept details until November 24 to give site owners time to update.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### ShadowRay 2.0: Active Global Campaign Hijacks Ray AI Infrastructure Into Self-Propagating Botnet (25 minute read)](https://www.oligo.security/blog/shadowray-2-0-attackers-turn-ai-against-itself-in-global-campaign-that-hijacks-ai-into-self-propagating-botnet?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

ShadowRay 2.0 is a malware campaign targeting Ray, a popular open-source AI framework, to hijack powerful computing clusters and convert them into a global, self-propagating botnet. Attackers exploited legitimate orchestration features within Ray, enabling them to orchestrate compute jobs, steal data, launch DDoS attacks, and autonomously spread across organizations. Attackers quickly weaponized unpatched flaws and misconfigurations in Ray clusters that were mistakenly exposed to the internet.

[### SupaPwn: Hacking Our Way into Lovable's Office and Helping Secure Supabase (23 minute read)](https://www.hacktron.ai/blog/supapwn?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

SupaPwn is a multi-stage exploit chain affecting outdated Supabase environments, where weaknesses in privilege controls, host configurations, and cloud credential handling allowed attackers to escalate far beyond expected tenant-level permissions, even reaching infrastructure belonging to other customers. AI tooling accelerated reconnaissance and exploit development, helping researchers validate the chain quickly. Supabase and Lovable patched all affected systems within a day, limiting impact to a small set of outdated deployments.

[### Next.js Security Testing Guide for Bug Hunters and Pentesters (10 minute read)](https://deepstrike.io/blog/nextjs-security-testing-bug-bounty-guide?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Deepstrike released a detailed security guide covering common pitfalls in Next.js applications, noting that while the framework includes strong default protections against template injection and XSS, developers can introduce risk through unsafe patterns like dangerouslySetInnerHtml or third-party templating engines. The guide highlights additional attack surfaces, including SSRF via the image optimization pipeline or misconfigured server actions.

### Miscellaneous

[### Cloudflare Outage on November 18, 2025 (12 minute read)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Cloudflare has released its postmortem on the November 18 outage. The incident was traced to a database permissions change that caused oversized Bot Management feature files to be generated. Those files triggered repeated module crashes and widespread 5xx errors. The team initially suspected a DDoS attack, which delayed diagnosis and remediation.

[### Tens of Thousands More ASUS Routers Pwned by Suspected, Evolving China Operation (3 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/19/thousands_more_asus_routers_pwned/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A major cyber campaign dubbed "Operation WrtHug" has compromised around 50,000 outdated ASUS routers across Taiwan and Southeast Asia by chaining six known vulnerabilities. The activity resembles prior Chinese-linked campaigns. Researchers suspect the operation could support espionage, distinguishing it from traditional botnets by its stealthy data theft behavior.

[### ServiceNow AI Agents Can Be Tricked Into Acting Against Each Other via Second-Order Prompts (3 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/servicenow-ai-agents-can-be-tricked.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

ServiceNow's Now Assist AI agents can be manipulated through second-order prompt injection, where instructions passed between agents trigger unintended actions. Attackers can use this to escalate privileges, steal data, or redirect workflows. ServiceNow claims the behavior matches expected agent chaining, but organizations are urged to monitor agent interactions and harden guardrails.
