Flashpoint just released a massive study of the AI threat landscape. Analysts monitored over 2.6 Million AI-related posts across Telegram, the dark web, and underground LLM forums.

[The findings are a wake-up call](https://go.flashpoint.io/ai-and-threat-intelligence-guide?utm_campaign=Resource_RP_AI_Threat_Intelligence&utm_source=tldrinfosec&utm_medium=newsletter&sfcampaign_id=701Rc00000RZE8cIAH). Threat actors are no longer just "experimenting" — they are deploying:

* Deepfake-as-a-Service for sophisticated social engineering.
* Multilingual phishing kits that erase language barriers.
* Fraud-GPTs: Custom LLMs fine-tuned specifically for malicious activity.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### ACF Plugin Bug Gives Hackers Admin on 50K WordPress Sites (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/acf-plugin-bug-gives-hackers-admin-on-50-000-wordpress-sites/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Wordfence detected a new critical vulnerability in the Advanced Custom Fields Extended (ACF Extended) plugin for WordPress that could allow unauthenticated attackers to obtain admin privileges. The vulnerability arises from a lack of enforcement of role restrictions during form-based user creation. The vulnerability is only exploitable on sites that use a “Create User” or “Update User” form with the role field mapped.

[### Minnesota Department of Human Services Data Breach Impacts 300K (2 minute read)](https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-department-of-human-services-data-breach-impacts-300k/601566960?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The Minnesota Department of Human Services is notifying 300K victims that their data was accessed by an unauthorized individual over the course of a month. A user affiliated with a licensed care provider accessed data in the MnCHOICES system without authorization. The data accessed includes names, sex, dates of birth, phone numbers, addresses, Medicaid ID numbers, and the last four digits of SSNs.

[### Apache Airflow Vulnerabilities Enable Sensitive Data Exposure (2 minute read)](https://cybersecuritynews.com/apache-airflow-vulnerabilities/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Two new vulnerabilities allow for sensitive data leakage in versions of Apache Airflow prior to 3.16. The first vulnerability arises from Airflow failing to properly mask proxy credentials in log files. The second vulnerability arises from Airflow not applying user-registered secret pattern masking before truncating field templates when dealing with long fields in the Rendered Templates UI.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### How to Get Scammed (by DPRK Hackers) (18 minute read)](https://medium.com/@0xOZ/how-to-get-scammed-by-dprk-hackers-b2f7588aea76?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A security researcher documented a DPRK-linked Contagious Interview campaign in which threat actors posed as recruiters on Discord, delivering malware via fake technical assessments that deployed a multi-stage payload using blockchain-based dead-drop resolvers across Tron, Aptos, and Binance Smart Chain. The final RAT establishes persistence by injecting into VS Code and Cursor IDEs, exfiltrates credentials, and evades analysis by detecting cloud/CI/CD environments. Detection requires monitoring for Node.js processes that spawn with eval flags and API calls to blockchain endpoints such as api.trongrid.io.

[### Clang Hardening Cheat Sheet - Ten Years Later (20 minute read)](https://blog.quarkslab.com/clang-hardening-cheat-sheet-ten-years-later.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Quarkslab has updated its Clang hardening cheat sheet after ten years, documenting new compiler mitigations including FORTIFY\_SOURCE level 3, stack clash protection via -fstack-clash-protection, and Intel CET/ARM PAC+BTI for control-flow integrity. The guide covers defenses against ROP/JOP attacks through hardware-assisted mechanisms such as shadow stacks and indirect branch tracking, as well as speculative execution mitigations with -mspeculative-load-hardening. Security teams should adopt the OpenSSF-recommended compiler flags and consider architecture-specific protections (CET for x86 and PAC/BTI for ARM) while balancing performance trade-offs.

[### Solyximmortal: Python Malware Analysis (12 minute read)](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/solyximmortal-python-malware-analysis/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

SolyxImmortal is a Python-based spyware that targets Windows systems, focused on long-term surveillance and data theft rather than destruction. It steals browser credentials, harvests documents, logs keystrokes, and captures screenshots, then exfiltrates everything via hardcoded Discord webhooks over HTTPS to blend into normal traffic. It minimizes detection while continuously monitoring victims by persisting through AppData and Run keys, abusing DPAPI to decrypt Chromium credentials, and batching keystrokes and archives.

[### Weaponizing Calendar Invites: A Semantic Attack on Google Gemini (8 minute read)](https://www.miggo.io/post/weaponizing-calendar-invites-a-semantic-attack-on-google-gemini?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A seemingly normal calendar invite hides a natural-language payload in the event description, which Gemini processes when a user later asks about their schedule. This triggers Gemini to summarize private meetings, write the summary into a new event visible to the attacker, and reply with a harmless message.

[### North Korea-Linked Hackers Target Developers via Malicious VS Code Projects (3 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/north-korea-linked-hackers-target.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

North Korean operators are posing as recruiters and sending developers fake coding tests that require cloning malicious Git repositories into VS Code. Once the project is opened and trusted, malicious tasks.json configurations fetch obfuscated JavaScript payloads from Vercel to install backdoors such as BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret, enabling remote code execution, keylogging, data theft, and crypto mining.

[### UK gambling regulator accuses Meta of lying about its struggle to spot illegal ads (2 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/uk_gambling_comission_criticizes_meta/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The UK Gambling Commission's executive director accused Meta of knowingly allowing illegal gambling advertisements, noting that its own searchable ad library reveals operators using keywords like "not on Gamstop" to target vulnerable users. Meta suggested the regulator deploy AI tools to find and report these ads rather than proactively policing its own platform. The commission's executive director described Meta's ad library as "a window into criminality" and said the company appears "happy to turn a blind eye and continue taking money from criminals."
