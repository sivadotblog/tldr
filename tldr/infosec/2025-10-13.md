Many organizations solve software installation problems by handing out local admin rights. This generally “works” in terms of getting software installed, at the cost of creating a massive security threat.

Want to stay efficient without rolling out the red carpet for attackers?

Elevate applications instead of users with [ThreatLocker Elevation Control](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/elevation-control?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=sponsor&utm_campaign=elevation_control_q4_25&utm_content=elevation_control&utm_term=newsletter) - a policy-based endpoint privilege management that puts IT and security in the driver's seat.

A phishing campaign called Payroll Pirate targets university employees by tricking them into giving up credentials for HR platforms like Workday. Attackers use adversary-in-the-middle methods to bypass multi-factor authentication, alter payroll settings and divert paychecks, and hide their tracks by creating inbox rules and adding their recovery phone numbers.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### A small number of samples can poison LLMs of any size (7 minute read)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/small-samples-poison?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Anthropic has found that large language models (LLMs) like Claude can be compromised by injecting as few as 250 malicious files into their training data, regardless of the model's size or the total dataset volume. Attackers can create a “backdoor” in the model triggered by specific phrases, causing the model to behave unpredictably or output gibberish. This finding overturns the traditional belief that an attacker needs control of a percentage of training data: even a tiny, fixed number of documents might be enough.

[### New Rust Malware "ChaosBot" Uses Discord for Command and Control (10 minute read)](https://www.esentire.com/blog/new-rust-malware-chaosbot-uses-discord-for-command-and-control?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

ChaosBot is a sophisticated Rust-based backdoor that abuses legitimate Discord services for C2 operations. It primarily targets Vietnamese speakers through phishing campaigns with malicious Windows Shortcut files that sideload payloads via legitimate Microsoft Edge components. The malware supports reconnaissance commands (systeminfo, ipconfig, and screenshots), delivers secondary payloads like fast reverse proxy (frp) for persistent network access, and employs evasion techniques including ETW patching and VM detection to bypass security controls. Organizations should monitor for suspicious Discord API traffic, unusual PowerShell execution patterns with UTF-8 encoding prefixes, WMI-based lateral movement from over-privileged service accounts, and unauthorized DLL sideloading in Public user directories.

[### DDoS Botnet Aisuru Blankets US ISPs in Record DDoS (10 minute read)](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Aisuru is the largest and most disruptive DDoS botnet ever recorded. It is powered mainly by infected IoT devices with weak security settings. Recent attacks have reached unprecedented data volumes, peaking at almost 30 trillion bits per second and causing significant disruptions, especially for online gaming ISPs like those serving Minecraft. The botnet evolved from earlier Mirai malware, exploits zero-day vulnerabilities, and can rent its network as residential proxies for cybercriminals. An international team manages it. Its rapid growth, boosted by the downfall of competing botnets, has highlighted significant gaps in how ISPs mitigate outbound DDoS traffic.

Threat actors associated with Storm-2603 are weaponizing Velociraptor, a legitimate open-source digital forensics and incident response tool, to facilitate LockBit and Warlock ransomware attacks. The abuse of trusted security utilities allows attackers to evade detection while conducting reconnaissance and lateral movement within compromised networks. Security teams should monitor for unauthorized Velociraptor deployments, implement application whitelisting, and review legitimate DFIR tool usage to distinguish between authorized security operations and malicious activity.
