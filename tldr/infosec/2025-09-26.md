[### Signature sprawl is an IT problem—one worth solving (Sponsor)](https://exclaimer.com/research/state-of-email-report-2025/?utm_medium=via-campaign-referral&amp;utm_source=tldr_newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=tldr&amp;utm_content=state_of_email_report)

IT knows that signatures aren't just a branding issue—they're a governance gap. 92% of IT leaders say well-managed email signatures build trust, but 80% still rely on manual methods like native tools, scripts, or self-service updates. The result: inconsistent formats, compliance risk, and non-stop support tickets.

It's not just any [IT problem](https://exclaimer.com/blog/how-email-signature-updates-became-it-problem/?utm_medium=via-campaign-referral&utm_source=tldr_newsletter&utm_campaign=tldr&utm_content=email-signature-updates-it-problem). 35% of IT teams say managing email signatures is one of their top two time sucks, right alongside spam filtering and storage management.

Read why IT leaders are bringing signature management into the infrastructure layer—and how automation is helping them move from reactive fixes to strategic control.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### PyPI urges users to reset credentials after new phishing attacks (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pypi-urges-users-to-reset-credentials-after-new-phishing-attacks/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The Python Software Foundation has warned of new phishing attacks using fake PyPI sites at pypi-mirror.org and previously pypj.org, which aim to steal developer credentials through emails claiming to be part of "account maintenance and security procedures." Threat actors attempt to exploit stolen credentials to compromise published Python packages by injecting malware or publishing new malicious packages on the legitimate PyPI repository. The foundation recommends that users reset passwords immediately if they have been compromised, use password managers with domain-based auto-fill, and implement phishing-resistant two-factor authentication, such as hardware keys.

[### Malicious Rust Packages on Crates.io Steal Crypto Wallet Keys (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-rust-packages-on-cratesio-steal-crypto-wallet-keys/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Researchers from Socket detected two Rust crates hosted on the official crates.io repository that were impersonating the legitimate ‘fast\_log' crate to steal crypto wallets. The malicious crates maintained the original functionality but also contained a malicious payload that scans the victim's environment and project source files for Hex strings that look like Ethereum private keys, Base58 strings that resemble Solana keys, and bracketed byte arrays that might hide keys and then sends them to a hardcoded Cloudflare Worker URL.

[### Critical Vulnerability in Salesforce AgentForce Exposed (2 minute read)](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/critical-flaw-salesforce-agentforce/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Researchers from Noma Security identified a critical (CVSS 9.4) vulnerability in Salesforce's AgentForce platform that could allow for data exfiltration via indirect prompt injection. The researchers demonstrated that attackers could embed instructions in Salesforce's Web-to-Lead forms, stored as customer data, which would trigger an indirect prompt injection when an employee later queried AgentForce. Salesforce fixed the vulnerability by enforcing Trusted URLs and re-securing an expired domain.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### What I learned extending zero trust to the storage layer (7 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4061829/what-i-learned-extending-zero-trust-to-the-storage-layer.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Organizations consistently overlook storage when implementing zero trust, leaving critical vulnerabilities that modern ransomware specifically targets by destroying backups and recovery points. The author outlines three key principles: controlling network access to storage APIs, implementing just-in-time identity management with separation of duties, and using write-once-read-many (WORM) immutability to protect recovery data. Real-world incidents, such as those involving Change Healthcare and Maersk, demonstrate that without zero trust at the storage layer, even comprehensive security strategies can fail catastrophically during ransomware attacks.

[### Contain or be contained: The security imperative of controlling autonomous AI (4 minute read)](https://cyberscoop.com/security-automonous-ai-threat-response/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Cybersecurity conflicts now operate at machine speed, requiring the removal of humans from tactical response loops, as AI-driven attacks can manipulate critical infrastructure in milliseconds while human-led security operations take hours to recognize coordinated anomalies. The author argues against focusing on making AI "moral" and instead advocates for AI containment strategies that allow probabilistic AI to operate freely within deterministic control boundaries. This approach involves architecting strict interfaces and "digital moats" around AI systems to maintain accountability while leveraging AI's strategic intelligence for defense against machine-speed threats.

[### Inside Salt Typhoon: China's State-Corporate Advanced Persistent Threat (26 minute read)](https://dti.domaintools.com/inside-salt-typhoon-chinas-state-corporate-advanced-persistent-threat/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Salt Typhoon is a Chinese MSS cyber espionage effort that targets global telecoms via contractor ecosystems like i-SOON, maintaining long-term access (about 393 days) to US carriers like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile to harvest data. It uses advanced tradecraft with custom router implants, firmware tweaks, and edge device exploitation, while hiding behind pseudo-private firms such as Sichuan Juxinhe and Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong. Despite its sophistication, it has OPSEC weaknesses, like predictable domain registration with fake US personas and ProtonMail accounts, exposing over 45 domains linked to campaigns targeting US National Guard, UK infrastructure, and EU telecoms.

[### CISA alerts federal agencies of widespread attacks using Cisco zero-days (5 minute read)](https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-emergency-directive-cisco-zero-days/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

CISA issued a rare emergency directive requiring federal agencies to patch or disconnect Cisco ASA firewalls by Friday due to widespread exploitation of three zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-20333, CVE-2025-20363, and CVE-2025-20362) by the same China-linked threat group behind the 2024 ArcaneDoor campaign. The attackers, tracked as UAT4356 and Storm-1849, employed advanced evasion techniques, including disabling logging, intercepting CLI commands, and intentionally crashing devices to prevent analysis while maintaining persistent access to compromise government networks. Despite Cisco beginning an investigation of attacks on multiple federal agencies in May, the company waited four months before disclosing the vulnerabilities and providing patches, raising questions about the delayed response timeline.

[### US banking giant Citi pilots agentic AI with 5,000 staff (3 minute read)](https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/09/24/citi_pilots_agentic_ai/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Citi is piloting upgraded Stylus Workspaces with agentic AI capabilities across 5,000 employees for up to six weeks, enabling automated research, customer profiling, and multi-stage workflow automation using various AI models, including those from Gemini to Claude. The bank's CTO acknowledged that the technology could reduce staffing needs while boosting productivity, although concerns remain about the 30-35% task success rate of agentic AI. This pilot comes as Gartner places agentic AI at the "innovation trigger" stage of its hype cycle while warning that over 40% of such projects may be cancelled by 2027 due to rising costs and unclear business value.

[### Ruby Central's Attack on RubyGems (2 minute read)](https://pup-e.com/goodbye-rubygems.pdf?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Ellen Dash (duckinator), a core maintainer of RubyGems, resigned from Ruby Central following a hostile takeover by Ruby Central of the RubyGems GitHub organization. On September 9, a RubyGems maintainer added Marty Haught of Ruby Central to the RubyGems GitHub enterprise, renamed it to Ruby Central, and removed every other maintainer of the RubyGems project before adding them back, leaving Marty Haught as the owner of the GitHub organization before removing them again later in the month. Ruby Central is the organization that runs RubyGems.org, but the RubyGems project and code are open-source and community-owned.
