[### ThreatLocker Ringfencing: stop attackers from weaponizing apps like PowerShell and Excel (Sponsor)](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/ringfencing?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=sponsor&amp;utm_campaign=ringfencing_q3_25&amp;utm_content=ringfencing&amp;utm_term=newsletter)

Why bother with malware when you can exploit legitimate applications already on the target system? Attackers are increasingly turning trusted tools like PowerShell, Excel, and web browsers into attack vectors.

[ThreatLocker Ringfencing™](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/ringfencing?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=sponsor&utm_campaign=ringfencing_q3_25&utm_content=ringfencing&utm_term=newsletter) stops this by containing applications and limiting how they interact with each other. Even if an attacker compromises a trusted application, Ringfencing prevents it from accessing sensitive data or executing unauthorized commands.

You're essentially adding an extra barrier and [containment layer for your applications](https://www.threatlocker.com/platform/ringfencing?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=sponsor&utm_campaign=ringfencing_q3_25&utm_content=ringfencing&utm_term=newsletter#faq). They can still do their jobs, but they can't be used to move laterally through your environment.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### Python-Powered Malware Snags Hundreds of Credit Cards, 200K Passwords, and 4M Cookies (3 minute read)](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/pxa_stealer_4000_victims/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Vietnamese cybercriminals using PXA Stealer have infected more than 4,000 victims across 62 countries, stealing 200,000 passwords, credit card data, and 4 million browser cookies. The malware abuses legitimate software like Microsoft Word and PDF readers for sideloading attacks, then sells the stolen data on Telegram marketplaces such as Sherlock.

[### Northwest Radiologists Data Breach Hits 350,000 in Washington (2 minute read)](https://securityaffairs.com/180772/data-breach/northwest-radiologists-data-breach-hits-350000-in-washington.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Northwest Radiologists suffered a data breach between January 20 and 25 that exposed the personal information of 350,000 Washington State residents. Compromised data includes names, addresses, Social Security numbers, medical records, and health insurance details.

[### New Plague Linux Malware Stealthily Maintains SSH Access (2 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-plague-malware-backdoors-linux-devices-removes-ssh-session-traces/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Plague is a stealthy Linux malware that had evaded detection for over a year. It acts as a malicious PAM module, using layered obfuscation techniques and environment tampering to avoid detection. The Plague backdoor also scrubs the `SSH\_CONNECTION` and `SSH\_CLIENT` environment variables and redirects `HISTFILE` to `/dev/null`.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### Breaking NVIDIA Triton: CVE-2025-23319 - A Vulnerability Chain Leading to AI Server Takeover (6 minute read)](https://www.wiz.io/blog/nvidia-triton-cve-2025-23319-vuln-chain-to-ai-server?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Newly discovered critical vulnerabilities in NVIDIA's Triton Inference Server allow remote attackers to gain full system control. The flaws (CVE-2025-23319, CVE-2025-23320, and CVE-2025-23334) could enable AI model theft, data exposure, and network infiltration. NVIDIA has released patches, and users are advised to update to the latest version immediately.

[### Exploiting Self-XSS Using Disk Cache (5 minute read)](https://mey-d.github.io/posts/self-xss-disk-cache/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Security researchers have developed a novel technique to exploit self-XSS vulnerabilities by combining login CSRF attacks with browser disk cache manipulation. The attack works by forcing victims to log into attacker-controlled accounts, then using browser history navigation (`history.go(-2)`) to access cached victim data from previous sessions. Organizations can defend against this attack vector by implementing `Cache-Control: no-store` headers on sensitive endpoints to prevent disk cache exploitation.

[### Our Journey From Fragile SSH to Zero-Trust Connections (4 minute read)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tailscale/comments/1lhovjx/tailscale_to_the_rescue_our_journey_from_fragile/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A Redditor shares their journey building an open-source alternative to tools like Vercel and Railway. Initially, users would bring their own servers and provide keys in the UI. However, due to privacy and security concerns, dflow added the ability to purchase servers via AWS, along with a free promo program that was quickly abused. They later discovered that they could use Tailscale to allow servers to dynamically join their network with one command, or even automatically as part of their Dockerfile, without the need to exchange SSH keys.

[### APT36: A Phishing Campaign Targeting Indian Government Entities (8 minute read)](https://www.cyfirma.com/research/apt36-a-phishing-campaign-targeting-indian-government-entities/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

APT36 (Transparent Tribe), a Pakistan-linked threat group, is conducting a sophisticated phishing campaign against Indian government entities using typo-squatted domains that mimic official portals to harvest credentials and bypass Kavach MFA. The operation employs real-time OTP harvesting with C2 infrastructure hosted on Pakistani servers and coordinated domain registrations, indicating state-sponsored backing. Organizations should immediately block identified IOCs, including the domains mgovcloud[.]in and virtualeoffice[.]cloud, as well as associated IP addresses.

[### North Korea Sent Me Abroad to Be a Secret IT Worker. My wages Funded the Regime (10 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15wk77zxngo?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

North Korea sends thousands of IT workers abroad to secure remote jobs at Western companies using hundreds of fake identities, generating $250-600 million annually for the state. The workers use stolen identities from European citizens to apply for US and European tech jobs, often resulting in multiple North Koreans unknowingly hired by the same company. An estimated 85% of earnings are sent back to fund the regime. Security firms report interviewing dozens of suspected North Korean IT workers who use AI face-swapping technology and work from locations where it's never daytime during supposed US business hours.
