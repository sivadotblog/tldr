### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### CVE-2025-11371: Unpatched zero-day in Gladinet CentreStack, Triofox under attack (2 minute read)](https://securityaffairs.com/183259/hacking/cve-2025-11371-unpatched-zero-day-in-gladinet-centrestack-triofox-under-attack.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Threat actors are actively exploiting CVE-2025-11371, an unauthenticated local file inclusion vulnerability in Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox enterprise file-sharing solutions that allows attackers to retrieve machine keys from Web.config files and chain this with a ViewState deserialization flaw (CVE-2025-30406) to achieve remote code execution. At least three customers have been compromised, and while no patch is available, Gladinet and Huntress recommend immediately turning off the temp handler in UploadDownloadProxy's Web.config as a workaround. Organizations using these products should apply the workaround immediately, monitor for suspicious file access patterns, audit exposed instances for compromise indicators, and consider isolating affected systems until patches are released.

[### Threat Actors Weaponize Discord Webhooks for Command and Control With NPM, PyPI, and Ruby Packages (2 minute read)](https://cybersecuritynews.com/threat-actors-weaponize-discord-webhooks/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Socket.dev identified a new malware campaign that uses malicious packages hosted on PyPI, npm, and RubyGeme to exfiltrate data via Discord webhooks. The packages run malicious scripts at install time, which scan for sensitive files and then send them to a hardcoded Discord webhook. This technique is effective as it utilizes a trusted domain that is unlikely to be blocked.

[### Happy DOM Vulnerability Exposes 2.7M Users to Remote Code Execution Attacks (2 minute read)](https://cybersecuritynews.com/happy-dom-vulnerability/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A new vulnerability that can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) was discovered in Happy DOM. The vulnerability is caused by Happy DOM enabling JavaScript evaluation by default, which allows an attacker to escape Node.js' VM context. Happy DOM has released a patched version that disables JavaScript evaluation by default and exposes a flag to safely enable evaluation.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### What to look for in a data protection platform for hybrid clouds (2 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4071098/what-to-look-for-in-a-data-protection-platform-for-hybrid-clouds.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

With 60% of corporate data now residing in the cloud and 80% of enterprises adopting hybrid models, organizations require comprehensive data protection platforms that extend beyond basic security to encompass backup and disaster recovery, business continuity, compliance management, and proactive data monitoring across dispersed environments, including IoT devices, endpoints, and multiple cloud providers. Effective platforms must provide data discovery and classification, vulnerability assessment, layered security measures including encryption and immutability, real-time monitoring and analytics, policy-based access control, automated disaster recovery, and scalability without performance bottlenecks. Data Protection as a Service (DPaaS) is experiencing 33% annual growth. It represents the fastest-growing consumption model, with leading vendors including AWS, Cohesity, Commvault, Dell, Druva, IBM, and Rubrik offering solutions ranging from focused security tools to comprehensive managed platforms.

[### Crimson Collective: A New Threat Group Observed Operating in the Cloud (4 minute read)](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-crimson-collective-a-new-threat-group-observed-operating-in-the-cloud/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Rapid7 has identified Crimson Collective, a newly emerging threat group conducting data exfiltration and extortion attacks against AWS environments by using TruffleHog to discover leaked long-term access keys in code repositories, then creating new IAM users with AdministratorAccess policies to establish persistence. The attackers perform extensive reconnaissance of EC2 instances, EBS volumes, RDS databases, and S3 buckets, then exfiltrate data by creating snapshots, modifying database passwords, exporting data to S3, and launching permissive EC2 instances to facilitate data theft before sending extortion demands. Organizations should eliminate long-term credentials in favor of temporary role-based access, implement least privilege principles, scan repositories for exposed secrets, monitor for suspicious IAM activity, including unusual user creation and policy attachments, and restrict resource access to known IP addresses where possible.

[### EDR-Freeze Tool Technical Workings Along With Forensic Artifacts Revealed (3 minute read)](https://cybersecuritynews.com/edr-freeze-tool-technical-workings/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

EDR-Freeze is a Windows tool that temporarily disables EDR software without the need for a kernel driver. The tool exploits the Windows Error Reporting (WER) system to suspend all threads while it generates a process dump and then holds the dump in that state for a configurable period of time, effectively suspending the EDR. YARA rules can be used to detect the distinct forensic artifacts left by the tool.

[### HTTP to MCP Bridge (2 minute read)](https://www.nccgroup.com/research-blog/http-to-mcp-bridge/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

HTTP to MCP Bridge is an open-source tool that enables security testing of Model Context Protocol (MCP) remote servers by translating between standard HTTP requests and MCP's HTTP + SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport mechanism, allowing researchers to use familiar tools like Burp Suite to assess MCP implementations. The bridge establishes SSE connections with target MCP servers while providing a pure HTTP interface that supports session management, JSON-RPC message manipulation, and asynchronous request-response handling for testing MCP capabilities, including tools, resources, and prompts. Security professionals can leverage this tool to conduct security assessments of MCP-enabled AI systems using their existing HTTP testing toolkit, with future updates planned to support client-side capability testing and local MCP server assessments.

[### How to tell if your mobile number has been hacked and what to do next (5 minute read)](https://cybernews.com/security/how-to-tell-mobile-number-been-hacked-what-to-do-next/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

SIM swap fraud has surged dramatically, with the UK experiencing a 1,055% increase and US victims losing nearly $50 million, as attackers use stolen personal information to impersonate victims and convince carriers to transfer phone numbers to attacker-controlled SIMs, enabling them to intercept SMS-based two-factor authentication codes and hijack financial accounts. Warning signs include sudden loss of cellular service, unexpected SIM transfer notifications from carriers, account lockouts, unfamiliar login alerts, and unusual data usage or app installations indicating active compromise. Security teams should immediately abandon SMS-based 2FA in favor of authenticator apps or hardware tokens like YubiKey, implement carrier account PINs and port-out protection, enable login history monitoring and alerts across all critical services, and educate employees on recognizing SIM swap attacks with protocols for investigating sudden phone service outages.

If 4Chan does not comply, it will be charged an additional £100 per day, up to £6,000, as Ofcom continues its investigation into illegal content and platform risks. 4Chan, meanwhile, is pushing back with legal action against the UK, claiming overreach as a US-based company.

[### Microsoft Locks Down IE Mode After Hackers Turned Legacy Feature Into Backdoor (2 minute read)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/microsoft-locks-down-ie-mode-after.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Microsoft has restricted access to Internet Explorer mode in the Edge browser after threat actors exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in the legacy Chakra JavaScript engine to achieve remote code execution and privilege escalation, bypassing modern Chromium security defenses. Attackers used social engineering to trick users into reloading legitimate websites in IE mode, then chained exploits to break out of browser sandboxing for complete device compromise. Organizations must now manually enable IE mode through browser settings and explicitly allowlist sites requiring legacy compatibility, significantly raising the barrier for attackers while maintaining necessary backward compatibility for enterprise applications.
