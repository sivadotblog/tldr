[### Email is still business-critical. The data backs it up. (Sponsor)](https://exclaimer.com/research/state-of-email-report-2025/?utm_medium=via-campaign-referral&amp;utm_source=tldr_newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=tldr&amp;utm_content=state_of_email_report)

Forget the idea that email is fading. Nearly 9 in 10 IT leaders say direct email is still critical to how their business communicates—more than Slack, Teams, or even collaboration tools. Why? Because email is auditable, reliable, and built for messages that matter.

From infrastructure updates to policy enforcement, 48% of all business communication still relies primarily on email. In high-trust industries like tech and [finance](https://exclaimer.com/white-papers-ebooks/email-signatures-financial-services/), that number climbs even higher.

Read how IT teams are modernizing email without disrupting what works—and why this channel still earns its place at the center of business operations.

### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### FreePBX servers hacked via zero-day, emergency fix released (4 minute read)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/freepbx-servers-hacked-via-zero-day-emergency-fix-released/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

There is an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability affecting systems with exposed Administrator Control Panel (ACP). Hackers have exploited it since August 21, compromising servers and affecting thousands of SIP extensions, allowing attackers to run commands as the Asterisk user. Sangoma has released emergency EDGE module fixes. It recommends blocking ACP access, restoring from pre-August 21 backups if compromised, and rotating all credentials.

### Strategies & Tactics

[### The Agentic Threat Hunter (6 minute read)](https://dispatch.thorcollective.com/p/the-agentic-threat-hunter?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Threat hunting follows the scientific method in which analysts observe logs, develop hypotheses, test the hypotheses, and iterate, but this model is crumbling under the vast amount of logs present in modern environments. To augment security teams, AI agents can be used to monitor vast amounts of logs and develop initial hypotheses to augment security teams. SOCs can begin leveraging agentic AI by developing explicit hypotheses, pairing with AI for investigations, centralizing data in a SIEM or data lake, setting appropriate guardrails for the agents, and then automating repetitive tasks.

This post provides an overview of how to utilize CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, GuardDuty, ALB Logs, and AWS Config for threat detection in AWS. It lists sample alerts for each data source, as well as cross-service alerts, and demonstrates how these alerts can inform automated enforcement actions. Continuous validation is important for ensuring that rules remain consistent with an organization's environment.

[### Sliding into your DMs: Abusing Microsoft Teams for Malware Delivery (5 minute read)](https://permiso.io/blog/sliding-into-your-dms-abusing-microsoft-teams-for-malware-delivery?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Attackers are increasingly using Microsoft Teams for the delivery of malware. Impersonating IT support, they send direct messages or calls from fake or compromised accounts, tricking users into installing remote access tools or running malicious PowerShell payloads. These sophisticated campaigns leverage social engineering, exploit the trust in Teams' internal messaging, and use advanced techniques to steal credentials, maintain persistence, and evade detection. Defenders are advised to remain vigilant for unusual Teams activity and impersonation attempts and to recognize the signs of such malware attacks for improved response and mitigation.

[### Storm-0501 debuts a brutal hybrid ransomware attack chain (4 minute read)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4046438/storm-0501-debuts-a-brutal-hybrid-ransomware-attack-chain.html?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Storm-0501 has developed a sophisticated hybrid ransomware attack that exploits privileged accounts to move between on-premises and cloud environments, utilizing techniques such as DCSync attacks to gain domain control and leveraging federated domains as backdoors. The threat actor not only encrypts data, but also mass-deletes cloud resources, including backups, creating a "no-win situation" where organizations cannot recover without paying ransom. CISOs should implement least privilege access, audit on-premises environments for cloud migration opportunities, and regularly practice ransomware response playbooks to defend against this brutal attack chain.
