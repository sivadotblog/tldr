### Attacks & Vulnerabilities

[### ScreenConnect Super Admin Credential Harvesting (3 minute read)](https://www.mimecast.com/threat-intelligence-hub/screenconnect-super-admin-credential/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Mimecast is reporting on a low-volume spear-phishing campaign that has been active since 2022, targeting super admins of ScreenConnect instances. The attackers send an email warning admins of a new login attempt and prompting them to review it, and if they click through, it directs the admins to an EvilGnix phishing page that harvests their credentials. The attackers use the access to deploy compromised clients and ransomware.

[### Google Ads Used to Spread Trojan Disguised as TradingView Premium (2 minute read)](https://hackread.com/tradingview-scam-expands-to-google-youtube/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A malicious advertising campaign offering "free access" to TradingView Premium has expanded from Facebook to Google Ads and YouTube, using over 500 website addresses and hijacking verified business accounts to spread the Trojan.Agent.GOSL spyware. The scammers take control of legitimate YouTube channels, delete the original content, and rebrand them to mimic the official TradingView page, using unlisted videos and paid advertising to avoid detection. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including passwords, personal data, and cryptocurrency wallet details. One fake video gathered over 182,000 views in just a few days.

[### Children's Names, Pictures, and Addresses Stolen in Nursery Chain Hack (3 minute read)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ldyvpwv9o?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

A new ransomware gang called Radiant has hacked a chain of nurseries called Kido and stolen the data of 8,000 children. The breached data includes names, pictures, and addresses. The criminals contacted the BBC directly and stated that they hadn't asked for a high ransom and viewed it as compensation for performing a pentest, even though no pentest was authorized.

[### Taming 2,500 compiler warnings with CodeQL, an OpenVPN2 case study (4 minute read)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/09/25/taming-2500-compiler-warnings-with-codeql-an-openvpn2-case-study/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Trail of Bits created a sophisticated CodeQL query to analyze 2,500 implicit integer conversion warnings in OpenVPN2, filtering them down to 20 security insights through iterative methods, including range analysis, and focusing on user-controlled inputs. Its five-step approach combined compiler warnings with static analysis techniques such as taint tracking and function modeling to differentiate between safe conversions and potential vulnerabilities. Although most conversions were safe, its team concluded that specialized analysis is necessary to identify risky cases. They did not find any exploitable vulnerabilities but did produce a reusable query for C codebases.

[### Hackers Use Fake Invoices to Spread XWorm RAT via Office Files (2 minute read)](https://hackread.com/xworm-rat-fake-invoices-office-files/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

Cybercriminals are distributing XWorm RAT through fake Spanish invoice emails containing malicious .xlam Office files that appear blank when opened but execute hidden shellcode to download additional payloads. The attack chain employs reflective DLL injection and process injection techniques to embed the malware within legitimate processes, thereby enabling complete remote system control, including keystroke logging and file theft, while establishing a connection to a C2 server at 158.94.209.180. This represents a continuation of XWorm campaigns that have compromised over 18,000 devices globally this year, with attackers increasingly leveraging trusted platforms, such as AWS S3, for payload distribution.

Two 17-year-old Dutch teens were arrested near Europol, Eurojust, and the Canadian embassy in The Hague for allegedly using WiFi sniffing devices to spy for Russia. Recruited via Telegram, they were detained after a Dutch intelligence tip, with one arrest occurring at home while the suspect was doing homework, unaware of their activities. Europol confirmed the incident but said its systems weren't compromised, marking a shift from Russian youth recruitment for vandalism to espionage.

[### Medusa Ransomware Claims Comcast Data Breach, Demands $1.2M (2 minute read)](https://hackread.com/medusa-ransomware-comcast-data-breach/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

The Medusa ransomware group claims to have exfiltrated 834.4 GB of data from Comcast Corporation and is demanding $1.2 million either as ransom for deletion or as a sale price to interested buyers. As proof, the attackers posted approximately 20 screenshots of alleged internal files, along with a listing of 167,121 file entries containing actuarial reports, insurance modeling scripts, claim analytics, and product management data, including files such as Python and SQL scripts related to auto premium analysis. Comcast has not confirmed or denied the breach. It experienced a credential leak in 2015 that affected over 200,000 users. The breach was attributed to credential aggregation and not a system breach.
